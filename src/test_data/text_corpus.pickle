Vwho fall in this fight. I appeal without shame to the persons who enrol these funds to assist my family.  My wife and I have given all for Ireland. I ask my friend David Houston to see Mr W.G. Lyon, publisher of my latest book,<hi rend="underline">underlined text</hi> Literature in Ireland, and see that its publication may be useful to my wife and family. If Joseph Plunkett survives me and is a free man I make him with my wife, my literary executor. Otherwise my wife and David Houston will take charge of my writings. For the first time I pray that they may bring in some profit at last. my wife will want money from every source.\u000ayesterday at my court-martial in rebuffing some trifling evidence, I made a statement as to my negotiation for surrender with general Lowe, on hearing it read after it struck me that it might sound like an appeal. It was not such. I made no appeal, no recantation, no apology for my acts. In what I said I merely claimed that I acted honourably and thoroughly in all that I set myself to do. my enemies have, in return, treated me in an unworthy manner. But let that pass. It is a great and glorious thing to die for Ireland and I can well forget all petty annoyances

VThe father fills his son in on various pieces of family news as Piaras Béaslaí is imprisoned at the time of writing. Responding to his son's previous enquiry about the book collection of the Irish Journalists Association, Piaras's father tells him that while the building was damaged during the 'Dublin trouble', the association managed to rescue the books and records. Besides this, the father recommends a particular edition of the Iliad and Dante, referring to the fact that his son has both Latin and French, which will help as he learns Spanish.

Dante is as interesting as Homer and as difficult to interpret. You will, I am sure, be glad to know that the number of friends who have been enquiring about you and desire to be remembered affectionately to you is very large. Father James, in letters I have had from him, has shown that he is most anxious to hear as often as possible how you are.  His letters of enquiry are extremely kind. He has just been at the annual Clerical Retreat in Killarney. He has not yet told me when or where he is going on his holidays, Since I wrote this I have had a letter from him in which he says he is going to Bray on the 23rd. He wants me to go there also for my holidays. I may be able to arrange to go there about the 29th. The only drawback is that mother will not be able to come, but she is, thank God, in very good health and insists that I must go. Father James has sent a card for you which I enclose, hoping you may be allowed to receive it. He says a number of relatives and other friends asked to be remembered to you. With his letter came one from Mr. J.J. O'Kelly. His expressions of regard for you are most warm-hearted. He has not yet had an opportunity of reading your novel, but he hopes to have time to do so soon and that it may be possible to publish it. He enclosed a note from Mr. Foley who writes: "When writing to Liverpool do not fail to say how delighted <hi rend="underline">we all</hi> are about our devoted P.B.

Father has told you every scrap of news, so I must confine myself to strictly business matters. We have settled that small account with your late landlady, and have recieved all your belongings. They were all carefully packed and arrived safely. I got no books except some publications of your own. I have been troubled over the books and then fancied you might have left them at your office but landlord does not mention anything about them. I believe ha has got your "Bike" and is trying to trace your watch and chain and silver cigarette case etc. I got your your Portland grey ---- navy suit, boots, socks and hat. I have got some of your clothes cleaned, I will get every thing in order for you in your room against your return. I am bearing up well and find my garden and greenhouse a great comfort. I have had a most magnificent show of roses this summer and everything else has flourished as will in the garden and greenhouse. We are expecting Laughford (?) for his holidays on Sunday next and father is going to Bray on Uncle James' invitation, I could not go for I have to meen Laug. They are expecting Charlie O'Callaghan home from London next month and his mother is seriously ill. ------ ------ --- after from Dublin. Things are awfully quiet here now so many people in mourning and so are going away for holidays. I was hoping to see the Murphy cousins one of these days before Sarah (?) returns to college. A great many friends are interested in you and are always enquiring about you. Of course we have no fresh news. God bless you son my darling boy! Keep your spirits up! The time won't be long slipping by and we shall all be happy again at home. With my hearts love, yours fondly\u000aMother.

Father has told you every scrap of news, so I must confine myself to strictly business matters. We have settled that small account with your late Landlady, &amp; have recieved all your belongings. They were all carefully packed, &amp; arrived safely. I got no books except some publications of your own. I have been troubled over the books &amp; then fancied you might have left them at your office; but Langford does not mention anything about them. I believe ha has got your "Bike" and is trying to trace your watch and chain, &amp; silver cigarette case etc. I got from Portland your grey navy suit, boots, socks &amp; hat. I have got some of your clothes cleaned, &amp; will get every thing in order for you in your room against your return. I am bearing up well, &amp; find my garden &amp; greenhouse a great comfort. I have had a most magnificent show of roses this summer, &amp; everything else has flourished as will in the garden and greenhouse. We are expecting Langford for his holidays on Sunday next &amp; father is going to Bray on Uncle James invitation, I could not go for I have to meet Lang. They are expecting Charlie O'Callaghan home from London next month and his mother is seriously ill. Frank crosses over often from Dublin. Things are awfully quiet here now so many people in mourning, no one going away for holidays. I am hoping to see the Murphy cousins one of these days before Norah returns to college. A great many friends are interested in you, &amp; are always enquiring about you. Of course we have no fresh news. God bless you son my darling boy! Keep your spirits up! The time won't be long slipping by and we shall all be happy again at home. With my hearts love, yours fondly\u000aMother.

VMendota Minn Dec 2nd, 1915\u000a\u000aDear Sir:\u000a\u000aWith the report of last Easter collection, I am enclos-\u000aing the little envelope for the Fall collection which ought to come\u000ain next Sunday. This Fall collection serves to meet two of the \u000alargest Parish outlays, the Seminary assessment and the Fuel, both \u000aof which used to be, and are yet in many places two distinct coll-\u000aections, sometimes kept up for several Sundays. What an awful \u000apunishment it would be of my desire to spare people that unpleasant \u000amusic, if one were to confine himself for this one Fall collect-\u000aion to only such an offering as he felt bound to make for each\u000aof these old style levies. This is a good occasion for a worthy\u000athanksoffering to the Lord for the bounties of this year.\u000a\u000a                Sincerely,\u000a                                Martin Mahoney.\u000a\u000a         Easter 1915 Collection\u000a$5.00 James Scott\u000a 3.00 D.

VIn response to a letter from the Piaras Béaslaí, his father, Patrick Langford Beazley, begins by discussing Piaras's current learning of Spanish. He makes literary references to Virgil's Aeneid and Bucolics, and the Idyls of Theocrutus. He refers to his (the father's) recent holiday in Bray. He says that Mr and Mrs O'Connor were in Dublin during the 'troubles' and that they had 'adventures while looking for him'. He says that a man named Langford is not doing very well. He has had a cold and looks rather thin and that he has a problem with his feet. He seems to have recovered somewhat latterly but the father is still concerned about him. He says that he has left Piaras Béaslaí's books and manuscripts at Langfords. He mentions a note made during a meeting of the Anti-Taxation Society that is the property of Piaras Béaslaí. He lists a number of miscellaneous items that were the property of his son. He mentions that a fire damaged the Irish Journalists Association building, in which a number of his son's p

I am very glad that you have been mastering Spanish. It is, as you know, a language wuch has great literary stars as well as being important to-day for practical purposes. I was not less gratified to learn that you are studying Virgil. There is scarcely one of the classical authors from whom you could derive so much benefit under present circumstances. His pictures of the old Roman world are not only charming, but always resposeful and soothing. The Bucolics are more difficult than the Aenid, but they give glimpses of old pastoral romance which repay any trouble through the interest they excite is far inferior to that created by the Idyls of Theocrates from which so much of them is borrowed.

Vgood number of visitors, nearly all from different parts of Ireland, I was told. We went to Dublin on several occasions. I went twice to Gill's to see Mr. O'Kelly about your manuscripts, etc., but he was out each time. I was told on the second occasion that he was going on his holidays. I had no opportunity  of seeing any of your Dublin friends as Father James regulated our movements. He told me that Sara Scanlon (Mrs O'Connor) and her husband happened to be in Dublin during the trouble and had some exciting adventures in looking for you. He also said that Ben's daughter, Frances, is dying in a Paris convent. The only one of the relatives I saw during the holiday was John Clancy. I called at Sandycove and remained just about ten minutes. People told me that I could not look better after the holiday. I certainly felt very well , as I feel now, thank God. Mother, though she has had no holiday, is also well, thank God - in fact wonderfully well. But Langford, I am sorry to say, is not in quite such good form. He spent the three weeks of his holidays here. When he came he seemed to have been suffering from a severe cold. He looked rather thin. His voice was somewhat hoarse, and he suffered in his feet, being unable to walk as briskly as usual. He returned to Dublin a week before I came back from Bray. He then walked nearly as well as usual and his voice was considerably improved, but not quite clear. I wanted him to see a doctor, but he very strongly held there was no need to do so. Mr. Smyth, of the <hi rend="underline">Fireside<hi rend="underline">,has been in Dublin for his holidays and on his return last Monday I asked him how Langford was. From what he said I gathered that Langford still suffers from his feet when walking and that his voice is still husky.

Vas to business. We have left your books and manuscripts at Langford's. I understand that Dr Davitt is the man to apply to for the money due for the shorthand note of the Anti-Taxation Society's meeting. I shall find out his address and write to him. As to what you left in the Irish Journalists' Association's Office, the building was partly destroyed by the fire which raged from Abbey Street down to the river on the occasion of the insurrection, but Langford says the handbag has been saved and also a manuscript in your handwriting. As I stated in my last letter, a souvenir of yours was likewise found and preserved, but there is no account of a stick. The account will be all right. The gold tiepin and belt Langford will get. He has seen Mr. Burke. I have had letters from Messrs O'Kelly, Hegarty, O'Sullivan and R. O'Foghladha, all asking to be cordially remembered to you. Mr. Hegarty said he would attend to your request in regard to the production of your play by the London Gaelic League and the copies of your latest play for Gill's. Your play was not produced at the Gaelic Festival at Waterford. The Festival was held not in Waterford but in Dublin. There were, I am told, no entertainments beyond a reception and a concert. The attendance was large. The lay vice-president was promoted to the presidency and Mr. O'Kelly to the vice-presidency.

As to what you left in the Irish Journalists' Association's Office, the building was partly destroyed by the fire which raged from Abbey Street down to the river on the occasion of the insurrection, but Langford says the handbag has been saved and also a manuscript in your handwriting. As I stated in my last letter, a souvenir of yours was likewise found and preserved, but there is no account of a stick. The account will be all right. The gold tiepin and Belt Langford will get. He has seen Mr. Burke. I have had letters from Messrs. O'Kelly, Hegarty, O'Sullivan and R. O'Foghida, all asking to be cordially remembered to you. Mr. Hegarty said he would attend to your request in regard to the production of your play by the London Gaelic League and the copies of your latest play for Gill's. Your play was not produced at the Gaelic Festival at Waterford. The Festival was held not in Waterford but in Dublin. There were, I am told, no entertainments beyond a reception and a concert.

VThe mother mentions that she is organising to send portraits (probably photographs) to her son. She mentions that the DBC (Dublin Bakery Company) was destroyed during the Rising. She makes reference to a large number of personal acquantices and to their recent endeavours and activities - such as visits to the Curragh races and to a Lieutenant Jack Clancy who had wounded and to a Maudy who had gone on an operatic tour. She says that the prison which Piaras Béaslaí is held in is located in Portland. She asks if she should send him a suit for when he is leaving. She is generally making preparations for his release.

VLetter from Lady Clonbrock (Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), wife of Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock) to Mrs Budson requesting help in the creation of sub-centres in County Galway for the collection of moss for surgical dressings. The moss was to be used for the treatment of soldiers wounded while fighting with the British army during World War I. The Irish War Hospital Supply had requested that the collection of moss was to be increased to meet higher demand and Lady Clonbrock was put in charge of the collection in Galway.\u000a\u000aLady Clonbrock was a member of the Irish Women\u2019s Association and heavily involved in assisting Irish soldiers during World War I.

The Director General of Voluntary Organizations - Sir Edward Ward - suggests that a few main Centres should be formed in Ireland, and I have been asked to form one in this County. I trust I may count on your help, for I am anxious to make our County Collection a great success. \u000aLady Mahon has consented to act as Secretary. I suggest that you should consider ourself a Sub-Centre, and that you endeavour to interst your neighbourhood school children and others to take the Sphagnum Moss to you regularly, and at regular convenient intervals, once a fortnight, if possible, you send your collection, carefully hand picked and "bone dry" by post or rail, addressed to The Hon: Lady Mahon, Castegar, Ballinasloe.

VThe letter is from J. Jackson, a soldier serving with the British army in World War I, to Lady Clonbrock. The letter thanks Lady Clonbrock for cigarettes she had sent via the 'Tobacco Fund' in London. The fund was managed by the 'Weekly Dispatch' newspaper to supply cigarettes to servicemen in the British army and the postcard would have been received by the soldier with the cigarettes. In earlier cards, soldiers gave their unit information but this was stopped by the British authorities for security reasons.\u000a\u000aAugusta Lady Clonbrock was a member of the Irish Women\u2019s Association and heavily involved in assisting Irish soldiers during World War I.

VKilmainham Prison, \u000a3rd May, 1916\u000a\u000aMy dearest Mother, \u000a<p>paragraph</p> I have been hoping up to now that it would be possible to see you again but it does not seem possible-good bye dear, dear mother- Through you I say goodbye to Wow Wow, M.B., Willie, Miss Byrne, Micheal, Cousin Maggie, and everyone at St Enda's- I hope and believe that Willie and the St Edna's boys will all be safe.\u000a\u000aI have written two papers about financial affairs and one about my books which I want you to get. With them are a few poems which I want added to the poem in the M.S. in the large bookcase. You asked me to write a little poem which would seem to be said by you about me. I have written it and one copy is in Arbour Hill barracks with the other papers and Father Aloysius is taking charge of another copy of it. \u000a\u000aI have just received communion. I am happy except for great grief of parting from you. This is the death I should have asked for if God had given me the choice of all deaths-to die a soldier's death for Ireland and for freedom. \u000a\u000aWe have done right.  People will say hard things of us now, but later on they will praise us. Do not grieve for all this, but think  of it as a sacrifice \u000a which God asked of me and you.\u000a\u000aGoodbye again dear mother. May God bless you for your great love for me and for your great Faith, and may he remember all that you have so bravely suffered. I hope soon to see Papa and in a little while we shall be all together again. \u000a\u000aWow Wow, Willie, Mary Brigid and mother-good bye. I have not words to tell you of my love of you and how my heart yearns to you all. I will call to you in my heart at the last moment.\u000aYour's son, \u000aPat\u000a\u000a"Wow Wow", is a sister- "Willie" is the brother who was shot.

In the letter, he mentions that a cousin in Ballinasloe (where Lady Clonbrock was living) was receiving packages from Lady Clonbrock and asks that he could receive some cigarettes as he had no one else to send him goods.\u000a\u000aAugusta Lady Clonbrock was a member of the Irish Women\u2019s Association and heavily involved in assisting Irish soldiers during World War I.

VThe letter is from James (Jim) MacDonagh to Muriel MacDonagh expressing condolences on the death of her husband, Thomas MacDonagh.\u000a\u000aThomas MacDonagh (1878-1916) was a poet and teacher. A leading member of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, he was one of the principle organisers of the Easter Rising and one of the seven signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. He was executed on 3 May 1916 in Kilmainham Gaol (the letter is dated 4.3.1916 but should probably read 4 May 1916).\u000a\u000aMuriel Gifford (1884-1917) married Thomas MacDonagh in 1912 and they had one son. She tragically drowned on a family holiday in 1917.\u000a\u000aJim MacDonagh (1881-1931) was a younger brother of Thomas and became an accomplished musician with the British Symphony Orchestra. In the letter he offers his condolences on Thomas's death and asks for news, mentioning that 'Eva' was unable to write as she was 'so fond of Tom'. He also asks for the address of his brother 'Jack' (John, 1880-1961).

VThe letter is from Corporal W. Bowes, Connaught Rangers, British army, to Lady Clonbrock. Corporal Bowes was a prisoner of war in a German camp in Gustrow. In the letter he thanks Lady Clonbrock for two parcels of food and cigarettes that he had received. He mentions that there is sometimes a delay in receiving the parcels as the men are regularly moved from camp to camp. He also briefly refers to the good weather and the passing the day in the camp.\u000a\u000aAugusta Lady Clonbrock was a member of the Irish Women\u2019s Association and heavily involved in assisting Irish soldiers during World War I.

Meath thanks Clonbrock for his donation of £10 to the Irish Police & Constabulary Recognition Fund.\u000a\u000aThe Irish Police & Constabulary Recognition Fund was founded by Meath to recognise the work of the police during the Easter Rising. It presented certificates, war bonds and awards to policemen who were in active service in the Royal Irish Constabulary or Dublin Metropolitan Police during the Rising and compensation to the widows and dependants of those killed or injured.

VThe letter was written by a niece (May) to Augusta Lady Cronbrock. In the letter, May asks Lady Clonbrock to ensure she will be at home when they make a visit tomorrow. She then refers to a letter sent to by 'Arthur' who was then fighting in France during World War I. May describes the content of the letter and sympathises with Edward's plight, noting that the men are all 'nearly dead with fatigue'. They were marching towards Ypres, many officers had been killed and Edward had been hit with some shrapnel.

VThe letter is from Joseph MacDonagh to his sister Mary MacDonagh. The letter offers condolences after the execution of their brother Thomas MacDonagh in Kilmainham Gaol for his part in the Easter Rising (3 May). Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916) was a poet and teacher. A leading member of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, he was one of the principle organisers of the Easter Rising and one of the seven signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic.\u000a\u000aJoseph MacDonagh (1883-1922) was the youngest brother and went on to serve in the First and Second Dáils and opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\u000a\u000aMary Josephine MacDonagh (1872-1954) was the eldest sibling. She went on to become a nun with the Sisters of Charity. She was the only member of the family to visit Thomas before his execution.\u000a\u000a'Muriel' in the letter is Thomas MacDonagh's wife (1884-1917) and 'Jack' is Thomas's brother John (1880-1961) who had fought under Thomas in the Rising and was imprisoned afterwards.

VNed Lysaght (later MacLysaght) (1887-1986) was born in England but became an enthusiastic member of the Gaelic League and was politically radicalised by the Easter Rising. Although he never became a member, he was openly sympathetic to Sinn Féin. He later became a senator in the Irish Free State.\u000a\u000aDiarmid Coffey (1888-1964) joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became secretary of the Irish National Volunteers after the organisation split in 1915 (it was the other group who participated in the Rising). He later served as assistant clerk of the Seanad.\u000a\u000aIn the letter, Lysaght addresses his proposed solution to the 'Ulster difficulty'. A Home Rule Act for Ireland had been postponed by the outbreak of World War I but was bitterly opposed by Ulster Unionists and considered insufficient by advanced nationalists. MacLysaght encloses typed notes on a proposal that he believes will meet the objections of Ulster Unionists and nationalists, while avoiding the partition of the country, which was considered, though no

VIt is agreed that a golden opportunity for the settlement of the Irish problem has come. Our affairs are in process of being settled by men who were elected as our representatives six years ago. Since 1910 many striking events have occurred each of sufficient importance to Ireland to have justified a general election. In fact, the opinion of independent men, whose views on what is for the good of Ireland are not blinded by their views of what is good for some particular party, is now unheeded and almost unheard. I write this letter as a non-party man, interested in the future of my country, but without special qualification of any kind to speak.\u000aIt seems to me that eight salient facts stand out :\u000aFirst : It is admitted that the old regime is impossible.\u000aSecond : Nationalist Ireland objects to the dismemberment of Ireland by the exclusion of Ulster or any part of it.\u000aThird : Ulster Unionists object to being in the power (as they put it) of an Irish parliament.\u000aFourth : Southern Unionists are on the whole prepared to give Home Rule a fair trial.\u000aFifth : Even in "the four Counties" there is a very considerable Nationalist minority, to coerce which would be as unfair as to coerce Unionist Ulster.\u000aSixth : War taxation has proved that Ireland is not bankrupt. We contribute something like 26 millions now to the Imperial Exchequer; before the was Irish expenditure was, I think, 11 Millions.

VSeventh : The dual control set up by the Home Rule act is likely to lead to friction, as dual control invariably does.\u000aEight : The fuller and more generous the measure of self government, the more likely is Ireland to take a willing place in the British Empire. I believe this myself and South Africa would help to prove it; but possibly it might be regarded by some as a not uncontroversial statement.\u000aTo evolve a scheme which will take account of these facts and meet them in the work which has to be done.\u000aI claim no merit of originality for the following plan : I venture, however, to put it forward because it seems to me to fulfill the required conditions. But I do so rather in the hopes of its forming the basis for better suggestions, than as a cut-and-dried proposal for settlement.\u000aTHe essential features of it are -:\u000a1. A Parliament for all Ireland\u000a2. A Council or Parliament for all Ulster to deal with purely Ulster affairs.\u000a3. Financial autonomy.\u000a4. No Irish members in the British Parliament.\u000a5. Both Ireland and Ulster to be represented as Units on such Imperial Council of the self governing states of the British Empire as we may reasonably assume will be formed after the war.\u000a6. The Ulster Council or Parliament to have a veto in respect of any law not passed through the Irish Parliament by a certain majority.\u000a                                                                                                (2)

V(say 3/5 of the Lower House and a bare majority of the Upper) as regards the application of that law to the Province of Ulster.\u000a7. The Ulster Council or Parliament to have the right of appeal to the Imperial Council in respect of any law, irrespective of the majority by which it was passed, against its application to the Province of Ulster.\u000a8. Election to the Lower House on a basis of population and by proportional representation.\u000a9. Selection of Upper House by process of election by various public bodies and institutions in the Country from among their own members, and ex officio by the tenure of certain ecclesiastical and public Offices.\u000aItems 8 and 9 require a little elaboration even in the comparatively short outline of this kind, to show their force and object. The object of No.8. is to provide minority representation. In order to do so the larger the constituency the better, but anything larger than a single county or city would be <sic>unwidely</sic>. Possibly, even, it might be necessary to divide the larger counties into two, but for the purpose of my present calculations I have not done so. I would suggest one member to roughly every 30,000 persons and I would one member also to all towns over 18,000 inhabitants in order to increase both urban and Ulster representatives; in effect it would add Lurgan, Newry, Dundalk, Drogheda, Portadown, Wexford and Galway to the constituencies. Not counting University members, which should be returned by both Trinity and the National University, we would then have a House of 143, 52 would be from Ulster, 91 from\u000a                                                                                                       (3)

Vthe rest of Ireland. Of these 40 would be returned by cities and towns, 22 from Ulster, 18 from other provinces. It will thus be seen at a glance that a combination of Ulster and urban votes would amount to 74 or a majority of 5. When it is remembered that Ulster, which means generally industrial, interests could not be prejudiced by any law not carried by a majority of 29 (i.e. a 3/5 majority) in a full House, it will be seen that the facts of the case provide better safeguards to Ulster than the paper safeguards which have been so much despised. It is true that parts of Ulster would go against Ulster interests, as we are now considering them, but I have no that it would be more than counterbalanced by conflicting interests among other parties - for no one imagines that the pledge-bound discipline of a single Irish Party can continue in a native Parliament - and by the affect of proportional representation, I believe this in itself would prove a very check on any persecution which, I think quite erroneously, is feared by the minority. By having large constituencies we greatly increase the likelihood of the best minority representation being returned. Thus Dublin and Belfast would each return 13 members, Co. Cork and Co. Down 10, Co. Tipperary and Co. Tyrone 5 each, and so on down to the single member constituencies such as Co. Leitrim. Co. Carlow, Derry, Limerick' and Waterford and other towns I mentioned. These practical safeguards as well in religious as in industrial matters and a senate of a judicial and steady kind would provide additional security.\u000aI do not propose now to go into details on this point, but by way of\u000a                                                                                           (4)

Vsuggestion I would propose that the members of such institutions as the R.D.S., the I.A.O.S., the Royal Hibernian Academy, the College (of) Surgeons and Physicians and so on should each choose one member, or alternatively their presidents might be members ex officio; each county Council could return one or two members; chambers of commerce, ecclesiastical interests could provide representatives in the same way. Commerce, transport, <del>and</del> agriculture<del>al</del> industry, science and the churches would thus have direct representation without the possible waywardness of popular election; and this would I take it, be no negation of democracy in as much as it has never been proposed to give the Upper House greater power than that of suggesting amendments and retarding legislation which it considers unlikely to reflect the will of the country.\u000aIs it too late for Irishmen to attempt something constructive in solving the problem of their own future? The best Irish measures passed in late years have come from the brains of Irishmen. Is the Home Rule Act with which so few were honestly satisfied, inevitably to be taken as the basis of settlement now? It cannot be so taken, I hold, if the settlement is to be a permanent one.\u000a                                                                                                     (5)

VThe letter is from Reginald Brabazon, 12th Earl of Meath (1841-1929), to Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock. Meath requests Clonbrock to form a committee representing 'loyal Ireland' (those in Ireland loyal to the British Crown) to oversee the 'R.I.C. and Police Fund' in Galway and to contribute personally to the fund an amount that would encourage others to do likewise.\u000a\u000aThe Irish Police & Constabulary Recognition Fund was founded by Meath to recognise the work of the police during the Easter Rising. It presented certificates, war bonds and awards to policemen who were in active service in the Royal Irish Constabulary or Dublin Metropolitan Police during the Rising and compensation to the widows and dependants of those killed or injured.

In the letter he writes that he has not yet received cigarettes that Lady Clonbrock had sent to him and remarks that while other men in the camp were receiving bread from Switzerland, he was not getting any and asks Lady Clonbrock to arrange this for him. Maguire also writes that he had not received a letter or parcel from his wife for 18 months and requests Lady Clonbrock to visit her to ascertain what is wrong.\u000a\u000aAugusta Lady Clonbrock was a member of the Irish Women\u2019s Association and heavily involved in assisting Irish soldiers during World War I.

VThe letter is to Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock. It refers to the proposed foundation of a fund to recognise the service of the Royal Irish Constabulary and the Dublin Metropolitan Police during the Easter Rising. As the British government were only willing to do the 'minimum', a fund was being established to reward the men who served and compensate the dependants of those killed or seriously injured.\u000a\u000aClonbrock notes on the letter that he would donate £10 but would not be able to sit on the committee as he feared he would be unable to get many to contribute in County Galway. 'Sinn Fein' was, he believed, so prevalent in the county that people would be 'afraid'.\u000a\u000aSome of the letter is missing but a list is enclosed of names of those who had been asked to contribute and amounts received.\u000a\u000aThe Irish Police & Constabulary Recognition Fund was founded by the Earl of Meath to recognise the work of the police during the Easter Rising.

In view<lb/>\u000aof the above, I have urged the Government both publicly in the House, and<lb/>\u000aalso by private interviews with the members of the Executive in Dublin, to<lb/>\u000aadopt a generous and sympathetic attitude towards the Irish Police and<lb/>\u000aConstabulary, by rewarding those who distinguished themselves and by giving<lb/>\u000agenerous compensation to the widows and dependent relatives of those who<lb/>\u000awere killed or seriously injured during the Rebellion.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>The Government will have to be pressed to do its duty, but<lb/>\u000aexperience has shown that they are not likely to do more than public opinion<lb/>\u000awill demand as a minimum.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>Anything beyond that minimum will I fear have to be raised by<lb/>\u000athose who believe that the security of life and property in Ireland, in<lb/>\u000aview of the stormy days which lie ahead of us, will mainly rest on the<lb/>\u000aspirit and content, of the Irish Constabulary.</p>\u000a\u000a<p>I have been asked to start such a Fund, and Brigadier<lb/>\u000aGeneral Byrne, <sic>Commanding</sic> the Royal Irish Constabulary, informs me that he<lb/>\u000ahas received a cheque for £100 - collected voluntarily by the Special<lb/>\u000aConstables of London for this purpose.</p>\u000a\u000aAs

VDiarmid Coffey (1888-1964) joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became secretary of the Irish National Volunteers after the organisation split in 1915 (it was the other group who participated in the Rising). He later served as assistant clerk of the Seanad.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written in the months following the Easter Rising and refers to Irish political matters, including sharp criticism of the British government, who make the writer 'foam at the mouth' in anger.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written while Ryan was still interned. It is written by a friend who had also been imprisoned after the Rising. In the letter, he comments on a number of his fellow prisoners and refers to some organisations the inmates had set up in Wandsworth prison, including Irish classes attended by Gearóid O'Sullivan (1891-1948, later Adjutant General of the IRA) and others. He also mentions that he does not know what charge will be brought against him

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter is from his sister after Ryan had been sent to Stafford detention camp in England. In the letter, she refers mainly to family (especially their mother) and matters at home. She also mentions some friends who had also been arrested after the Rising in Wexford and were awaiting trial in Richmond Barracks, Dublin.\u000a\u000a'Min' in the letter is another sister, Josephine Mary Ryan.\u000a\u000aTeresa (Agnes) Ryan married Denis McCullough, a member of the IRB and the executive of the Irish Volunteers, in August 1916.

This day week I sent you a note with stamps & note-paper to reply but nothing came.  Then your Mother wrote to the Commandant yesterday, I should say a questioning letter. What care if you are alive and not too badly off.\u000aThings are much the same here. Dick has shaved off the whiskers. The Hollow-back has foaled, ?????? to them all. Kit and Nell are still in Mountjoy, having the time of their lives. Dinny, Seán & many other friends are still in Richmond, all awaiting their trial. They are all being very well treated and in good form. The house ???????? full here with people enquiring after you all. (Mother is in the Cellar - Sat. morning "That'll be two" etc). She is improving very much and can eat everything now. She steals the potato every day at dinner-time. No cabbage now - the Bos has a puss in consequence. All the corn just sown. Jack reads the novel night & day, between Mother's questions.\u000aFr. Gaul is changed and we are getting Fr. M. Murphy Ferns. All delighted here. A little game tomorrow morning. Jim H.O.C comes here strong again. They have a mare on hands - Martin's - for Fair of Ross on Tuesday.

After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter is written by a friend who was also imprisoned after the Rising and is written from Wandsworth Prison to Stafford detention camp, where Ryan was held. The writer refers to some of his fellow prisoners and mentions a visit from Min (Josephine Mary Ryan), a sister of James Ryan. He complains about the strict conditions in Wandsworth, stating that they are much less so in other places. He also mentions that a number of prisoners have been transferred to Frongach detention camp in Wales (where Ryan would eventually be sent) and that he was unsure if we would also be sent there.

Twenty more are following them tomorrow and the rest of us - about another 70 - expect to be removed from here a day or two later.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter is from Katherine Brady (K) and was written while Ryan was imprisoned in Frongach in Wales. She describes in detail a pilgrimage in Lough Derg in which she is taking part (but not enjoying). She also somewhat jokingly refers to the role of northern nationalists in the Irish question and the enactment of Home Rule (which had been postponed owing to the outbreak of World War I). The letter also makes a reference to 'poor Ned' (Ned Daly) who had been executed for his part in the Easter Rising.

VLough Derg\u000a5th July 1916.\u000a\u000aMy dear Jim, You'll be glad to see I'm here doing penance for your sins I'm sure. They must have been fairly numerous if I'm to judge by the bad time I'm having. It's simply awful. We came here on Mon. evg. a party of 15 from Belfast. We count such illustrious personages as Charlie McAuley, Mrs.McEntee, and two sons younger than John, 5 Bradies and a number of fillers up. We're fairly lively, or were till this morning. Yesterday I did Mass in honour of the 4th May & went back to bed again till 10 o.c. Then we all got up & raced in bare feet over sharp stones till we had said about 1,000 Hail Marys. At 6 o.c. we had our 1st & last meal, black tea & dry bread. Then to Chapel for Benediction. 10 o.c. locked into Chapel toll 12 midnight. Only amusement winking at the boys in the row behind & betting on the next person to fall asleep. 12 o.c. interval spent outside in the dark - all sorts of ?chances? but very few taken. Trouble is at the crucial moment you might step on a sharp stone! 10 o.c. about a million Paters & Aves every alternate one standing & kneeling. 4 million of these with 45 min. interval till 5.30. The intervals are quite interesting. The last one enlivened by a row bet. me & an ancient retired German who thinks he owns the island. You'll be astonished to hear he doubts if I'm a lady. Ch.McA. in true pilgrim spirit gave him to understand we were in <hi rend="underline">no</hi> doubt as to his (the German's) rank in society. 6 o.c. Mass & now we have nothing to do for the day, & incidentally have nothing to eat.\u000aI'm sitting on the edge of the island with my feet dangling in the water.

VDiarmid Coffey (1888-1964) joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became secretary of the Irish National Volunteers after the organisation split in 1915 (it was the other group who participated in the Rising). He later served as assistant clerk of the Seanad.\u000a\u000aJane Coffey (née l'Estrange) (1857-1921) was born into a Protestant family but married Catholic George Coffey and became a member of the National Literary Society.\u000a\u000aThe letter is to Diarmid from his mother and refers to a planned trip to London adding that she is glad not to have to travel to Wales instead. She does, however, also note that England is 'unpleasant' for an Irish Irelander (a cultural nationalist) just now.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written after Ryan had been sent to Stafford detention camp in England (the writer learned of this in the 'Freeman's Journal' newspaper). The letter recommends that Ryan visit him Rathfarnham after his release, mentions 'Kate and Nellie' who had been imprisoned in Mountjoy after the Rising on 'suspicion' and also that says his family are well and they were happy to receive his 'long' letter. 'Agnes' and 'Denis', mentioned in the letter, are Ryan's sister and Denis McCullough, a member of the IRB and the executive of the Irish Volunteers who was opposed to the Easter Rising but was arrested in its aftermath. Agnes and Denis were married in August.\u000a\u000aThe letter also refers to Min and Phyllis, two more

VDiarmid Coffey (1888-1964) joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became secretary of the Irish National Volunteers after the organisation split in 1915 (it was the other group who participated in the Rising). He later served as assistant clerk of the Seanad.\u000a\u000aKevin Roantree O'Shiel (1891-1970) also joined the Irish Volunteers but left after the split and became increasingly influenced by separatism, joining the Irish National League, then Sinn Féin and later served as a judge for the Dáil Land Commission.\u000a\u000aIn the letter, O'Shiel refers to a missed opportunity to meet with Coffey while both were in Omagh. He refers to the work of the Irish National League and begs Coffey to cut ties with the Irish Parliamentary Party ('the rotten old British imperial party') and join the INL.\u000a\u000aThe INL (originally the Anti-Partition League) was originally founded by northern nationalists to oppose the Irish Parliamentary Party.

I should certainly have made it my business to get you that day you were in Omagh had you given me any data. When you were not on the morning train from Derry I concluded that you had not come. I was in the Herald office until just a quarter of an hour before you came. I hear you remained in Omagh until 4oc. Is that so? Why in the name of Goodness did you not turn up to us? I am here for a bit of a holiday. We are only about 8 miles from Cloghaneely. Do you know of any

Vstalwarts there that it would be worth my while interviewing? The people here are all splendidly anti-English and anti-Partition & this is Dr.O'Donnell's Tetrarchy!\u000aI am pleased to say that the I.N.L. is going along bonnily. I have already asissted at the establishment of 5 branches and we have now over 40 on our books. When are you coming in? For Heaven's sake leave the rotten old Imperial British Party in Ireland; it is contaminating even to be a passie supporter of it. Write a strong letter to the paper denouncing them and join us. This is a time when no Irishman can afford to hide his light under a bushel.\u000aDid you see that we have several branches already established in London & other English towns and preparations have been made to establish branches in the States. \u000aI sent you a copy of the "Fermanagh Herald" the other day giving account of our great meeting there. I shall send you some of our papers from time to time.\u000aYours Ever,\u000aKevin R.O'Shiel

VLetter from Father Edward F. Murnane, the Presbytery, Dockhead, Bermondsey to Margaret Gavan Duffy (1876-1967), in which he states that he does not wish to trouble George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) with any fresh anxiety but wonders whether she or Gavan Duffy could suggest to Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) to have himself entered as a Catholic on the Creed Register and also to ask that he, Murnane, might be allowed to see him alone on purely spiritual matters. Fr Murnane states that he is sure that \u2018nothing can help him (Casement) bear the shame of this terrible time except the grace of peace that will come from being reconciled to the Church\u2019.\u000a\u000aGeorge Gavan Duffy was acting as solicitor to Casement during his trial for treason. Casement had been arrested in Kerry in April 1916 during a failed landing of German arms for use in the Easter Rising. He was hanged in August 1916. Gavan Duffy was later one of the Irish signatories of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.

VThe letter is from James Stephens to John MacDonagh and refers to the posthumous publication of some of the poems of Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), one of the signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, executed for his part in the Easter Rising.\u000a\u000aStephens writes to John (a brother of Thomas) that all the poems he sent can be published. He notes that he did not 'care for' some of the poems and others were 'carelessly written' and would have been reworked by MacDonagh if he had lived but they should be preserved. He also suggests a later, 'representative' edition of MacDonagh's work. The collection was edited by Stephens and published later in the year under the title 'The Poetical Works of Thomas MacDonagh'.\u000a\u000aJames Stephens (1880?-1950) was a writer who witnessed the events of the Easter Rising and published a famous account, 'The Insurrection in Dublin'.\u000a\u000aJohn MacDonagh (1880-1961) was an actor, playwright and theatre manager who fought under Thomas during the Rising and later worked for RTE.

A few of them I do not care for, & some are very carelessly written - Tommy would have settled them up if he had lived.

VDenis McCullough (1883-1968) was a founder of the Dungannon Clubs (which later merged with other groups to become Sinn Féin) and a member of the Irish Volunteers Executive. Kept aloof of the plans for the Rising, McCullough's attempt to take part in Connacht failed and he was arrested.\u000a\u000aJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written while McCullough was a prisoner in Knutsford prison. In the letter, McCullogh notes his surprise that Ryan had been arrested as he was only serving as a doctor during the Rising and says that he is done 'for life' with Eamonn Dore, who had served as a bodyguard to Seán MacDiarmada during the Rising. He refers to letters and visits from friends and describes prison regulations. Seeing Dublin on his way to En

I hear from Tomcoole occasionally &amp; was delighted to hear about Kit getting home &#x2014; it will be Nell's turn next and I hope soon, too. I had a note from Maureen Cregan yesterday &amp; a letter from Margaret Browne today. Needless to say, they both speak of you in affectionate terms. Margaret's is a screamer. All about a letter they had from Liam O'Brian and a discussion between him &amp; Cole over the value of a beard in <foreign>'affaires de Coeur'</foreign>. In Maggie's best style - always <gap/> Liam's beard is a triumph, I believe. What is your own like? Mine is only incipient yet. The girls inform me that Chris &amp; O'Malley are in Dublin this week.

VKilmainham Gaol, \u000aMidnight, Tuesday, 2nd May, 1916\u000a\u000aI, Thomas McDonagh, having now heard the sentence of the Court Martial held on me today, declare that in all my acts-all the acts for which I have been arraigned-I have been actuated by one motive only, the love of my country, the desire to make her a sovereign independent state. I still hope and pray that my acts may have for consummation her lasting freedom and happiness. \u000a\u000aI am to die at dawn, 3.30 a.m. 3rd May. I am ready to die, and I thank God that I die in so holy a cause. My country will reward my dust richly. \u000a\u000aOn April 30th I was astonished to receive by a messenger from P.H. Pearse, Commandant General of the Army of the Irish Republic, an order to surrender unconditionally to the British General. I did not obey the order as it came from a prisoner. I was then in supreme command of the Irish army consulted with my second in command and decided to confirm the order. I knew that it would involve my death and the deaths of other leaders. I hoped that it would save many true men among our followers, good lives for Ireland. God grant it has done so and God approve our deed. For myself I have no regret. The one bitterness that death has for me is the separation it brings from my beloved wife, Muriel, and my beloved children, Donagh and Barbara. My country will take them as wards, I hope. I have devoted myself too much to National work, and too little to the making of money to leave them a competence. God help them and support them, and give them a happy and prosperous life. Never was there a better, truer, purer woman than my wife Muriel, or more adorable children than Don and Barbara. It breaks my heart to think that I will never see my children again, but I have not wept or mourned. I counted the cost of this and am ready to pay it. Muriel has been sent for here. I do not know if she can come. She may have no one to take the children while she is coming. If she does-\u000a\u000aMy money affairs are in a bad way. I am insured for £200 in the New York Life Co. but have borrowed £101, I think. I am insured for £100 in the Alliance Co. but have a bank debt for £80. That leaves less than £120 from these sources, if they produce anything. In addition I have insured my two children for £100 each in the Mutual Co. of Australasia, payments of premiums to cease at my death the money to be paid to the children at the age of twenty one. I ask my brother Joseph McDonagh and my good and constant friend David Houston to help my poor wife in these matters. My brother John, who came with me and stood by me all last week has been sent away from here, I do not know where to. He, if he can will help my family too. God bless him and my other sisters and brothers. \u000a\u000aAssistance has been guaranteed from funds in the hands of Cumann na Mban and other funds to be collected in America by our fellow countrymen there in provision for the dependents of those who fell in the fight. I appeal without shame to the persons who control those funds to assist my family. My wife and I

Vhave given all for Ireland. \u000a\u000aI ask my friend David Houston to see Mr W.G. Lyon, publisher of my latest book, Literature In Ireland, and see that its publication may be useful to my wife and family. If Joseph Plunkett survives me and is a free man I make him with my wife, my literary executor. Otherwise my wife and David Houston will take charge of my writings. For the first time I pray that they bring in some profit at last. My wife will want money from every source. \u000a\u000aYesterday at my court martial in rebutting some trifling evidence I made a statement as to my negotiations for surrender with General Lowe. On hearing it read after it struck me that it might sound like an appeal. It was not such. I made no appeal no recantation, no apology for my acts. In what I said I merely claimed that I acted honourably and thoroughly in all that I set myself to do. My enemies have, in return treated me in an unworthy manner. But that can pass. It is a great and glorious thing to die for Ireland and I can well forget all petty annoyances in the splendour of this. When my son, Don, was born I thought that to him and not to me would this be given. God has been kinder to me than I hoped. My son will have a great name. \u000a\u000aTo my son Don. My darling little boy, remember me kindly. Take my hope and purpose with my deed. For your sake and for the sake of your beloved mother and sister I would wish to live long, but you will recognise the thing I have done and see this as a consequence. I think still I have done a great thing for Ireland, and with the defeat of her enemy, won the first step of her freedom. \u000a\u000aMy darling daughter, Barbara, God bless you. I loved you more than ever a child has been loved. \u000a\u000aMy dearest love, Muriel, thank you a million times for all that you have been to me. I have only one trouble in leaving life-leaving you so. Be brave, darling, God will assist and bless you. Good bye. Kiss my darlings for me. I send you the few things I have saved out of this war. Good bye my love, till we meet again in heaven. I have a sure faith of our union there. I kiss this paper that goes to you. \u000a\u000aI have just heard that they have not been able to reach you. Perhaps it is better so. Yet Father Aloysius is going to make another effort to do something. God help you and sustain you, my love. But for your suffering this would be all joy and glory. \u000aYour loving husband, \u000aThomas McDonagh

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter is a reply from Madge Calnan to a letter she had received from James Ryan while he was held in Stafford. She fills him in on events and colleague in UCD and of a huge turn in favour of the Easter Rising rebels in the college. She describes the release of a number of the most prominent women arrested after the Rising (Dr Kathleen Glynn should read Lynn) and notes that Count and Mrs Plunkett (parents of Joseph Plunkett) had to live outside Ireland and mentions masses were held for Patrick Pearse, Thomas MacDonagh and Joseph Plunkett who were all executed for their part in the Rising. Madge also asks for some buttons from Ryan's uniform as a souvenir of the Rising and the 'Irish patriots'.

VLetter from Casement, Pentonville Prison, to George Gavan Duffy, in which he urges Gavan Duffy to recover from the High Court of Justice or the Home Office, documents and papers contained in a canvas portfolio which he had brought in from Brixton Prison to give to him (Gavan Duffy). States that they are documents dealing with the trial and that \u2018it is very important that they fall into no hands but yours\u2019. Also states that he has \u2018been wrongfully and most untruthfully assailed in the course of proceedings by the crown witness\u2019. Notes that Gavan Duffy is acquainted with the facts and leaves \u2018 the vindication of my personal honour thus aspersed and falsely charged in your hands\u2019. Also claims that the testimony of the other soldier witnesses was capable of being completely upset had he chosen to defend himself. Thanks Gavan Duffy and his wife, Margaret, and others who supported him, \u2018so faithfully, so bravely and so loyally\u2019. Requests that his last and most recent statements are carefully preserv

They must be legibly written and not crossed. Any which are of an objectionable tendency, either to or from prisoners, or containing slang, or improper expressions, will be suppressed. \u000aPrisoners are permitted to receive and to write a letter at intervals, which depend on the rules of the stage they attain by industry and good conduct; but matters of special importance to a prisoner may be communicated at any time by Letter (prepaid) to the Governor who will inform the prisoner thereof, if expedient. \u000aIn case of misconduct, the privilege of receiving and writing a Letter may be forfeited for a time. \u000aMoney, Books, Postage Stamps, Food, Tobacco, Clothes &c., should not be sent to Prisoners, for their use in prison, as nothing is allowed to be received at the Prison for that purpose. \u000aPersons attempting to clandestinely communicate with, or to introduce any article to or for prisoners, are liable to fine and imprisonment and any prisoner concerned in such practices is liable to be severely punished. \u000aPrisoners' friends are sometimes applied to by unauthorised persons, to send Money, &c., to them privately, under pretence that they can apply it for the benefit of the prisoners, and under such fraudulent pretence, such persons endeavour to obtain money for themselves. Any Letter containing such application, received by the friends of a prisoner should be, at once forwarded to the Governor. \u000aPrisoners are allowed to receive Visits from their friends, according to rules, at intervals which depend on their stage. \u000aWhen Visits are due to prisoners notification will be sent to the friends whom they desire to visit them.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aPhilomena (Phyllis) Frances Ryan (1895-1983) was James Ryan's youngest sister. She worked as a chemist and later the second wife of Seán T. O'Kelly, president of Ireland, having married him after the death of his first wife, her sister.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written by Phyllis while Ryan was still in prison. She refers to letters and parcels that she had sent and asks him what items he would like to be sent in future. Phyllis also fills Ryan in on some of the news relating to friends and family.

VThe letter is from Muriel MacDonagh to Katherine (Kitty) O'Doherty thanking her for money she had received from Jennie Wyse Power (1858-1941). O'Doherty and Wyse Power were both active in the aid associations set up in the aftermath of the Rising to assist dependant's of those killed or injured during the Rising, as well as those who lost employment.\u000a\u000aMuriel Gifford (1884-1917) married Thomas MacDonagh in 1912 and they had one son. She tragically drowned on a family holiday in 1917. Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916) was a poet and teacher. A leading member of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, he was one of the principle organisers of the Easter Rising and one of the seven signatories of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. He was executed on 3 May 1916 in Kilmainham Gaol.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aPhilomena (Phyllis) Frances Ryan (1895-1983) was James Ryan's youngest sister. She worked as a chemist and later the second wife of Seán T. O'Kelly, president of Ireland, having married him after the death of his first wife, her sister.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written by Phyllis while Ryan was still in prison. She refers to newspapers she had sent and to a proposal to send some money or other goods. Phyllis fills in James on friends and family and refers to the upcoming wedding of another sister, Agnes, to Denis McCullough (1883-1968). McCullough ran a piano tuning business in Belfast and had been arrested after the Rising.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aMadge Calnan writes to Ryan while he was imprisoned and refers to a misunderstanding in a previous letter. She tells him about news in UCD and the exams that are going on  (and that she got caught out stealing a book from the National Library). She also mentions a picnic organised that day in Tallaght for the Irish Relief Fund. The letter ends with a reference to buttons from the uniform of another arrested rebel, which Madge wants as a souvenir of the Rising.

Kit (as you may have heard). came out of Mountjoy yesterday morning, also Kathleen Browne, Miss Gifford, Miss Ffrench Mullen, and Miss Shiggins. We gave them a great reception coming out, there were a great crowd of us up outside the prison, a lot of university students, and outsiders too. We took Kathleen and Kit <unclear>down here</unclear> in a taxi and they both have chill. Nell is not out yet. But I think she will be in a day or two. The Count and Countess Plunkett have been ordered away to live in Oxford by the 10th June. & Sr Kathleen <gap/> to Bath by same date. Kit is lucky to get off anyway. And I am sure we'll have Nell soon. There's only yourself now. Otherwise there's not much news now. All the prisoners that are left are being deported tonight. Then there will be about 8 left for trial. Stack and Collins and a few like that. \u000a\u000a<note>PS. have a long letter from Sean T just now. She is in great form. H4No8 he is.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. The letter was sent to Ryan while he was in Stafford detention camp and offers assistance to Ryan and any of the other 'Wexford' prisoners (Ryan was born in Wexford).

VThis is a copy of a letter from F[rancis Hugh?] O\u2019Donnell, London, to George Gavan Duffy. Gavan Duffy (1882-1951) was acting as solicitor to Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) in his trial for treason. Casement had been arrested in Kerry after a failed landing of German arms for use in the Easter Rising. O'Donnell states that the \u2018secret papers\u2019 in question (The Black Diaries) are said to have been shown by the Home Office to the trial's jury. He also lists others who claim to have seen the \u2018incriminating matter\u2019. The 'Black Diaries' contained explicit material about Casement's personal life and were used to undermine his case.\u000a\u000aFrancis Hugh O'Donnell (1846-1916) was a nationalist politician an writer. He died in London in November 1916.

VTomcoole,\u000aTaghmon,\u000a11.7.16\u000a\u000aMy Dear Jim, \u000aI am at home since Saturday last , so I got your letter safely when I came home. I also saw your letter to Kate when I came home, so I will thank you for the two. Tis not much you can write now anyway, but sure we'll try and keep writing to someone over there, and I suppose you can tell a little news to each other. Well first of all I came home unexpectedly on Saturday last.-the same old story cook at the <gap/> one after the other and they won't write but sure I'll waddle away at this one- I had intended staying in Dublin until the end of July with Kit, but I got too stupid to work any more, and I came home for a week to rest, and I shall go back after about a week again and work hard till the end of the month, and then I shall come home again until after the wedding, when I shall go back to exams for the end the 20th September. Did you hear I wonder that I  got 50% for my botany exam-when I need only have got 35, and I working in the middle of the hub hub here in Dublin. Since Saturday I am having a good time although the weather is rotten. Chris of course is in Dublin helping Kit at the intermediate papers. She will come home the end\u000a\u000a<note>Ned Connors fainted in court, did you? or had your trial yet. We'll be having Lily Grant and K Phelan down for the weekend some time I  hear. I shall be back in Dublin in a weeks time again. If I can do anything for you there. Da leads the Wexford list of N.A.A with £5. Money no great! Goodbye. Love from all here.\u000aYrs\u000aPhyllis</note>

Vof this week or early next, when I go back. Kit has got a cold but it is getting better I believe. They have <unclear>Stayes</unclear> helping them too. Of course you know that Min is gone to see Tim Murphy. She will have great fun with Tim I am sure. She will hardly be home for the wedding, nor yourself either I suppose. We are still hoping to have Nell however. By the way I think it is put back to the 16th August, because the Oireachtais is on the 6th August, and as many of us as possible at it, so as to replace all that are away. On the 16th then we will have it, fairly private of course, but still I hear people like Lily Grant are already asked, and of course some of the clergy. Chris is buying clothes above to no end, and talking about them like someone belong to someone else's family you know, talking about her <hi rend="underline">frocks</hi> and that sort of thing. She has got a wedding costume of poplin and everything according. I also have a dress of poplin a cheaper brand of course, as Bridesmaid. I think Agnes has put hers back definitely to September whatever happens. Of course its hard to tell what might happen yet, and all the plans might be changed. Tis now half past ten by Tomcoole time. Agnes and myself have just been over to the Square Meadow.

Vand the latter is doing it, so we drive now every evg about 8 o clock although I'd defy you to know what time that is. Not only is the clock left at the old time but you'd have to calculate how much slow or fast it is well and in the end you'd always be either too late or too early for everything. Nancy Power came down to Browne's yesterday, she had intended coming Saturday, so now we have asked them all up for Friday evg. Fr Peter <unclear>Finlay</unclear> is going to the Priests retreat in Wexford, so of course we'll have him over some evg. We are going to Foulksmills on Thursday evg, and to Ballyhealy on Sunday next. We are well filled in as usual, and of course there is a terrible lot of business going on as\u000a<pb/>

Vwith a turkey and chickens a few days old. We want  to keep them away from the Pup. We were going to put them in Murrintown, but it seems there's pups there too, so now we'll take them to the square meadow every day-something you idle people like us to do. Tom Fitz is outside painting still. He is to finish today I think, and Pat Gaynor has finished all the whitewashing except the chimneys. No hay cut yet, and all the turnips not sown of course. Liz, Agnes, Fr Murphy and myself were at Browne's <gap/> on Sunday evg. The four of us drove the pony. Martin was also there, and no one else only Maisie and Kathleen. We had a nice morning playing croquet and that sort of thing. Yesterday Agnes was in Wexford collecting for the Irish Nationalist Aid Association along with K Browne.

Provides him with news from home stating that Jack got a new office and his 'sisters' are 'still in'. 'Dinny and Sean are gone further on their holidays'. Mamo [P]? house is burnt down in Dublin. The family are satisfied with Fr. Paul's visit to James. Teresa was going to go to Dublin but was told not to 'endanger my throat by going out'. Asks if her brother has come across Sean Mac Entee 'a good looking, white toothed, a dark waving hard youth, a great friend of mine and D's. Look him up'. Dick is 'advanced in his ways and never stops giving out on our side'

VThe letter is from Jane Coffey (née l'Estrange) (1857-1921) who was born into a Protestant family but married Catholic George Coffey and became a member of the National Literary Society. She writes to 'E' about friends and family. The letter is written just over a month after the execution of the 1916 leaders and the 'Basil' she mentions may have been arrested after the Rising or been missing. 'Diarmid' is her son and 'Miss Cesca' is his future wife. She also mentioned Robert Barton, later one of the signatories of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

Vpoor old Kitchener going below. I was in the Kildare St library when the <unclear>Step Ross</unclear> came out and -well- I had an interesting psychological study. (or is that the proper word: should I say physiognomical?)\u000aEverybody <unclear>here</unclear> without exception are burning midnight - I was doing day oil-no-grease in view of the approaching exams-its well to get remorse even at the eleventh hour isn't it:\u000aReally I am chewing my pen to know what I'll say next. Every item of news I mention seems to have been already monopolized by May Moloney or <gap/>  not to speak of Madge Calnan and I've been threatened with I don't know what by May Moloney if I write to long an epistle to you so I think I better bring these remarks to a close with all kinds of nice messages from everyone to you and all our friends.\u000aVery Sincerely yours\u000aFrances Kelly

In any case I must be in the fashion now and write to one of the patriots. To say we enjoy the various letters that are handed round from time to time from the detention camps would only mildly stress it. One person is reading the first page vive voce while a second is declaiming the second or third all at the same time. I gleamed from the whole, various and interesting scraps of information: to wit that you are all going through a course of 'char'-ing, I hope you don't develop "house-maids knee".\u000aHow are the other U.C.D's. Please remember me to them. Mr Dore and Mr <unclear>Des</unclear> Ryan and any others it doesn't matter whether I know them or not. \u000aI suppose you heard the awful news about

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. Peggie O'Sullivan writes to Ryan from Birmingham shortly after he had been moved from Stafford to Frongach. She offers to send a parcel and asks what Ryan would like to receive. She also enquires about conditions in Frongach and suggests sewing sand bags as a 'splendid organisation' and a 'great nerve sorter'.

Vsend me fifty weekly subscription books, I think I shall be able to place all or most of them. I regard the weekly subscription idea as the most likely to bring in the necessary money, and it will also do good from a national point of view.</p> <p>There is a suggestion I would like to make which may not have been put forward already. It is unlikely that the Gaelic Athletic Association will have to contribute any thing to the Entertainments Tax. If that is so, I think it would be an easy matter to get the Central Council of the G.A.A. to adopt the tax scheme in favour of your Aid Association. This is how the thing is worked for the Revenue &#x2014; In the large central offices such as Dublin &amp; Limerick there are rolls of 2d tickets for admission tickets exceeding 6.d. This scheme could easily be adapted to suit your Ass'n. You could <del>buy</del> have the tickets manufactured and the various county committees of the G.A.A. by order of the Central Council would have to buy them from you, paying 1d. or 2d for each ticket (1d. not exceeding 6d. &amp; 2d. otherwise). You could afford to give the paper free &amp; still make a lot of money. A very poor year would amount to at least £1200.</p>

V39th Brigade R.F.A.\u000aB.E.F.\u000a18.1.16\u000a\u000aDear Dermot, \u000aThanks so much for your letter and also for the box of apples which arrived in excellent condition. They are very pleasant in the morning before breakfast and quite make one think I am  home again. \u000aWe have come into rest again for a month. "Rest" is a most misleading term, as we work if anything harder than when in the line. The feeling of not having to fight or be fought makes up for a lot however. Our brigade has been chosen to be inspected by Joffre, which means a desperate lot of worry in the way of cleaning up and getting all sorts of equipment that no one ever sees in the ordinary way. \u000aThis is a rather pleasant little town for a French mining place. The people are full of kindness and we officers are all sleeping in comfortable beds. The best part of the day is when I get into bed, with a lighted candle at my head, and read myself to sleep. \u000aThings must be dullish in Dublin now. Have you been having any long tramps lately? I often think of our walk from Glendalough to Wicklow and how we enjoyed it.

V39th Brigade R.F.A\u000aB.E.F.\u000a2.11.15\u000a\u000aDear Dermot, \u000aThanks for your letters both of which I have received. Strange to say I had already read your contribution to the "Leader". Its one of the papers Val sometimes sends me. I think your squib was quite good, though I rather bar the paper as a rule. I regard it quite as the "Irish John Bull" - yes its a bit thick the King sending Valedictory notices to the Ulster Home Defence Force. Possibly they may have to go to Serbia now and if so I don't mind. By the way I suppose you saw the little prem about Maurice Healy in New Ireland. It was by someone with a Gaelic nom de plume beginning with M, which I forget, and was one of the best things of its kind I have struck..\u000aI have taken up my new duties now and in fact just started. At present I am acting as Adjutant as well until the 11th. I had a very narrow escape of getting the job permanently, and hope to be the next occupant. However I shall have to be careful. There are times when I feel that the delight of thoroughly shocking some of my superiors by my views, would repay me for immediate execution. We expect to go back to the firing line next week. We have been resting and refitting for the last fortnight.

VCopy of a reply letter from Gavan Duffy to Mrs. Dryhurst, 11 Devonshire Hill, Hampstead, and a further copy of an enclosure that Dryhurst had originally sent him, of a letter from Mary Boyle O\u2019Reilly, journalist, to Mrs. Dryhurst, in which O\u2019Reilly states that an American journalist who was told of the existence of Casement\u2019s diaries was not actually shown them. Gavan Duffy\u2019s response to Dryhurst is that she should \u2018not pay the smallest attention to this kind of rubbish\u2019 and wonders \u2018why on earth anyone should try to see the alleged document\u2026as the publishers are already discredited, and it has nothing to do with the matter in question.\u2019

V8 Temple Villas\u000aPalmerstown Rd\u000a21 June 1916\u000aMy Dear Sister Francesca\u000aI should have replied to your letter before this but I have been so busy and upset by one thing or another that I have no time for anything but business letters.  All the same I am really grateful to you for all your kindness to Muriel and her children.  I assure you, she is a very difficult person to deal with, and I fear your goodness is not appreciated. As to Muriel settling down in the country, I don't think it at all likely she would content herself there.\u000aI am glad you are getting a change to Tramore.  It will do you good.  I hope you get out to the sea and that you don't have to wear that appalling dress and veil, which are enough to kill the patience of any poor human.  I'd just like to see you dressed in a nice white dress, with a nice dainty pair of shoes on your nice little feet.   However I suppose you prefer to 'mortify the flesh', and you do it with a vengeance.  Now as to Muriel's story about her box being broken open and rifled.  I think the probable solution of the affair is what Liebert (?) told me.  He said that she had it so tightly packed, that he had to get into it and dance on the contents before he could lock it, and that after that Muriel opened it again and put in more 'stuff''.

Vas he called it.  Probably and most likely the box burst open, of its own incapacity to contain so much and that if Muriel enquired at the station at Thurles, she might get her things back.  Liebert says he did not pack the cup and has no idea where it was put.  But I hope it will turn up all safe.  The last time I saw it was in 29 Oakley Road, when the baby was sitting in her high chair banging this mug on the handle of it, and I dared to suggest to Muriel that a penny tin mug would give the child quite as much pleasure besides being lighter to handle.  I also suggested that it might be advisable to put the silver mug in a place of safety, preferably to lock it up.  But what she did I cannot say.  It is very good of your brothers to offer to help Muriel but at present, at least she has plenty of money, and I don't think it would be wise to let her think she can spend it foolishly, and then expect help elsewhere.  I am saying all this in confidence , as I know Muriel much better than you could.  I am losing dear Liebert tomorrow.  He is sailing from Liverpool on Friday afternoon.  He crosses tomorrow(Thursday) by the 9.20 boat from North Wall, I shall be very lonely without him.  He is such a kind, loving son, but God will keep him and we shall meet again, if not here, in a better world, where there is no sin, no heart-soreness, and where we shall see the face of the Dear Saviour, who loved us and will love us to the end.  God grant that we may all have this glorious experience.  Good bye, dear sister.\u000aEver your loving friend\u000aI.J. Gifford.

VLetter from Casement, Pentonville Prison to Margaret Gavan Duffy, in which he thanks her for the books which she had sent him and requests that she send copies of Easter Week verses to his godsons. Notes that his mind is \u2018far away, down by O\u2019Sullivan Beare\u2019s land-and over there; where I shall never be again, not even in dreams-by Clare and Aran and Garumna. I wonder how it will all be a hundred years hence and whether any of the old speech, and thoughts that sprang from it, and prayers that grew from it will still survive.\u2019

If you see Brigid tell her how much I was gladdened at her faithful affection and remembrance &#x2014; and her prayers &#x2014; beannacht Dé leat &amp; a blessing for myself as too -&#x2014;for I shall not forget you wherever memory goes with me &#x2014;\u000aYours &#x2014; Roger Casement</p>

VThe letter is from Min Ryan to her brother James Ryan. James Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. Min had been romantically linked to Sean MacDiarmada and was one of the last to visit him in his cell before he was executed for his role in the Rising.\u000a\u000aShe writes while Ryan was imprisoned and fills him in on family matters. She describes how she is busy visiting many of the prisoners, including Michael Collins, and wonders why he did not protest about his sentence as he only acted as a doctor in the GPO. She describes how the whole of Henry Street 'was turned upside down during the Rising' and refers to food and other items that she has sent or will send to him.

VThis letter is from Jane Cobden Unwin to her friend Jane Coffey (née l'Estrange) (1857-1921). She first asks for the address of Mrs Bury so she can arrange a visit and then mentions that she would write more but fears that her letters would not reach their destination as martial law was in place in the aftermath of the Easter Rising. She refers to an old shoe maker was arrested after the Rising even though he would not have 'the strength to shoulder a rifle' and also mentions others who were arrested but who had nothing to do with the Rising. She claims Dublin Castle have made a mess of things and hopes for the time when Ireland would have its own parliament.

He was taken out of bed, handcuffed, & taken to Dublin - leaving a wife and 4 children behind him - at present I have promised to look after them.

VReply to James Ryan from his friend Jim Ellis. Ellis hadn't known where Ryan was until he received his letter. He tells Ryan about how their common acquaintances from UCD are getting on in  different Dublin Hospitals. He comments on the rough treatment Ryan had received in Stafford prison before being moved to Frongoch, where he was at the time writing. He mentions not wanting to write about political matters in case the letter is censored.

VNed Lysaght (later MacLysaght) (1887-1986) was born in England but became an enthusiastic member of the Gaelic League and was politically radicalised by the Easter Rising. Although he never became a member, he was openly sympathetic to Sinn Féin. He later became a senator in the Irish Free State.\u000a\u000aJane Coffey (née l'Estrange) (1857-1921) was born into a Protestant family but married Catholic George Coffey and became a member of the National Literary Society.\u000a\u000aThe letter refers to a proposal by Lysaght to convene a conference to discuss the 'settlement' after the Easter Rising. The conference would be composed of some 30 or so 'non political men' i.e. 'not politicians but men who are more prominent in political thought that political action' and would discuss ways to meet the main areas of opposition to a settlement.

VJuly 17.16\u000aCnocsoluis (Knocksullish) Tuaimgréine (Tomgraney) Co.an Chláir (Co. Clare)\u000a\u000aDear Mrs. Coffey,\u000aDermod O'Brien and I have got on sufficiently with our conference idea to be writing to a number of prople (such as Lord Monteagle, Everard, Col. Moore, M?? Deasy, Poe, Sanders etc etc) to get their views as to whether they think a conference desirable and whether they would attend one. The conference would probably be composed of more or less non political men, that is, not politicians, but men who are more prominent in political thought than political action; say 30 or so in all.\u000aIf the present humiliating "settlement" (I cannot help calling it humiliating the way things seem to be turning out) goes on, at least many or all of its details will probably in the end have to be straightened out by Irishmen. If on the other hand it falls through, the recommendations of a conference of prominent Irishmen could, we may fairly hope, have weight with the Government and with the country.\u000aThe three cardinal difficulties in the way of a settlement are (1) the feeling of Irish Nationalists, (2) Ulster (3) England's fear of Irish ??????.\u000aWe have to find a solution which would meet them as far as possible. We have already definite proposals to put before the conference (not my original Home Rule within Home Rule plan). If the people we are

I think myself it right to do a considerable amount of good.\u000aThe name of Sir Henry Bellingham was mentioned yesterday as a most suitable one. Neither of us know him. I believe you do, and perhaps you would ask him tentatively what he thinks of the proposal and would he attend a conference.\u000aOf course there is  nothing definite yet. I shall let you know how things go on. Mr.Bigger? did not send the names; not anyway for the present we are not attempting to get in ?? NE Ulster.\u000aWe might hope, if our conference comes to satisfactory conclusions, perhaps to have a further conference with NE Ulstermen..\u000aYours sincerely\u000aE.E.Lysaght

VThe letter is to James Ryan (1891-1970) from his sister and was written while he was in prison. Ryan was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. He was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. \u000a\u000aIn the letter, she notes that as the other sisters are occupied, she is left to do the correspondence and refers mainly to family matters. She writes that her wedding is to be 'private owing to the recent war so I suppose you will hardly be aksed unless you are back'. She mentions she is delighted at Kit's release (a sister Kate who was arrested after the Rising) but that Nell not yet released.

VThe letter is from Diarmid Coffey to his mother Jane. Diarmid Coffey (1888-1964) joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became secretary of the Irish National Volunteers after the organisation split in 1915 (it was the other group who participated in the Rising). He later served as assistant clerk of the Seanad.\u000a\u000aJane Coffey (née l'Estrange) (1857-1921) was born into a Protestant family but married Catholic George Coffey and became a member of the National Literary Society.\u000a\u000aIn the letter he refers to a week he spent with Kevin O'Shiel (1891-1970) discussing politics. Like Coffey, O'Shiel had been a constitutional nationalist but unlike Coffey he became influenced by separatism during 1916. Coffey states that he enjoyed the discussions but does not necessarily agree with the Omagh nationalists on political matters.

VHighfield\u000aOmagh\u000aCo.Tyrone \u000aJuly 30th 1916.\u000aDear Mother,\u000aI suppese you were surprised to get my wire. O'Sheil met me at the station here & persuaded me to spend the weekend with him. I am very glad I did as I hae had a most pleasant time. His family consists of Mother, two sisters (one a little child) & a brother, the latter a very good looking boy.

VThe letter is from Diarmid Coffey to his mother. Diarmid Coffey (1888-1964) joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became secretary of the Irish National Volunteers after the organisation split in 1915 (it was the other group who participated in the Rising). He later served as assistant clerk of the Seanad.\u000a\u000aJane Coffey (née l'Estrange) (1857-1921) was born into a Protestant family but married Catholic George Coffey and became a member of the National Literary Society.\u000a\u000aThe letter is written from Cork and refers to his stay there. He mentions another guest in the hotel where is staying who is 'disgusted with the behaviour of the English in Ireland' and who commented that John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, was 'weak' after a speech he made in Waterford.

Vpapers.\u000aI don't know yet how it will work out.  I suppose the daily papers, including the evening sheets will be best off, as being best able to press their case.  The wealthier will probably have to play a very small second fiddle.  I see that the Freeman has already dropped the Sunday edition and come down to three sheets.  I am afraid the outlook for extra work is not encouraging.  However keep up your heart.  If any convenient and fairly comfortable post were within reach I think you ought to try and get it.  When times become more flourishing you will be able to choose your own course according to your taste.  I feel very anxious lest you should be in want of money.  Don't let anything prevent you from telegraphing or at any rate writing if you do.  I enclose a one pound note which will be useful.  Do send a couple of words acknowledging it.  The air-raid has caused a good deal of talk here but of course people were not alarmed.  The raiders did not come very near Liverpool. \u000aWith fondest love from mother and myself, \u000aEver affectionately,\u000aFather

VLetter to James Ryan from May Gray. Gray is a nurse in St. Vincent's and a friend of Ryan's. She gives him news of how people in his class got on in their exams and what they are doing now. She tells him that a friend of hers, Michael Collins, is apparently in the same prison as him, and that he should introduce himself to him as he is "a jolly decent sort!"

VDr. Meenan is off duty since Easter practically - McGuinness is giving his classes - I was talking to him today - he says he is going away for a few months. Poor devil he looks rotten. The heart was terrified out of him Easter week. His house was under fire from the Shelbourne for two or three days in fact his windows were well pierced. Needless to remark it was ?Marshall?

He gave me rather a surprise when he wrote to me from prison - I cannot find his note now but as far as I remember he must be with you. Look him up if you do not already know him he is a jolly decent sort. I think I told you about him last year. He knew your sisters in London.

VLetter from Casement, Pentonville Prison, to Father Edward Murnane, in relation to Casement\u2019s conversion to Catholicism. States that he is still perplexed and has doubts about the situation- \u2018There are times when I feel my doubts are settled and then they revive, and I cannot say what motive actuates me-it is very hard to be sure of one\u2019s convictions-to be certain always, one is convinced- I thought I was and today and yesterday I am not sure-and questions come to me from myself that I find no answer to \u2013the trouble is \u2013am I convinced? Or do I only think I am? Am I moved by love-or fear? I can only accept in my soul, from lovenever from fear. The more I read the more confused I get \u2013and it is not reading I want but companionship. I am sure you understand. And then I don\u2019t want to jump-or rush-or do anything hastily-just because time is short. It must be a deliberate act-unwavering and confirmed by all my intelligence. And alas! To try it is not so. It is still, I find, only my heart that prompts

Vand his duty as a soldier. Would it be worth while to bring this man's treasonable activities to the notice of the Daily Mail and the Rebellion Commission.\u000aJ. Moynihan\u000aP.S. You will probably be especially interested in that portion of the evidence produced before the Hardinge Commission which deals with Kerry. County Inspector Hill stated that the Kerry Volunteers mobilised and then in consequence of some arrests got nervous and went home. This is, to say the least misleading. The facts are that on Good Friday Austin Stack and Collins, a Post Office official, were arrested; following the arrests which efffected by stratagem the Tralee Volunteers mobilised and spent some hours parading the town armed and at times proceeding at double pace and, I believe, giving other indications that they were eager for fight. There were not interfered with in any way and dispersed

Vlate that night, presumably tired of their manoeuvres. On Easter Sunday there was general muster at which there were present according to my reckoning from 800 to 2000 men. This was part of a general scheme of Easter manoeuvres all over the country. The manoeuvres were cancelled at the last moment by Headquarters, but were carried out in Tralee owing to the presence of a number of country volunteers who in some cases marched 30 or 40 miles to be present. During all Easter week the country was on the verge of an outbreak but partly to the wishes of Casement which had been conveyed to the local leaders , partly to the impossibility of communication with Headquarters and to the uncertainty of what was going on in Dublin, partly to other causes, nothing happened. But no further arrests were made until May 9th (I think), after the Volunteers had delivered up their arms and when there were between one

I have given up the rag; its politics always objectionable are utterly insufferable under present conditions. If I were to continue reading there is a danger that I should develop a definite homicidal tendency.\u000aAs to Dr. Kane's lectures I have no doubt they will be published in book later on. I shall have a look out and get them for you.\u000aThe last P.S was a happy thought; in these times it would be madness and highly dangerous to the realm to allow so much paper to go waste. Had it not been for the Summer Time Act I might have spent another hour filling in the margins and the spaces between the lines. As a law abiding subject I will let you off for this time.\u000aJ.M.

Owing to the order for darkening the streets and houses at night we are living a curious sort of life at present. We move about after dark like ghosts, sometimes lose our way, and sometimes come up plump against one another, On Wednesday night I came home pretty late and it is not an experience I am fond of. Liverpool last night was almost as dark as Erebus is supposed to be and when I arrived at home I had trouble in finding the garden gate as there is not a single lamp lighted on our street now. I had to light several matches.\u000aMother and I are quite well but we have no news. Dr. Walsh & his wife called on Sunday. It does not look as if there will be any offspring there.\u000aWith fondest love from Mother & myself,\u000aEver affectionately\u000aFather.

VCopy of a letter from George Gavan Duffy to Michael F. Doyle in which he states that Casement went to his death \u2018fearlessly and proudly\u2019 and that it seems \u2018hardly conceivable that the immense efforts made by his friends here and elsewhere are in vain\u2019. Thanks Doyle for his \u2018splendid efforts\u2019. Underneath, a copy of a letter from Gavan Duffy to Colonel Moore (27 July 1916), in which he states that in Ireland the slanders (about the diaries) are being treated with contempt. Also states that it would not be possible to take any step that would not involve a disagreeable newspaper controversy and would probably do more harm than good.

VThis is a copy of a letter from American lawyer John Quinn (1870-1924) to George Gavan Duffy (1882-1951), politician and judge. Quinn was a successful lawyer and friend and patron of many of the leading Irish literary and political figures of the twentieth century. Gavan Duffy had represented Sir Roger Casement (1964-1916) in his trial for treason after he was arrested on the eve of the Easter Rising.\u000a\u000aThe letter concerns an article published by Quinn in the 'New York Times' on 9 September 1916, a month after Casement's execution. He informs Duffy that he dictated notes about Casement which were published by the New York Times a few weeks previously and tates that he spoke frankly but would like Gavan Duffy to confirm his statement about Germany. He also notes that \u2018the English have been circulating reports on Casement\u2019s degeneracy and admits that he was shown what \u2018purported to be photographic copies of his diary and the handwriting looked like his. Declares that \u2018it was a dirty piece of business to

Author says everybody delighted that he is doing better than he originally seemed. She asks if he is in 'Solitary Confinement'. Author accuses the 'English air' of creating 'cannabilistic tendencies'. Mentions that Kit 'has been released...there was to be a great demonstration for her...' Says poor Nell is still 'dangerous' but that Miss Browne and Miss Ffrench Mullin 'are getting out too.' 'None of the last 200 deportees have gone to Strafford'. Author says Pierce Mc & Dinny are goen to Knutford. Also mentions in 'Wandsworth they have a great colony,  Liam C'B, Cole,  Sean D, Gerod, Ginger and Ffrench Mullin.

K.\u000a82 Grove Park,\u000aMy dear Jim,\u000aIts about time I started to write to you isn't it? To tell the truth what has kept me back is lack of moral courage to ask permission. You know writing to an engaged young man is a rather delicate matter & one must set very rigid limits to all expressions of emotion. Dare I say now I miss you? I don't know, I may be led away by my feelings & find myself in the midst of a most compromising declaration. In case I do you can think like Mother Eucharia that 'these student introductions are not recognized in society' - sicut - I'm sure she added. We were all delighted to hear you are doing somewhat better than you seemed to be at first. I hope you aren't one of the ferocious characters who are kept in solitary confinement. A show ought to be started special attractions 'Rare Specimens of an almost extinct species only found in some parts of Ireland'. I'm sure the prison authorities would make a good thing if they charged all you ordinary people 6 to

VSome of the last 200 deportees have gone to Stafford I see. They are divided over Wandsworth, Knutsford & Wakefield. I went to Richmond for the 1st time last Thurs. We could never get at visiting hours of course. We saw Seán T. ?Dinny?, Pierce McCann the Connollys, T. McSweeney, Mal de Mer, Gearóid O'S & several others. They told us a crowd was going off that night, so we all went down the quays on spec. We thought we'd only get waving from a distance, but we terrified the soldiers for they let us walk down beside the prisoners & we talked to them all down the quays. The first I saw were P. McCann and little Mal de Mer. Do you remember him foxtrotting at the dances? I walked? in the line of soldiers till I got shoved out. Then I went back & came on Seán T. spick & span as usual with ?my?, overcoat & evening paper. I got in with himself & ffrench Mullin & nearly got deported myself. They were all in great form except Garóid O'S who was at the far side of rank & looked afraid nobody

She tells him about her new house, the efforts to raise money for the National Aid and a new dress she got for one of the National Aid picnics.

Of course all this must be fearfully dry for the censor, what a pity I haven't time to make a sketch of G. O'D so that he might join in the joke. Don't forget to give my love to anyone in the camp that you think I might know or who might know me, especially S Peeson, D McCullogh, Jack Gogan ( I know him since I was a kid!!). I will be writing to them very soon. Maureen will be in this evening, that is provided she doesn't go teaing with a certain architect, Mums the word now Jim, just a few little words dropped and I added up one and one and made two, I may after a while add two and two and possibly make four, so I would advise you not to loose any time coming home or the bird might have flown, and I guess you wouldn't like your little heart to be broken!!! would you????!!!

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. The letter was sent by Kathleen Teebay who seems to have befriended Ryan while he was in Stafford and was sent shortly after transfer to Frongach. Ryan was prisoner number F50 in Stafford Detention Camp. In the letter, Kathleen mentions a meeting with the mother and sister of Patrick and Willie Pearse, executed for their role in the Rising, who had made a visit to Stafford.

Father Moore called in last night & said so far he had heard nothing. This morning he sent a message for me to call to see him. I do so & it was to show me a letter he had received from the Chaplain. But as he lives a good distance, almost 30 miles I think, it did not give much news. He is an old Cottonian (a College for boys in the

We were quite glad to hear it  because it seemed to make a link still with you as we know ?Coilín? - my brother was there a long time but of course at a much later date. So we trust to hear further details later.\u000aI have already sent you one letter. I wrote it Saturday - but as the address was doubtful I am not sure that you have received it. If you have & if I tell you the same things again you must excuse it because that is the reason.\u000aIn it I told you I got to know Mr.Duffy and Mr.Caralon (from Belfast) by taking a message about collars & ties etc. for Mrs.Figgis. The former said he knew you at any rate by sight & I gave him a message for you in case he sees you. Mr.Caralon

But I daresay you will like it better as you will have discovered your other friends down there & others have gone on from here. I think the warder in the gate was rather glad because he said he is spared writing down your name. He thought you were the most popular in the barracks, he had to do it so often. Father Moore happened to call in Thursday night - the 29th. He said it was not the same place down there now that all the nuts had gone.\u000aMrs. & Miss Pearse came to Stafford on Friday night & we were lucky to see a good deal of them. Last night they left for Shrewsbury en route for Frongoch which they intend to visit today, but I am glad to say they are returning here for a short time.

VThe priests here said the Masses on Sunday & Monday for her two sons & she was awfully pleased about it. She told us a great many details. It was very sad but she is so sweet & so wonderfully brave. She said "My loss is an irreparable one but knowing what it is, if I was asked to make the sacrifice again tomorrow, I would do it just as gladly". She promised to send some mortuary cards. I did not like to ask for one though I wanted to do so badly but she turned to me & said "You shall have one - I won't forget". I was so thankful to have had the opportunity of meeting her & I am sure I will be different all my life for having done so.\u000aI do hope your cold is better - if you only had stayed a bit longer you would have had more medicine & then probably the cure would have been complete. If you have to do your own washing be careful not to put on anything damp or else you will get it again.\u000aI wish I knew your new number - I have asked my friend to ask Mr.O'Connell when he writes to him & let me know.\u000aGoodbye for the present - Yours very sincerely\u000aKathleen Teebay.

After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister. The letter is sent to Liam Ó Briain (1888-1874) who was then imprisoned in Wandsworth Prison in London. Ó Briain was a member of the Irish Volunteers in Dublin but had been unable to find his company on the outbreak of the Rising and instead fought under Michael Mallin in St Stephen's Green and the Royal College of Surgeons. He later became a renowned scholar of Romance languages.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe letter was sent from Stafford Detention Camp shortly before both men were transferred to Frongoch. In the letter, Ryan refers to Harry Nicholls [spelled 'Nichols' in the letter] who, like Ó Briain had been unable to find his company and served under Mallin. The letter also refers to a number of others who were imprisoned after t

Vsettled good weather. Let us have a line to let us know how you are and how things are with you. I suppose in Dublin, as here, the tendency in newspaper work is to Economy. However there is less inclination here now than there was at the declaration of war to be alarmed. A good number of men have gone to the colours from the newspaper staffs. The difficulty of making one's way at night in as great as ever, but fortunately the evenings are growing long. I am told that D McCarthy's death was a terrible one. A heavy car or wagon must have passed over him. He was taken to the hospital and the priest came before he died, but he was unconscious. We have no news, but are quite well, thank God. We here now and again from Carey and he always enquires about you. Don't forget to write.\u000aWith fondest love from Mother and myself, Ever affectionately Father.

VLetter from the father of Piaras Béaslaí to Piaras on his article on the Irish Language. The contrasting attitude of Welsh policemen to the Welsh language compared to the Irish policemen to the Irish language is referred to. He states that if a Welshman was ordered to speak English instead of Welsh by the police, the whole country would be furious. However in Ireland only English is allowed. The continuing blackout is also mentioned.

Here, as you say, we are in the safest part of England, but for all that dangers are plentiful enough. Being out on Wednesday night, as for the electric car I had to go I am bound to be, is like going through a skirmish. Last night I had no one with me when I left the printing works and to get to Dale Street I had to go through a little street beside the Courier office which has not a single light in it. Mid-way I could hear footsteps quite near me, but could see no one. The sensation is not reassuring. However, I got home quite safely,

Vthank God, though I am sometimes a little puzzled as to where Rudgrave Square is when coming in the car. That question of Kitty Clancy's was quite characteristic. The Irish daily papers have been very irregular in coming of late. They give precious little news about Ireland and the Freeman's appearance has become particularly emaciated. We are well, thank God, but, as usual without news. Carey has slackened off in his correspondence and it is a month or more since I have had a letter from him. Dr Walsh and his wife often call on Sundays. Take good care of your health and don't fail to let us hear from you soon.\u000aWith fondest love from Mother and myself,\u000aEver affectionately,\u000aFather

I began to wonder whether I had received a summons for something or other when I turned it and lo, there were your own handwriting and signature. As you can imagine the strain on me for some time previously was pretty severe, but this was the first time I gave way to the weakness of tears. It was like having you with us again for a while. Of course Mother and I read and re-read the letter and indeed were charmed with the spirit of it. It is just the kind of letter we hoped for - bright, brave, cheerful and showing a disposition to accept ?exerting? conditions contentedly. I cannot say how glad I was to find not only that you were well, thank God, but that you were accepting  your position philosophically and resolved to comply with the rules. Wherever one is one can be happy by striving to do God's Will.\u000aYou will be anxious to know how Mother is and how she bears up. Thank God she is quite well and has bourne up wonderfully.

He comments on the large number of young women who took part in the Rising and are now imprisoned in Kilmainham and Mountjoy prisons. He mentions the current censorship of all letters to and from America.

Vfor good many of them being out of jail today probably.\u000aThe newspapers state that the government had made arrangements to suppress the Irish volunteer organisation on the day in which it broke forth.  100 of the leaders were to be arrested and deported and all were to be disarmed.  You will be interested to hear that the National volunteers (Mr Redmond's volunteers) loyally assisted the military in various parts of the country in putting down the Rebellion.  So that when you hear over there that we are a rebelly lot, you will be able to realise that we are not all as black as we are painted.  The 'Kilkenny Journal' in a burst of indignation informed the world that Mr Redmond's volunteers in that town paraded the streets, headed by a piper's band to celebrate the shooting of the first batch of rebels, who were shot by order of court marshal.  What a satisfaction it must be to Mr Redmond today to realise that the sentiments of loyalty which he implanted so carefully in the breasts of his followers has borne such good fruit.

VPierce Beasley got 3 years.\u000aIt was a sad business all round but I believe the rebels did terrible havoc among the military too.  They fought with tremendous bravery and even Mr Asquith paid a tribute to their 'bravery and to their 'clean fighting' in the English House of Commons.  One thing is to be placed to their credit, all declare and that is that they knew how to fight and they knew how to die.  The last words of Pierce as he faced the guns were 'Ireland is unconquered and unconquerable' and he was singing 'A Nation Once Again' as he fell.  They all refused to have their eyes bandaged saying that they wished to face their executioners.  Rebels against the Crown and Constitution of course but brave men all.  The firing party paid them that tribute.  Isn't it sad to think of such men under the sod, instead of leading their men against the common foe in France and Flanders.  If they had taken Mr Redmond's advice they might

They fought with the men, many of them sniping away with rifles and doing serious damage by all accounts.  I read an article written by an English Red Cross nurse who was all through the business in the London 'Daily Express' a few days ago.  She paid a wonderful tribute to the bravery of the girls and stated that they acted as messengers in many cases, going into the zone of fire with the utmost nonchalance.  It was a question of honour with them she states to carry through their orders or to be shot.  She was present on one occasion when a volunteer Captain asked for a volunteer to carry a message to one of his colleagues.  The carrying of the message necessitated a journey

Eventually a well-known authoress was selected and she set off after calmly saying 'goodbye' to the others.  She got back safely I am glad to say.  One would feel sorry to think of such a woman being shot.\u000aThere are about 70 girls imprisoned in Kilmainham Jail according to the press and about 30 in Mountjoy.  It is thought however that they will be all released immediately.\u000aI suppose the American papers have by this time the romantic marriage of Joseph Plunkett, son of Count Plunkett, who was shot by order of court martial.  He was engaged to be married to the daughter of a Dublin solicitor, a Miss Gifford.  She desired to be his bride, so they were married in prison the night before his Execution at midnight and he was shot the next morning.  She was bride and widow within the 24

So that the two sisters gave their all.\u000aI think you were present last year at O'Donovan Rossa's funeral when Pierce dlivered the funeral oration over his grave.  There were few more eloquent speakers than he.  How curiously apt are the words in which he wound up his speech, nowadays, 'The fools, the fools, do they seek to destroy our Nationality, while they leave us the graves of our dead'\u000aI suppose his own grave will now become an inspiration for Young Ireland ??the struggle goes on from generation to generation with passionate devotion and willing self sacrifice on the one side and ineptitude and stupidity and callous indifference on the other.

Immediately wrote the Cork Free Press and the Cork Examiner people and asked them to forward you the papers extending over the period of the rebellion which will give you all the news, if they reach you which is doubtful.  I have had acknowledgements from the newspaper people stating that they forwarded the newspapers in due course.  Ireland is under martial law at present and a strict censorship is kept on all letters, even letters from point to point in Ireland.

Pierce who was shot by sentence of court marshal, Sean McDermott who was also shot, Major John McBride, Ditto, The O'Rahilly who was killed in action at the Post Office, Thomas Clarke who was shot.  There were in all 15 shot by sentence of court marshal and about 100 sentenced to penal servitude.  Of the latter were Tom Ashe, Diarmuid Lynch, Fionan Lynch (Fr. John Lynch's brother of Killmakerin).  Ashe was sentenced to penal servitude for life and Lynch (Diarmuid) got 10 years.  He was I believe sentenced to be hanged but the American Authorities intervened and his sentence was commuted to 10 years.  Fionan Lynch got 10

Vyears also.  There are about 2000 transported to England awaiting trial including Arthur Griffith.  John McNeill has been tried and found guilty but has not been sentenced so far.  I think he is likely to get off lightly for at the last moment he issued an order to all his followers prohibiting them from taking part in parades or anything else on that day.  This order kept the country out of reach from Dublin, absolutely quiet and prevented the trouble from spreading.  We haven't got the rights or wrongs of the thing yet but it would appear that McNeill was against the rising and certainly his order prevented the Rebellion from being on a much larger scale.\u000aSean T O'C. is a prisoner awaiting trial and wounded I believe.  \u000aKerry kept very quiet during the business.  The volunteers in this County looked upon McNeill as their chief and they acted on his order.  That accounts

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aMichael Collins (1890-1922) served as aide-de-camp to Joseph Plunkett in the GPO during the Rising and was imprisoned in Frongach. He went on to become Minister for Finance in the First Dáil, IRA Director of Information and President of the Provisional Government.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written to Ryan from Frongach internment camp. Ryan had already been released and Collins fills him on changes in the camp and the conditions and morale of his fellow prisoners.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aMichael Collins (1890-1922) served as aide-de-camp to Joseph Plunkett in the GPO during the Rising and was imprisoned in Frongach. He went on to become Minister for Finance in the First Dáil, IRA Director of Information and President of the Provisional Government.\u000a\u000aThe letter is written from Frongach internment camp. Ryan had been imprisoned there with Collins but released early. Collins fills Ryan in on some of the happenings in the camp but mentions that many of his letters had 'meeting with accidents': they had not passed the censor's office. The letter also subtly refers to political organisation in the camp and tells Ryan to keep an eye on developments in Dublin Corporation.

Vwas wanted from 182 to take a party to Beskill - my luck was all out and I was the only officer in the battery who was not going on leave - the other two having gone out for a bike ride, so of course it fell to me - you can't imagine how disgusted I was - as I had promised to go.  \u000aYesterday morning I got up about 6.0 and started on the weary journey.  Five changes and I don't think even the D&S ER Shillelah branch could have taken 7 hours covering I suppose about 70 miles - but the South Eastern & Clapham did it all right - however in due we got to Beshill soon after 3.  The men voted for a train to Coodeu so we waited for one.  The trains are very diminutive and the first one that came was nearly full already, however after a little gymnastics, the forty-three men and myself packed on nearly leaving the conductress behind in the process.  By the time I had handed them over at Coodeu I found time had slipped by in a nasty way and it was well after 4.0 and the train gone.  I had a haversack at the SE and C station and my probable train left LB&SCR station at 4.31, the station was some two miles from

I talked to the conductor and we just got to Eastbourne in time for me to nip across into the Victoria train, a fast one non-stop arriving 6.40.  I had left a wire with the conductor giving instructions for wire from Miss Bauer to be forwarded to Victoria and on arrival found Mrs Temple couldn't have me for the night so went to Paddington.  I think Father only believed a small part of what I told him at Sussex Gardens, perhaps it will help to convince him when I say that a regulation is out

Vthat all officers up to rank of Major!! when registering in an hotel have to give their station and name of commanding officer!!!  Thank goodness at least a few people in Ireland know how to behave in public.  Having this sort of 'brand of the uniform' wherever one goes irritates me horribly.  I remarked at the hotel that it didn't say much for the army, with which sentiment they I think fully agreed - I had to leave a deposit at the Office, it's a wonder they didn't make me pay for the meals as I took them.\u000aAnyway I had a real grand slam dinner - I thought it would be my last for some time, so I went straight ahead.  9 courses I think there were.  I thought I'd be laid out in the morning but I wasn't so I had a small slam breakfast.  I quite expected that would do for me, but I'm still going strong (5.30).  I hope Mother won't be horrified.  I'm afraid I'm a regular German.

He was subsequently imprisoned in Frongach internment camp.\u000a\u000aIn the letter Dore asks Ryan, who had already been released from Frongach, about family and friends at home and also refers to some of his fellow prisoners.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter is from Mort O'Connell, who was imprisoned in Frongach with Ryan. Ryan had been released and the letter refers to the move to 'South Camp' and describes the weather. It also refers one of the prisoners whose wife had recently given birth and asks Ryan about events at home.

The parcel addressed to Mick arrived in good condition-it was a marvellous piece of workmanship. I expect you have seen the Frongoch Revelations in the Independent. You were lucky in being released before we shifted to the South Camp. The winter has set in & the weather is similar to that of the first fortnight in Camp last June-incessant rain & storm. It is a hum-drum life even as uninteresting as yours and ME in the "cauld north". Ned <unclear>Morkan</unclear> has now a <hi rend="underline">Young Rebel</hi> to emulate his exploits of Easter week. He is in the devils own form. Ned is like a youngster of ten. You out to write to him & &#x2014;\u000aAll the lads are in the best of form. It would take the devil himself to make us downhearted.

It is impossible to get anything in or out of present. The censorship is very strict. All tinned stuff is opened so you see the 'Irish Prisoners' are a danger to the Realm.

I went straight to Trinity College, and found a dozen or so others arguing with the porter, who would not budge from his orders to admit no one. Nor would he send a message to head-quarters at the front gate facing College Green, so we gave it up for the time and wandered about for a bit to see how things were looking. There were crowds of foot passengers quite orderly, and not in the least understanding the situation. Shots were being fired here and there, especially between Dublin Castle and the rebels in the Daily Express building just across the road, but the entire absence of any armed person in the streets produced a feeling of unreality, almost of deliberate drama, in the beholder. For instance, the huge breadth of Sackville Street at the G.P.O. was spanned by a strand or two of barbed wire, and one callow youth in the uniform of the Sinn Fein (pronounce 'Shin Fane') army was leaning on his rifle chatting to a knot of people while keeping the wire inviolate. The windows of the G.P.O. were smashed, mail-bags, office-furniture and miscellanean formed cover for the defenders, and some of these could be seen more or less at their ease

Vcheered them as they entered the gates. From that time the College was the scene of the greatest military activity, and at one period later in the week a whole brigade with cavalry and artillery billetted and bivouacked within the walls. The actual defence of the College was left in our hands and we had a strenuous ten days of manning windows and roofs and mounting guards. A machine gun and a party of sharp-shooters on the roof did good execution down Sackville Street, and T.C.D. may be said to have served the banks and business premises of the most important thoroughfare of Dublin. Only one shop within range of our rifles was looted and I shall never understand how the riff-raff of the streets could brave the hail of bullets-even though most of them were fired high-in order to steal boxes and sacks full of fruit and vegetables. \u000aThe College buildings are high and formed a perfect protection from the enemy's bullets, but it was not a pleasant experience to do guard duty in the various quads, while rifle and machine gun fire was going on briskly overhead, but I got used to it in a short time. I know now what a diet of bully beef and biscuits means, for we had them three times a day almost the whole time, very rarely seeing bread or butter, and meat of the uncanned variety only once. Even jam was scarce, and after the first two days there were no potatoes. That was nothing, but we all felt the need for sleep, as the garrison was not strong enough to permit a proper system of reliefs. For five nights I slept something

A machine gun and a party of sharp-shooters <lb/>on the roof did good execution down Sackville Street, and <lb/>T.C.D. may be said to have served the banks and business <lb/>premises of the most important thoroughfare of Dublin. Only <lb/>one shop within range of our rifles was looted and I shall never <lb/>understand how the riff-raff of the streets could brave the <lb/>hail of bullets - even though most of them were fired high - <lb/>in order to steal boxes and sacks full of fruit and vegetables. \u000aThe College buildings are high and formed a perfect <lb/>protection from the enemy's bullets, but it was not a pleasant <lb/>experience to do guard duty in the various quads, while rifle <lb/>and machine gun fire was going on briskly overhead, but I <lb/>got used to it in a short time. I know now what a diet <lb/>of bully beef and biscuits means, for we had them three times <lb/>a day almost the whole time, very rarely seeing bread or <lb/>butter, and meat of the uncanned variety only once. Even <lb/>jam was scarce, and after the first two days there were no <lb/>potatoes. That was nothing, but we all felt the want of <lb/>sleep, as the garrison was not strong enough to permit a <lb/>proper system of reliefs. For five nights I slept something\u000a\u000a4.

Vless than ten hours, and that of course with all clothes and equipment on. But what is that compared with one spell of duty in the driest trench at the front. If the rebels had possessed anything heavier than a machine gun we should have slept still less. \u000aThe madness of it all! But was the plan mere madness? I do not believe it. The rebels were convinced, in my opinion, that they were taking part in a great German push by sea and by land, and you will find that they had good reason for their belief. The rebels adopted defensive tactics from the beginning, and they gambled upon (a) a general rising of the populace, (b) German assistance arriving before the British could send enough men from England. They hoped that the German Navy, or the Submarine part of it, would deal with the transports, and that the paralysis of Dublin would be followed immediately by a relief occupation of every important town in the country. \u000aWe call them madmen now because they did not succeed, but we shall not know for a long time how mad they really were. \u000aIf it were not for the wanton burning of Sackville Street, the city and the country would have suffered no more than trifling inconvenience, and a few hundred casualties, but that immense act of arson has ruined Dublin for the time. I saw the fire, and it will never fade from my memory. No photographs can reproduce the awful devastation which it wrought, nor any

Vwriting the misery which it leaves behind. \u000aNevertheless, this rebellion has done one good thing in that the reality of war has been brought to our doors, and I shall have more hope for Ireland from now on. Perhaps if the rebellion had flared up in the provinces before it was suppressed, the ultimate result would be happier, but in the Dublin area at least the people will turn from the pleasure of making profits out of the war to the sterner task of fighting adversity. \u000aThere is still an O.T.C. garrison in T.C.D., but the business men are being relieved, and I gave up my rifle on Friday, after 9 days continuous duty. It is said that T.C.D. saved the city, and I am proud to have been one of the garrison. Luckily the long range shooting of the rebels was poor while ours was fair to good, so that we suffered no casualties.

They assured me that everything would be quiet in the morning, so I went home to bed, and cycled in early on Tuesday morning in mufti, riding quite unconscious of danger down one side of Stephens' Green, which was in the hands of the rebels.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising.

I was delighted when I learned, and through a casual remark in a letter of Kits' that you were free at last. I had almost begun to fear that you with Liam and Michael had been put on the blacklist and that you too were going to be an absentee from Tomcoole on the memorable 16th of August.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aSean T. O'Kelly (1882-1966) was a politician and later president of Ireland. He was arrested after the Rising and imprisoned first in Wandsworth the Woking, Frogach and Reading. O'Kelly married Ryan's sister Mary Kate (Kit in the letter) in 1918 and after her death he married another of Ryan's sisters, Phyllis.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written after Ryan's release from Frongach but while O'Kelly was still imprisoned and O'Kelly mentions some prisoners who now feel neglected by their friends. O'Kelly also refers to personal and family matters and speculates about the release of the rest of the 1916 prisoners.

Vaccount of things in his county.He was greatly pleased with the complimentary references to his prowess as a card player. I believe he fancies himself some in that line. It is one of his weak spots and he is quite ready to swallow any quantity of praise. You should hear Nicholls or P.J.D. on him when they are playing together. It is very rich sometimes. I should be interested to see a game between himself and yourself on opposite sides. I believe with all his notions of himself you'd clean out his pockets quickly. We were all glad to learn the West was as reliable.\u000aHave you decided on the HallowEne for the ?Rick? up at the Widow's. I think even I would be quite willing to be tormented by being pestered to sing by herself and Jane B. for a whole night now. In fact I believe I should enjoy the experience which so often made me swear bad. We have decided to arrange some kind of joint spread for that night too and I have had the cheek to ask the widow to send me on a cake for the occasion.\u000aI would not be surprised if some of the camp men were home before long.

He is greatly elated over it. He has £60 or £70 back pay to draw and intends doing himself well at the end of the month for a few days. You ought to ring him up and congratulate him. You should be well able to deputize for me in whatever is going! I believe his brother P.J. is marrying the Galway girl some time in January next.

Van entirely different position and <hi rend="underline">the</hi> my party were taken by the R.E. for a fatigue party to rejoin the battery in three weeks! There is terrible confusion and mess up out here, but I suppose in the end things gradually get done. The place where the battery is now is splendid. The other place where I went first is by no means ideal - an old battlefield of the French, utter desolation & plenty of legs & arms and bones and old boots & none too pure an atmosphere and digging in same place is by no means amusing. I went for a walk round the place with the Col General when I first arrived and he showed me a boat in which he said a short time ago a leg was sticking out a mark used as a sign post for pointing out the way. As for the village if one looks carefully in the grass one may find where the walls stood but in places it's not easy. Over here things are much better the village is more or less intact in fact some houses including the one we're in have roofs a very pleasant change after dirty dugouts. The food here is good and we're as comfortable as princes but everything is in awful confusion and muddle.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter welcomes Ryan back to Ireland after his release from Frongach and enquires about some of his colleagues who had also been imprisoned. Mairín also asks about Ryan's sister Phyllis who had recently taken an exam and fills him in on some other personal events.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written after Ryan had been released from Frongach. Ryan does not seem to have been able to get work in the same branch of a company as the writer but has secured other work. The letter refers to conscription to the British army, which was threatened in Ireland but never applied during the Great War, and the writer speculates that it will not be introduced. The letter also refers to friends and colleagues. The 'Mick' referred to is probably Michael Collins.

V18/10/16\u000aMy dear Jim,\u000aEven though you did take time to make up your mind, sure like the other story "Its better late than never" and ??? I suppose with all your other pressing engagement you find it difficult to fir sitting down to write letters. I hope the weather has improved some it is so unpleasant to have it raining. we are all doing fairly well, we have just repulsed a strong attack of the "Flu" which was made in great force on our position, we suffered some ???. I am glad to hear that you are working away and I am sure you will get used to the change, of course I am sorry we didn't have room for you in this branch, but the firm might start transferring again and sure one never knows their luck, I hope however that in the meantime you will make good and get over your Exams with flying colours. One does not take long to get over six months and the work at the rate of several hours a day will do you a world of good, and as for the staying power well if I am any sort of a judge I'll plump right on it. Yes we are still on the ?Huntball? racket and so long as the weather keeps fairly satisfactory we are

V??? to keep on it. I do not think that there is any likelihood of conscription bein enforced so I reckon things are alright out there. I often have a game of bridge ordinary bridge you know but that is the only card game we have, I must find out something of poker. I don't remember have ever played it. I am glad to hear of Jack McDonagh when you see him again give him my kindest regards and tell him I would like very much to hear from him. Ginger and C. are both quite well I enjoy the former immensely as his delight at being here is unbounded and his description of the place really wonderful, I am glad you hear from the other branch I hope George is quite well I hear Dick has not been having a very pleasant time but I suppose Mick gives you all the news. Give them all my kind remembrance when you write them.\u000aWell I reckon it's very little news I have but I am glad you wrote me, Kindest regards to all who may be enquiring and best wishes to yourself.\u000aYour Very ???

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aKathleen Teebay had come to know Ryan while he was imprisoned in Stafford detention camp and the letter was written after his release from Frongach and return to Ireland. In the letter she refers Mrs Figgis, wife of Darrell Figgis who was imprisoned in Reading after the Rising. Ryan had thanked her the help she had given to relatives visiting those imprisoned in Stafford after the Rising and response makes it is clear that she had some sympathy with the rebels.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aKathleen Teebay had come to know Ryan while he was imprisoned in Stafford, where she lived, and she became friendly with many of the other inmates. Ryan had been released from prison when the letter was written. Teebay refers to Miss Pearse and Mrs Pearse, sister and mother of Patrick Pearse (executed after the Rising) and notes that she was given a book that had belonged to Pearse from St. Enda's, Rathfarnham, the school he had founded. It also describes the wife of Darrell Figgis, arrested after the Rising, as a 'great agitator' and refers to others involved in the republican movement, including Michael Collins.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter writer is from Stafford, where Ryan spent some time in prison and the letter was written after his return to Ireland. It makes reference to the campaign to secure amnesty for the release of the remaining 1916 leaders. It also refers to the execution of Roger Casement who was arrested before the outbreak of the Rising and hanged in England in August 1916. Reference is made to a campaign in the press to 'blacken' Casement's name and the infamous 'Black Diaries' that were used in evidence against Casement at his trial.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written after Ryan's release from Frongach and refers to the prisoners who remained there. The writer sympathises with them as winter is coming and hopes they will be released when the British parliament resumes. The letter refers to others involved in the republican movement and mentions trips to Dublin.

VSean MacDiarmuida (1883-1916) was one of the key organisers of the Easter Rising. He signed the Proclamation of the Irish Republic and was executed in May 1916.\u000a\u000aThe letter wishes Mairín a happy christmas season and apologises for being unable to meet her. Mairín is probably Mairín Cregan, a prolific Irish children's writer who married James Ryan in 1919: the letter survives in Ryan's personal papers.\u000a\u000aThe letter is sent from the office of the newspaper 'Nationality', an organ of the Irish Republican Brotherhood. MacDiarmuida was the manager and registered owner of the newspaper.

VAustin Stack (1879-1929) was leader of the Tralee Irish Volunteers and was tasked with the distribution of German arms that were due to land in Fenit for use in the Rising. When the landing failed, Stack was arrested. He was imprisoned and released a year later. He was elected an MP in 1918, became Dáil Minister for Home Affairs in 1919 and was a prominent opponent of the Anglo-Treaty.\u000a\u000aThe letter was probably sent to Maureen (Mairín) Cregan, a prolific Irish children's writer who married James Ryan: the letter survives in Ryan's papers.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written from Kilmainham Gaol before Stack was sent to prison in the United Kingdom. In the letter he speculates that he will get a long sentences as the Chief Crown Solicitor claimed he should have been executed ('backed the wall'). He complains about the use of evidence during the courts martial and hopes that Michael Collins, who had a minor role in the Rising, would get a lenient sentence, describing him as 'an unfortunate victim to circumstances'.

VKilmainham Gaol\u000a18th June 1916\u000a\u000aMy dear Maureen,\u000aI am sure you will not be able to see us again before we are sent away. I do not know what sentences we may receive but I am prepared for a long term as the Chief Crown Solicitor told Dr. O'Connell on Friday night that I should have "backed the wall". They failed to make out any case against us but what do the court-martial care about such trifles as legal evidence when the authorities want people out of the way?\u000aI hope Collins gets off light as he was an unfortunate victim to circumstances. He, at any rate, should have been acquitted.\u000aBut we shall survive it all with God's help, and meet our friends again.\u000aGoodbye, brave little woman, and say an occasional prayer for \u000aIreland's unworthy son\u000aAustin Stack

VLetter to the under secretary at Dublin Castle ( Sir Matthew Nathan) with regards to the vacancy of Deputy Lieutenant for Deputy following the death of Captain Charles M. Celthurst Vesey from Reginald Le Normand Brabazon, 13th Earl of Meath, Lord Lieutenant of County Dublin. Meath had originally proposed  Viscount Powerscourt for the position (NAI_CSO/RP/1916/3644/15). However this was rejected by Nathan due to the fact that Powerscourt was already Lieutenant for Wicklow. Meath now proposes Mr. William T. Stewart of Killymoon, Donnybrook, Co. Dublin for the position.

There appears to be no precedent for the appointment of an existing Lieutenant of a County to be a Deputy Lieutenant of another County.\u000aWhen a gentleman who holds a Commission as a Deputy Lieutenant has been proposed for appointment as a Deputy Lieutenant in another County it has been the rule to require him to resign his existing Commission before approving of the appointment. The number of Deputy Lieutenants in each County being limited, the holding of two Commissions by the same gentleman prevents the appointment of another gentleman who may be duly qualified. It would appear to His Excellency that similar considerations would apply to the proposed appointment of a Lieutenant of another County<del>and His Excellency would therefore</del> & in these circs I would be glad if <del>Your Lordship will be so good as</del> you could see your way to reconsider your recommendation\u000aas\u000aThe Right Honourable,\u000aThe Earl of Meath, K.P.,\u000aChamworth House, \u000aOttershaw,\u000aChertsey.

The Lord Lieutenant has directed the writer to enclose a list of the deputy lieutenants for Co Antrim and to state that there appear to be only two vacancies available, not four as suggested by the Earl. He also points out that Major Roger Casement is already an deputy lieutenant for Co Wicklow and that it is not usual for gentlemen to be D.L.s for two counties.

VTelephone 2094\u000aVice Regal Lodge, Dublin\u000a28th February, 1916\u000a\u000aDear Sir Matthew,\u000aWith reference to my letter of last night, I made some further enquiries. It seems that in addition to my telegram to Maitland from London, His Excellency wrote to him himself, and that in consequence he was particularly alive to the necessity of sending press cuttings daily. He found they did not arrive daily, and twice telephoned on the subject to the Registrar before he communicated with Sir Edward O'Farrell. The envelope I referred to yesterday was the third instance of an accumulation of cuttings arriving by the same post. That five or six days cuttings arrived together is quite evidently an exaggeration. The fact that each days cuttings are in two batches, recruiting and ordinary, gives the appearance of greater accumulation than is really the case.\u000a\u000aYours sincerely,\u000aBasil Blackwood

V52 Lower Mount Street,\u000aJany 18th 1916\u000a\u000aMy dearest Muddie, \u000aI thought the boy was a little limp this morning which I expect was really perhaps the result of his first sitting up yesterday. However he cheered up in the afternoon and was most exuberant this evening. He is getting awfully rampant but I was glad that the sister firmly vetoed his being up longer, for I am sure though he does feel it at the moment that he is better not allowed to do all he wants to. I think he has rather the upper hand of Nurse Bow (if that's how she spells her name!). He is frightfully <sic>agrieved</sic> at tapioca pudding for luncheon but had a very nice dinner, soup, fish + cream pudding, much enjoyed. We had a turn of power patience in the afternoon varied by a dissertation on numerals + numerical systems, <sic>Abyssinnian</sic>  methods of multiplication, a <gap/> electrical problem. I did not see any of the attendants

One keeps thinking of poor little Hilda + wondering how things go with her. I am so glad she has the little son at any rate. I think the change of air has nearly quite taken away the remains of my pain which is very satisfactory. I asked for the vermin powder today but could not get it. I should think its best to write to Bob direct to get it. By the by have you tipped Mary huge? Or will it be right if I give her 2/6? She and Wm Turner are very fine + engaging + thoughtful + certainly make one feel very comfortable. Ever so much love Mother dearest. I hope Father's hand is all right by now.

VThis is a letter sent from Wakefield prison on 23 May 1916 to Jim's wife Nora (née Crothers). Jim indicates in the letter that he had nothing to do with the events of 1916. Online resources list him as having being arrested in connection with events at Ballsbridge and sent to Wakefield on 6 May 1916. The references therein are to his children, Annie, Bob and Jim. Annie Tyrrell subsequently married Denis Fennell from Dublin.

I had passed a large part of the afternoon in an officers hairdressing place - quite decent.

It was fortunately a beautiful day and I could almost have imagined I was somewhere in the South of England say Sussex - the place is all chalk. Monday it rained steadily and I had my first small taste of mud ?needly? to say order came for several batteries near to move, and that night it was awful. The battery I was messing with went and <gap/> just after I went to bed - I had to get up to take over some ammunition they had to leave behind. They were working hard till five a.m before they got away.\u000aNow things won't be so comfortable for me - though certainly I've nothing to complain of, and I shall be able to settle myself comfortably into one of their Officers dugouts.\u000aThis morning it was still raining fine but steady - I got the order to go and

VEamonn O'Modhráin, or Edward Moran, was taken prisoner by the British authorities soon after the 1916 Rising. He was one of the commanders of the Irish Volunteers in County Kildare and a founder member of the Gaelic League and Sinn Fein in Newbridge. We are still unclear if he actually fought during the Rising. What we do know is that he received one of the hand-written letters from Eoin MacNeill countermanding the order commence military activities during that weekend. We also have anecdotal evidence that he, in turn, verbally conveyed this order to those under his command in the South Kildare region.

C. has sundry things he wants to do & must go to see Dr. Ball, so we decided it was better to wait till Friday. I all avocations are done we should hope to go down by the 10.10 train, but I think it is quite possible we may not get off till the 4.30. I shall know better tomorrow. C. has carte blanche

C. & I had a very good tea together & he then discovered a delightful occupation i.e. decorating the glass burners of the electric stove with ribald drawings which kept him very happy all the evening. All his dressings have been taken off the wound which makes him much more comfortable but he still complains of being "tied up in a ????" from it, but the Dr. & nurses are not at all sympathetic as to that..

VThe letter is a handwritten copy of a letter originally sent from Charles Wyndham Wynne (1895-1917) to his mother, Alice Wynne (d. 1928). Charles was an officer in the British army and was on active service at the time he wrote the letter.\u000a\u000aHe describes his daily life and gives a detailed account of the preparations for a battery (a fortifed placement to fire heavy guns) to attack German positions, which he hopes will happen soon. Though it is quiet when he writes, he refers to the trenches and graves left behind after a previous attack.\u000a\u000aCharles was killed in action in June 1917.

V9.x.16\u000aDear Mother,\u000aI have had another stroke of rotten luck, and am cursing hard, however that doesn't do much good so I try to make the best of civilisation while it lasts.\u000aWhat joy when the battery brought along a grand budget of letters. I almost stuck them in my pocket to prolong the anticipation.\u000aI got yours of 25th, 30th, & 1st with Win's enclosure and Em's of the 2nd - very many thanks to all - you hardly know the joy of letters, Mother, its simply grand.\u000aWell I must say the way they've treated us here has disgusted me and thoroughly enraged the Captain! I suppose we'll soon get accustomed to their ways. As you know I went forward with the advance party - my duties being presumably to get ready the battery posn.  find out all there was to know - and generally make things smooth for the battery to come in. I think <del>we</del>my last letter brought me up to where we got to the battery posn. - we got there on Sunday and when I got there I found <gap/>all the officers of a battery section just by our posn. were going out for the afternoon and I had

In the afternoon orders came through to open fire on a certain tramway but just as we started the mist came down so that the fall of the rounds couldn't be observed - wasn't it rotten luck - we only fired five. Sunday and Monday we were working hard on our posn. and really got it quite nice. On Sunday afternoon the other battery - with whom by the way I was  Messing got orders to move that night - awful commotion - and of course, heavy rain - between twelve & 1 o'cl I was called out of bed and had to shove something over my pyjamas while I went down & took over some ammunition which owing to some muddle they couldn't take!\u000aNext morning we got orders to go and cover the tracks of another battery that had moved out that night - it was raining steadily, and a beastly job - but we made a regular work of art of it.\u000aNext day we again started on our own posn. where in the afternoon I got information that the battery was really going to another posn. altogether right the other side of the ridge!! We had to wait that night to load

Well when we had finished off the shell we started to walk back - I had a telephone & waterproof etc. - on the way a wasp got caught behind my glasses and the telephone went about twenty yards in one direction and the mac in another and my cap in another and with a roar I landed in a most undignified posn. in the mud - fortunately the wasp only got me in the eyelid which wasn't very bad - anyway, when we got up I found that that evening we had to go back again to new billets quite near the old place.

VWesley Fletcher Hanna was one of fourteen children of Robert and Emily Hanna. Hanna, a Methodist, worked as an accountant for Switzers in Limerick.\u000a\u000aThe letter is written for his family in Limerick, and a sister, Frances, in Montevideo, Uruguay. The letter was passed around members of the family and Hanna included the instruction to 'pass round quickly please'. 'Emma' is Emma Charlotte (1864-1933), the eldest of the siblings,'R.A.' Is Robert Allen (Bertie), (1871-1947), the second eldest boy. 'Merrie' was Miriam Eunice (1888-1968), 'Mona' was Alison Moeran (1885-1933),\u000a\u000aFrances was Frances Madeline (1876-1959), 'FAH' is Francis Asbury (1880-1967), another brother. \u000a\u000aIt describes events witnessed by Hanna in Dublin from 8.30pm on Tuesday, 27 April 1916, when he arrived in Dublin from Limerick, and the following Sunday, 2 July (3 July is written on the letter). The Easter Rising had broken out in Dublin the day before Hanna's arrival. \u000a\u000aThe letter is representative of much of the confusion and gossip circulatin

The train came in at the arrival platform which made us very suspicious but we little knew what was to come. Outside all darkness - no trams or cars of any description of course and no one to give any information as to what was going on anywhere - about 700 or so got out of our train, some for cross channel most for Dublin so we looked round in wonderment - Quay  at Guinness's side held by fixed bayonets - the Kingsbridge ditto but they let us pass one way. I thought I might get a corner in Ross's but it was crammed to the doors, not even a chair left - so I slung in my bag and asked Mr R to keep it until I could send for it.

All this while I haven't said anything of the beginning because I don't know it. The Liberty Hall (Larkin's men) appear to have seized the G.P.O. first of all and the other points were quickly seized by S.F. Well to continue - we went to rest, rifle fire still going on and some heavy gunfire also. Wednesday morning - no telephones available, no train back home for the day so I fortunately collared a Rly porter and scribbled a note to Mr Wilson to ask him to get his Limerick folk to communicate with you and stop Mona coming up for a while - I, of course, don't know whether this has gone through or not! As I was parleying with this porter up came one of Switzers girls who was pretty well upset thro inability to get home since the night before. Had left Midleton 2.30 on Monday and got as far as the Junction same day. Then turned back to Cork again and spent the night in a Rly carriage. Came up on

Finally, in desperation, she with 5 others had entreated a housekeeper to give them if only a covering for the night and were brought in and given supper, beds - 3 on the floor - (they slept in their clothes) and breakfast. When I met her she was absolutely "at sea", so I proposed that if she liked to try in my company we would endeavour to get round the city and so we started on a 6 mile walk - eventually landing at her door at 1pm. to her great delight and undisguised relief. Then I sailed on to Mrs Nelson's and gave her all the Limerick news. She was in a very nervous state as you might expect but seemed much relieved that no trouble had arisen in Limerick or Cork as both places were reported as very much disturbed indeed. At 2.30 I restarted my journey homeward taking my usual route - Bless you! soldiers hundreds of them on the march from Kingstown along Morehampton

Then I went on through Herbert Park where I stopped for a word or two with Mrs Fannin - then on again to find Ballsbridge held by the military and a fairly smart fusillade in progress - 4 soldiers shot dead there during the morning! So I had to turn again and go out through Donnybrook and along by the Dodder and so home without any mishap at 4.30! much to Mrs Richard's surprise. \u000a\u000aI had a good wash, some tea and then strolled out to Mr Moore's place to ask about business [ engagements? ]. Stayed there about 1 1/2 hours and then home. \u000a\u000aSteady firing going on all the time - This morning more military in from Kingstown - full brigade all departments.

The trouble is I don't know where to begin! Firing is going on constantly all the time - up to tonight we have had none near us but tonight! Some S.F. chap had got into the second house in the avenue up near the tramlines you know, and fired at a soldier wounding him. Then the fun (?) began and the place was alive with the firing all round for quite 10 minutes - then the end - they got him dead! Really it is awful to think of! About half an hour or so after that there was some desultory  firing and smack came a bullet against next door house. I skipped you

Well on the Saturday previously Sir Roger Casement was captured in Ireland  - taken to London and shot on the Sunday. This precipitated matters and Limerick and Cork were to have "gone out" also. Plans miscarried somewhat and Limerick and Cork did not - or at least not up to Wednesday to take the "official report" here as true. The other leaders here who are accounted for are Sheehy Skeffington taken and shot - O'Farrell J.C.

The hospitals are declining S.F. wounded I hear but I hardly credit it. Hospitals don't discriminate that way although it seems hard to have to take in those who caused all the sorrow and loss - but humanity is only humanity after all. Yesterday I spent cycling with a chum out to the mountains with field glasses to see if we could distinguish the damaged area. The City was very hazy and we could see very little that was of use to us. It was a glorious day and it was good to be away from the row

Then last night - or rather this morning - there was tremendous shooting round about us and I heard this morning that the military were searching the gardens round about here. This afternoon they started "Shelling" a house in the avenue.

It refers to the fighting in Dublin, including at St Stephen's Green and the Royal College of Surgeons, and the destruction of Sackville Street (now O'Connell Street). The impact of the Rising on the civilian population is alluded to in the letter. Hilda describes how they had 'lost 2 parishioners' who had been defending Beggars Bush barracks, refers to the looting that took place in the city during the Rising and the difficulties of getting in to the city centre after Easter week as trams were still not running.\u000a\u000aThe letter was sent via Holyhead as it was feared it would be lost if sent straight from Dublin.

Vbrooch for Nano. The most of their stuff has gone in the week but they will be able to let me see a selection of bangles on Monday. \u000aAs to the brooch, I was thinking of getting Nano something on the Tara brooch style but I\u2019m afraid they are not to be obtained hardly in Dublin now. Hopkins were practically the only makers and all their stocks of such brooches and also the dies for making them have I hear been destroyed. I\u2019ll see what I can do however but perhaps she would prefer some other design. Let me know on that point by Monday if possible. If she likes stones, let me know the colour etc. As regards yourself do you prefer a chain bracelet bangle or a solid bracelet? If the former is it a curb chain or a fancy chain? I suggest the fancy chain as the curb chain is a bit common I think. If you prefer a solid bracelet would you like it with stones and if so what colour? Hope the dress is getting on well and will turn out as big a success as the wearer. I fancy I can see my dear dear girl looking a picture in it and I long to kiss her sweet face. I hope that God will bless us both. I hope you are praying for me because I need it so badly. I have no other news at all so will say goodbye with warmest and most devoted love\u000aYour ever loving \u000aJames

V30th May 1916\u000aMy dearest May\u000aI was very much disappointed at not receiving a letter today as I was anxious to settle the matter of the bangle and also the even more important matter  if the wedding ring. I was looking at a few specimens of the latter at Hopkin\u2019s temporary place  yesterday: they have succeeded in saving a few from the fire and I rather liked one which was rather thick and heavy and generally massive looking. I\u2019m not sure whether you might not like a ring somewhat less imposing and if you do of course your wish is law. But I want to know the size anyway and if you haven\u2019t written by today will you please drop me a line tomorrow when you get this. \u000aWe had Father Willie Moran up to see us yesterday and he stayed last night.

I Think I will leave it to your taste I liked your taste in the watch & as well you have the advantage of having seen both the ring and the finger I dare say unless you have a great eye & memory altogether you forget my ring finger is fat and short I got my first present yesterday from Mrs Keernan. A Silver Tea pot I hope you will get something nice for yourself\u000aWe did not see the Cork Examiner and Jennie always sends it to us when there is anything in it she must not have got it but I will ask her. I heard that Bulfin  was in the GPO & in uniform so he cannot get off so easy I have no more news so good-bye.

VThe letter is a love letter from May to her fiancée James (d. 1922). In the letter, May promises to give James a present for being 'good' and writing often. She also refers to a broach or bracelet, a gift, and sizing her wedding ring. She discusses a neighbour, Josie Casey, and mentions that she is going for a wedding dress fitting.\u000a\u000aThe letter finishes with a reference to a man talking about the French being beaten at Verdun: the letter was written while the Battle of Verdun was still underway between German and French troops, but it did not end until December 1916.

I am going to Mullingar tomorrow to see about dress I\u2019ll see about car for you how long would you want it for would it take the day what time would we want to leave this about?\u000aJohnnie heard nothing since. Gerald heard talking of the French being beaten at Verdun, he was afterwards seen trespassing in the hall with a dirty spade, when he was asked where he was bound for he said to bury the Allies. A big undertaking.\u000aI don\u2019t think I have any news so I\u2019ll finish with warmest love & wishes\u000afrom your loving May

I received the copy of Pearce\u2019s letter quite safely and am glad you were not so foolish as to think I didn\u2019t send it because I thought you incapable of understanding it. I sent it to you as a human document and not as a political one and I know very well that in anything where genuine sentiment and capacity for self-sacrifice are concerned you are a much better and appreciative judge than I am. Apart from that I am quite aware that you have at least your share of brains (to say the least of it) and I am not such a supercilious \u201chigh \u2013 brow\u201d as to imagine that in that respect I am at all superior to you. The real reason why I didn\u2019t send the letter sooner is that I had only the one copy, I was too lazy to copy it and I wanted to show it to one or two people before

I expect Pat Moran tomorrow and if he doesn\u2019t turn up I shall avail of your services. It\u2019s very nice to have a little wife willing to do jobs for one.

Mrs Seery was called over to Balrath last night, the boss there was at death\u2019s door with drink but is slowly recovering Mrs Kiernan had got word from Gertie Duffy saying if she went to Dublin with her to see the Doctors she would pay her expenses for one day. I believe she is very delicate (Gertie) but does not think it, like every one of her said complaint, people all pity John- the take in he got- but I think one is as much to be pitied as the other\u000aI am returning the ring card size T is my size About your present I will look at some things in

The whole cause of the general bad humour was a letter Johnnie had got saying that firm was not going to be opened for the present & they therefore did not require him it was hard of course after such long wait for both parties but I can\u2019t understand them showing temper to Christy that would give them the house from over his head.\u000aI am sure tho\u2019 like ourselves ye will be disappointed for Johnnies job,\u000aI have no more news now dearest James I hope you will get to make out this, I would not be half as mad if it were myself it was done because I have \u201cgift of the gab\u201d\u000awarmest love from your loving\u000aMay

V1 June 1916\u000aMy dearest love\u000aYou\u2019ll have to let me off with a very short note today as I am awfully rushed and have been all day, partly business and partly arrangements for coming events. Glad you fixed up the motor for me and am much obliged for your good offices in the matter. About the ring, I think what I have selected will be all right and I don\u2019t think it will look too imposing. In any

Vcase you\u2019re worthy of the best I can get for you. The time you suggest will of course suit me that is 9:30 new time but remember we shall have to catch train at Portarlington at 4 o\u2019clock new time and I presume will have to leave Togherstown about 2 pm. That will however give us plenty of time I think. \u000aTourist arrangements in the South are all off I\u2019m afraid so we must try and manage as best we can by car as the motor coaches will not be running until 1st July. We will make for Glengarriff anyhow and chance our arm from there as to getting on to Killarney by the coast route. I haven\u2019t time to write any more now although I could spend a few more minutes anyhow telling you how I love you. Do you need me to do that though? I hope that by now you know me enough to feel sure of my sentiments in that respect anyhow. Don\u2019t forget ring card this evening.\u000aI send you my warmest love and kisses, my dear dear May\u000aYour loving\u000aJames \u000aShall go to Holy Communion on Sunday as

It was drawn in an autograph book belonging to a Nurse Kelly who was working there at that time. The sketch shows a nurse taking a patients temperature and expressing her concerns to a colleague. The caption reads:\u000a\u000a"This patient's temperature is 108! What shall I do?"\u000a\u000a" Put him down (as) a 100. The doctor gets so nervous if it is more" \u000a\u000aIt is signed:  Noel D Lemass  rebel  Dublin Castle Hospital May 1916.

VThe letter is from John Holland, a former overseer in the post office in Limerick, to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Sir Ivor Churchill Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne (1873-1939), lord lieutenant of Ireland. Holland complains that he has been reduced in rank and salary for 'telling an untruth' and 'disloyalty to another officer'. He states that the first accusation was untrue and the second was the result of his having reported on a colleague who had failed to despatch mailbags. Holland lists his strong links to the army, including a son who was invalided fighting in Flanders, and points out that others in the post office had failed to respond to the war effort. He believes the action was part of 'a concerted effort to ruin his prospects' in favour of a supporter of Sinn Féin and asks that the action be reversed.

VThis letter is from the Under Secretary of State for the Home Office in London to Sir Matthew Nathan, under-secretary for Ireland. The letter encloses a copy of a letter sent from the Home Office to Professor B.J. Collingwood regarding an application he had made to be allowed to transfer a license giving him permission to conduct experiments on living animals in Ireland. It points out that a previous letter to Collingwood had contained incorrect information and was forwarded in error. Notes regarding actions to be taken are handwritten at the bottom of the letter.\u000a\u000aThe enclosed letter informs Collingwood that his license cannot be transferred and that he should procure fresh certificates for Ireland, submit them to the Irish Government and return his old licenses to be cancelled.

I have and will give my employees every facility and encouragement to join, and sometimes I get loudly abused by their parents, I don't mind as my heart and soul are with the Allies and were I not the proprietor of this establishment and running a large business I would willingly offer my services altho nearly 60 years of age. If your Excellency could see your way to appoint me as a magistrate for the Borough of Waterford then I do believe a much larger field would be open to use for assisting a cause I have so much at heart. I remain your Excellency's humble servant, John Butler.

VThe letter is from Sir Henry Robinson (1857-1927), Vice-President of the Local Government Board, to Sir Matthew Nathan (1862-1939), Under Secretary for Ireland. The letter refers to a dispute in Kilrush, County Clare, over a toll levied by the urban district council on all turf brought in to the town market. Opposition to the toll had meant that turf was not being brought in to the town. Robinson argues that the toll was a fair one as the poor rate (a form of tax) was as high as it could go and the toll was needed for the council to fund its services. He believes the council should hold firm and keep the tax and expresses disappointment that the police had called for its withdrawal.\u000a\u000aEnclosed is a petition from the Chairman of Kilrush Urban Council and its solicitor to Major General Friend, Commander in Cheif of the Forces in Ireland, outlining their grievances. They describe agitation and intimidation by a small group of farmers that has prevented turf entering the town and suggests means of overcoming the o

VLocal Government Board, Dublin\u000a6th January 1916.\u000a\u000aMy dear Nathan,\u000aThe rates in Kilrush have approached the breaking point. They are 9/9 in the £, and even with this crushing impost the town is in debt. Their method of meeting their liabilities by a slight increase in the tolls is, in my judgement, a fair and proper one. All these farmers living outside the town use the roads for their carts going to markets, use the churches, the schools and the railway station, and make their living by their trade with the town while they do not contribute one penny towards the upkeep and maintenance of it. The only way they can be made to contribute to the benefits which they enjoy is by means of these small tolls which are no higher than those which exist in many parts of Ireland.\u000aThe Council gave due notice of their intention to make these tolls and no objection was raised. If there had been we should have made inquiry before we sanctioned them.\u000aI sincerely hope the Council will stand to their guns. This agitation will not last very long, and if the outside farmers succeed in forcing the Council now to give way, it will be the first to a strike against other tolls and this will only mean a still greater burden upon the townspeople, rich and poor.

VI do not think you are necessarily right in considering that the tolls are paid by the poorer purchasers. The people will probably have to pay their tolls on the turf that is exposed for sale before they sell it.\u000aI do not believe they will be able to get more than the present market price from the purchasers, at least for any length of time.\u000aThe matter is one for the Urban District Council, representing the towns people, and the outside farmers to fight out among themselves, and I sincerely hope the Council will win. I much regret to see that Police are expressing the opinion that the Council ought to withdraw the tax, and I hope they will be asked to keep this opinion to themselves.\u000aYours sincerely,\u000aH O Robinson\u000a\u000aThe Right Hon. Sir Matthew Nathan, G.C.M.G.,\u000aUnder Secretary,\u000aDublin Castle.

Lately an Agitation has sprung up among the Vendors of Turf from Sragh and the neighbourhood against a small Toll of 1d levied on Turf brought into the Kilrush Market the result being that though attempts have been made by the undersigned to procure waggons of Turf from the neighbourhood  of Sragh and Doonbeg still it has not been possible to get people in the neighbourhood to supply same owing to the intimidation of a few parties who are at the back of the Agitation. \u000aIn the circumstances the small farmers from the Sragh District have combined to prevent parties bringing Turf in on their Cars or supplying waggons through the Railway Company and the result is that the supply of Turf to Kilrush is cut off and the poor people are suffering as a result as they could not burn <del>turf</del> coal in the open hearths.\u000aThere are two ways of dealing with this kind of conduct. The first suggestion is that the Military Authorities should Commandeer a supply of turf which is always available at Sragh or Doonbeg on the W.C.R. and sell same to a Fuel Committee in Kilrush who would in turn sell it to the poor people or secondly without commandeering the turf at all if the Military Authorities used their influence with the Department of Agriculture for Ireland who own the Kilrush Demesne to allow the poor people to take away the old timber of which there is an abundance, this with a small supply of Coal which the Fuel Committee would provide would carry the people over the worst part of the winter.\u000ap.t.o.

VThe letter is a complaint from James Neazor, a retired excise officer in Limerick, to Augustine Birrell (1850-1933), Chief Secretary for Ireland. Neazor writes that he had been improperly held in the local lunatic asylum for over six years. He had been repeatedly 'slandered', he says, by Roman Catholic priests while he worked as an excise officer and after he had retired. Eventually a 'conspiracy' by the priests and a local doctor led to him being declared 'insane' and committed. The doctor continued to write reports that Neazor was insane as, Neazor claims, he was happy to keep receiving payment for keeping him. Neazor criticises the doctor and the asylum system in detail for allowing this to happen and asks Birrell to conduct an enquiry.

VLetter from A.C.C. Fraser, received in the office of the chief secretary of Ireland. Fraser was a member of the 9th (Scottish) Divsions 'Divisional Train' and part of the British Expeditionary Force, originally sent to France at the outbreak of the war in 1914. The Divisional Train was responsible for transporting supplies and soldiers. He requests the results of the examination for cadetship in the Royal Irish Constabulary, the police force for the island of Ireland (excluding Dublin city), as he intended to gain a commission as an officer and felt it would be advantageous to his application.

VLetter from Thomas W. Delaney, Crown Solicitor for Co. Longford to Sir Matthew Nathan, the Under secretary, about a case of false representation to secure a separation allowance.  It explains that at the Petty Sessions at Edgeworthstown on Thursday 6th April 1916, the accused, Maggie Kiernan, was fined ten shillings and costs for falsely stating that she was separated.  The magistrates presiding were the resident magistrate, Mr Jephson, Conel O'Farrel, J. Dowler and J. Redsham.  As this was the first such case, the magistrates imposed a small fine of ten shillings.  So far the case had not been publicised in the newspapers.

VOne of a collection of letters which Denis O' Driscoll (d. 1920) wrote to his daughters Elizabeth (Bessie) and Susanna (Sue) who had earlier emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts. He writes about family news and letters from two of his sons who are on active service in the British army. He gives a detailed account of the activity of submarines in the Atlantic during the war and a passenger liner that was torpedoed by a German submarine. He also refers to the possibility of conscription and what it would mean.\u000a\u000aEnclosed is a picture of Denis O'Driscoll.

In the first place your letter found us in our usual good health at home and as there is no change whatever in our circumstances I need not further refer to matters in that direction. I had a letter from Finneen on 27th ulto. when he was well. I was under the impression that I had forwarded his letter to you, but I have no record of it. I forwarded to you on 21st ulto. Gerald's letter of the 16th and on the 2nd inst. a later one to Sue, but I fancy it must have been Finnies, and not Geralds that I sent to Sue. However both were then well, and I am expecting a letter from Finneen by every post. He has always been most punctual in his letters to me, and when an unusual length of time passes without my my hearing from him I become very anxious. Finnie is in by far the greatest part of danger and privation, and hence my anxiety for his safety is greater than for that of Gerald on account of his very exposed position.

This was not through any respect for International law, or any other law which governs the conditions of honourable warfare, but because the British sunk them wherever they dared to show a periscope and the Germans finding their submarine fleet thinned out to such an extent that they had few left, saw that the game was not worth the candle and so desisted in order to save the remainder of their fleet. But though the Germans forsook the British waters in despair they found fresh work for their submarines in renewed activities in the Mediterranean, as witness the inhuman action of sinking by torpedoes the Italian passenger vessel "Ancona" on the 8th Inst off Sardinia, and this vessel was outward bound from Naples to New York. Her passengers consisted largely of women and children, and according to the latest accounts to hand there were 20 American citizens lost. This will give a fair idea to anybody who wishes to judge fairly what credit may be placed in the word of the German Emperor who has so shamefully violated the undertaking so recently given to President Wilson. The German Ambassador to the U.S. will give plausible excuses to the U.S. with his tongue in his cheek because he knows the U.S. is not in a position to resent the insult with dignity or effect but this is beside the subject of my letter. I have digressed and I resume. Perhaps the most despicable part of this treacherous act was that the German submarine flew the Austrian Flag because Germany is not at war with Italy but Austria is. Taking the circumstances into consideration as truthfully given by me in this letter I think you may venture but there is no doubt whatever my dear Bessie that there is a risk. Now with regard to Conscription, I believe it will come. The end of this month will decide that point When this war commenced, neither Great Britain nor any other country looked forward to such a severe strain upon the nations engaged in this war, and Great Britain evidently thought she could get all the men she wanted by volunteers. But since that time Turkey and Bulgaria have thrown in their lot with the Central powers, and Greece and Rumania while yet standing aloof, are shrewdly suspected of favouring the Central powers, and thus the Allies have need of all the men they can possibly get. A Ministry of Recruiting has been established in in England with Lord Derby at its head, and every kind of inducement and persuasion are held forth to men of military age to join the Colours; and if a sufficient number do not volunteer, then conscription will certainly come. Perhaps you may not clearly understand what this conscription means. It means that all men of military age that is to say between the age of 19 and 45 years are to be called to join the Colours and go to battle; but they have first about 6 months training - spartan training - before they would be of much use in the battle line. In this conscript, the first call will be on unmarried men, and all of this class must be exhausted before there is any call on the married men. There are exceptions suppose a married man volunteers he will of course be accepted, but Conscription means compulsion, and I believe Bessie that compulsion is bound eventually to come. Your next query is with regard to Ireland and what is likely to be her position after the war. The consideration of that is a very fascinating one, and I shall reply to you at length, but to do so now would mean my missing this post, and I musnt do that Meantime give my love, and that of all mine to Uncle Will and Aunt Barbara, and with the love of Mamma and Bab, I remain as ever fondly\u000a\u000a                                                           Your father\u000a\u000a                                                                              Denis O'Driscoll

Finnie is in by far the greatest part of danger and privation, and hence my anxiety for his safety is greater than for that of Gerald on account of his very exposed position.\u000a\u000aMollie comes to see us on and off. She came last evening looking remarkably well and apparently well contented. There has been some slight sickness in her place which throws more work on her hands but she looked very well notwithstanding.\u000a\u000aI received Sue's parcel all safe and with much gratitude, and I wrote acknowledging receipt on the day of its arrival - Oct. 26. so that Sue should have received my letter in the ordinary course of post. \u000aWith regard to the safety or otherwise of venturing across the Atlantic at present it is very difficult to form a reliable opinion. As matters stand just now, and as they have stood for the past couple of months it would be safe enough. You may have noticed for a considerable time past, the activities of the German submarines have come to almost a standstill in the North Seand and English Channel and the Irish Sea. This was not through any respect for International law, or any other law which governs the conditions of honourable warfare, but because the British sunk them wherever they dared to show a periscope and the Germans finding their submarine fleet thinned out to such an extent that they had few left, saw that the game was not worth the candle and so desisted in order to save the remainder of their fleet. But though the Germans forsook the British waters in despair they found fresh work for their submarines in renewed activities in the Mediterranean, as witness the inhuman action of sinking by torpedoes the Italian passenger vessel "Ancona" on the 8th Inst off Sardinia, and this vessel was outward bound from Naples to New York. Her passengers consisted largely of women and children, and according to the latest accounts to hand there were 20 American citizens lost. This will give a fair idea to anybody who wishes to judge fairly what credit may be placed in the word of the German Emperor who has so shamefully violated the undertaking so recently given to President Wilson. The German Ambassador to the U.S. will give plausible excuses to the U.S. with his tongue in his cheek because he knows the U.S. is not in a position to resent the insult with dignity or effect but this is beside the subject of my letter. I have digressed and I resume. Perhaps the most despicable part of this treacherous act was that the German submarine flew the Austrian Flag because Germany is not at war with Italy but Austria is. Taking the circumstances into consideration as truthfully given by me in this letter I think you may venture but there is no doubt whatever my dear Bessie that there is a risk. Now with regard to Conscription, I believe it will come. The end of this month will decide that point When this war commenced, neither Great Britain nor any other country looked forward to such a severe strain upon the nations engaged in this war, and Great Britain evidently thought she could get all the men she wanted by volunteers. But since that time Turkey and Bulgaria have thrown in their lot with the Central powers, and Greece and Rumania while yet standing aloof, are shrewdly suspected of favouring the Central powers, and thus the Allies have need of all the men they can possibly get. A Ministry of Recruiting has been established in in England with Lord Derby at its head, and every kind of inducement and persuasion are held forth to men of military age to join the Colours; and if a sufficient number do not volunteer, then conscription will certainly come. Perhaps you may not clearly understand what this conscription means. It means that all men of military age that is to say between the age of 19 and 45 years are to be called to join the Colours and go to battle; but they have first about 6 months training - spartan training - before they would be of much use in the battle line. In this conscript, the first call will be on unmarried men, and all of this class must be exhausted before there is any call on the married men. There are exceptions suppose a married man volunteers he will of course be accepted, but Conscription means compulsion, and I believe Bessie that compulsion is bound eventually to come. Your next query is with regard to Ireland and what is likely to be her position after the war. The consideration of that is a very fascinating one, and I shall reply to you at length, but to do so now would mean my missing this post, and I musnt do that. Meantime give my love, and that of all mine to Uncle Willie and Aunt Barbara, and with the love of Mamma and Bab, I remain as ever fondly\u000a\u000a                                                           Your father\u000a\u000a                                                                              Denis O'Driscoll

VOne of a collection of letters which Denis O' Driscoll (d. 1920) wrote to his daughters Elizabeth (Bessie) and Susanna (Sue) who had earlier emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts. He writes about his health, family news and his job in the Local Government Board. He tells Bessie about her brother, who is fighting in the First World War, the dangers he faces and the luck that he has survived unscathed. The letter was written in 1916 and Denis comments that the war is nearly over, though it would not end for another two years. He also mentions that to write about the rebuilding of Dublin after the Rising and the coming of Home Rule would take a letter each and that he will write again.

VI was speaking to Cecilia Kelly a couple of days ago, and she told me that Mollie had received a letter from you and that they were all much pleased. When on that evening I arrived home I found our Mollie awaiting me, and she told me that she had received a parcel from you but no letter. She seemed very much pleased of your attention and kindness and said that she would write to you in a day or two's time.

VI was speaking to Cecilia Kelly a couple of days ago, and she told me that Mollie had received a letter from you and that they were all much pleased. When on that evening I arrived home I found our Mollie awaiting me, and she told me that she had received a parcel from you but no letter. She seemed very much pleased of your attention and kindness and said that she would write to you in a day or two's time. I never saw Mollie looking better, of which I am very glad, as her state is, I learn from some hints from her Mother <hi rend="underline">interesting</hi>. <note>Mollie was pregnant with the mother of this transcriber.

I enclose Finnie's last letter which speaks for itself, and in passing I cannot too deeply impress upon you my gratitude to him for his constant and filial devotion to me when in the thick of battle - and Finnie is I know in the very teeth of it - he manages to send me word from the few moments he has to recoup human nature. I most earnestly thank God for his safety so far and I pray earnestly for a continuance of the Divine Protection. When it is considered that he has been in the forefront of danger since the first shot in this terrible war was fired, now two years ago, I cannot but think that God has in His mercy something good in store for him.

VGerald O'Dricoll (d. 1946) was in the British Navy and this letter, to his father, was written from H.M.S.Temeraire.  In the letter he describes his shock at the 'rebellion in Dublin' and refers to the reaction of he and his fellow soldiers at the front to the Rising, noting that 'our fellow country-men at the front felt it all the more keenly'. His reaction is typical of many Irish soldiers in the British army; he laments the destruction of Sackville Street (O'Connell Street) and refers to one of the rebels as a 'half-demented, crazy, misguided fool'. He also writes about family matters and an annual boxing tournament.

Vfool Willie Halpin is also one of them. Patriotism! My God! and he knows as much about Irish History as a Fiji cannibal. The outcome of it was death and sorrow, and the destruction of the finest and statliest street in Europe; - a street that every Dublin man, must have been justly proud.\u000aThings up here are very much the same, as far as I am at liberty to disclose.

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were b

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were b

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were b

VThe usual chaff from them all. Mrs G said I was a sly boy. Now I wonder am I. I thought that every one could see as plain as possible that I was after you for a very long time past. To tell truth the only thing I ever found wrong with you was your age. I was always ashamed to speak and so I put it off although I have the idea at the back of my head for the last three or four years.\u000aWell, my dearest dear, it's twelve midnight now so I must close up. I couldn't manage to write in time for first and know I shouldn't have time tomorrow but you'll have this on Tuesday. Let me know early what day you're coming. I shall close now with warmest love and kisses to my dearest girl.\u000aGoodbye, dear.\u000aYour loving\u000aJames

VLanguage. I was very sorry indeed to see that you are not yet quite well and I sincerely trust - selfishness as usual - that it won't interfere with my seeing you this week. It is sweet of you to say that you are looking forward to your visit to Dublin. You can imagine how I look forward  to it and to seeing my dear girl in a few days more. Please don't get into the dumps again. If you do, I'll be inclined to think you're getting sorry for your bargain. Just to cheer you up I'll tell you a joke. I was coming home one day about a week ago and as usual I was thinking about you - I may confess this is a habit of about three years standing - I looked up suddenly and there was Venus shining down on me benevolently from the evening sky. This is gospel truth - and ever since I have her company on my way home in the evening. If you like to see for yourself , you'll see her any evening about half an hour after sunset in the Western sky. You can't mistake her as you can't see any other star so early after sunset. So now you know.\u000aI wrote to Mrs Sary on Friday as well as yourself so I hope that will service her jealousy and keep her in good humour till I see you both. I was way laid on O'Connell Bridge yesterday by Josephine , Mrs George and Kathleen and had to stand the

VPatrick Henry Pearse (1879-1916) was a writer and school headmaster. A key member of the military council of the IRB who planned the Easter Rising, Pearse was one of the signatories of the proclamation of the Irish republic (largely his own writing), which he read outside the GPO after the outbreak of the Rising. As president of the provisional government Pearse called the surrendered and was executed on 3 May 1916.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written in December 1915 from St. Enda's College, a bilingual school founded by Pearse. It was probably written to Joseph Michael Stanley, a printer, and refers to the printing of Christmas cards. Pearse offers a stanza of his own poetry for the front of one of the cards and writes that he has written a short piece for the other. He suggests using the Irish version on the front and printing an English version inside the card.

For the Volunteer one I give a stanza from a Volunteer marching song of mine which, I think, is suitable. I have written a short verse for the Bethlehem card, -a sort of Christmas prayer for Ireland. I think you had better leave the English verses inside. It would be hard to get anything as good in Irish, and by having English inside you will appeal to a larger circle of purchasers.\u000aI wish I could do better.\u000aWith kindest regards\u000aSincerely yours\u000aP.H.Pearse\u000aP.S. - Please let me see proofs if possible

VThe letter is from the printer Joseph Michael Stanley (1890-1950) to playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950). Stanley refers to a raid on his printing firm during which a copy of Shaw's book 'Plays for Puritans' was taken from an employee. Stanley asks if the military have declared the book 'seditious'.\u000a\u000aBelow is the reply from Shaw stating that he does not think that the raid was for copies of the book but suggests that a 'zealous police officer' may have spotted a reference to King George and taken the book for that reason.\u000a\u000aSoon after, Stanley's printing press was used to print the proclamation of the Irish republic.

VThe letter is from Fred Allan, a member of the Irish National Aid Association. The association was founded after the Rising to provide relief to the dependents of those who were executed, killed in the fighting or had lost their employment. It later merged with the Irish Volunteer Dependents' Fund to form the Irish National Aid and Volunteer Dependents' Fund. The letter refers to the printing of a pamphlet of songs about the Rising. The pamphlets would be sold to raise funds and a garden fete and performance of the songs is also mentioned. The Stanley mentioned is Joseph Michael Stanley, a printer.

VThe letter is from Count George Noble Plunkett (1851-1948) to his daughter Geraldine (b. 1891). Count Plunkett has a nationalist and a papal count. He had been sworn in to the IRB by his son, Joseph Mary Plunkett (1887-1916), before the Rising and arrested afterwards. Joseph was a signatory of the proclamation of the Irish republic and was executed for his part in the Rising. Count Plunkett was elected as an MP in 1918 and was a member of the first Dáil. The letter is from Richmond Barracks where he was being held. He requests food, makes reference to a visit by Geraldine that 'lifted his heart' and the 'joy' of being clean. He also asks that she communicates with her mother, who had also been arrested.

VThe letter is from Count George Nobel Plunkett (1851-1948) to his daughter Geraldine (b. 1891). Count Plunkett has a nationalist and a papal count. He had been sworn in to the IRB by his son, Joseph Mary Plunkett (1887-1916), before the Rising and arrested afterwards. Count Plunkett was elected as an MP in 1918 and a member of the first Dáil. Joseph was a signatory of the proclamation of the Irish republic and was executed for his part in the Rising. The letter is from Richmond Barracks where he was being held. He refers to some good news delivered to Geraldine by a solicitor, requests some money and thanks Geraldine for food she had sent.

VThe letter is from Peter McBrien to Geraldine Plunkett Dillon (1891-1986). Geraldine was a sister of Joseph Mary Plunkett, one of the signatories of the proclamation of the Irish republic who was executed for his part in the Easter Rising. The letter refers to a collection of Joseph's poetry which was posthumously published under the title 'The poems of Joseph Mary Plunkett' and edited by Geraldine, who also provided a preface. McBrien praises both the preface and the book.

VThe letter is a facsimile copy of the first page of a letter written by Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was in Germany. He spent eighteen months in Germany, arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders, attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms. Casement succeeded in securing limited German support but his attempt to form a brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful. Believing that German support was insufficient, Casement travelled to Ireland to prevent the planned rebellion but was arrested after landing in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising and was hanged in London in August 1916.\u000a\u000aThe letter is critical of the 'transparent lies and obnoxious boastings' or some unnamed people, which he believes as symptoms of a 'John Bull' (i.e. English) make up.

VThe letter is a facsimile copy of a letter written by Sir Roger Casement. He spent eighteen months in Germany, arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders, attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms. Casement succeeded in securing limited German support but his attempt to form a brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful. Casement had returned to Ireland with the hope of preventing the Rising but was arrested after he landed in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising. He was hanged in London in August 1916.\u000a\u000aBy the time this letter was written, Casement had been marginalized by the Rising's planners and his relations with the Germans had become strained as he felt they were not willing to offer enough assistance. In the letter, he complains that he is in a 'dreadful situtation'. If he goes (presumably to Ireland) he would end up as a convict, a fate worse than death', but if he stays he would

VThis is a printed pamphlet of a letter by Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916), Robert Montieth (1879-1956) and Daniel Julian Bailey (aka Sergeant Beverly) in English and German. Casement had spent eighteen months in Germany attempting to secure German support for an uprising in Ireland and raising an ultimately unsuccessful brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps. By the time the farewell letter was written, Casement had been become disillusioned with German assistance and marginalized from the plans for the Rising. He believed there should be no rising without sufficient German support and when he realised that it was going ahead with only a small supply of German arms, he traveled to Ireland to prevent it from taking place. The letter was to inform the Irish recruits that they would be leaving and to explain why they would not fight. The Germans supplied a submarine to transport Casement, Monteith and Beverly to Ireland but Casement and Beverly were captured after they landed in Kerry on the ev

VMartin Kennedy was from Balleen, Freshford, Co. Kilkenny and left Ireland as a young man in 1916. He had studied with the Christian Brothers in Waterford. After leaving Ireland he spent time in New York before moving on to Saint Louis and then traveling down through Central America to South America, working as an engineer along the way. He settled for a few years in Argentina, where he taught English. He later moved to New York, where he had a career as a Spanish teacher in the public school system. This letter appears to be from a friend who had recently moved to Downpatrick (presumably a Christian Brother?). The letter is part of a stack of papers detailing various aspects of Martin Kennedy's life that were saved by his nephew after Martin's death in 1984.\u000a\u000aThe letter laments Martin's decision to leave Ireland makes reference to the 'terrible things' that had recently happened in Ireland. The Easter Rising had recently been defeated and the executions of the leaders was under way when the letter was sent.

VThese are items relating to Patrick and Ellen O'Loughlin who ran a small shop selling second-hand clothes, boots and goods. Included are a tenant's book from the shop on 32 Lower Kevin Street, Dublin commencing in 1906, a passbook recording rent paid on the premises, a photograph of the shop and a pass from the Commissioner of the Dublin Metropolitan Police allowing Patrick to move around the city (this was presumably issued while martial law was in place in Dublin after the Easter Rising).\u000a\u000aThe surviving 1916 letters of Patrick and Ellen were written while Patrick was on a trip to Glasgow to buy goods and also included are a letter from Mrs Graham, from whom Patrick regularly bought, and a receipt for the goods bought on the trip mentioned in the letters

VLetter from Colonel Maurice Moore to Prime Minister, H.H. Asquith advising him to put a stop to further executions of the leaders of the Easter Rising.  He believes it could bring acts of revenge as well as would 'keep the two countries apart for years'.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aColonel Maurice George Moore (10 August 1854 \u2013 8 September 1939) was an Irish author, soldier and politician. Born in Co Mayo, he was the younger brother of the writer George Moore.  He reached the rank of colonel in 1902. He resigned his commission in 1906 over matters of principle during the Boer War. \u000a\u000aA member of the provisional committee of the Irish Volunteers in 1913, he was made the organisation's Inspector General, spending much of 1914 organising the troops in Ireland.[3]  In 1916 he he collected a petition with Agnes O'Farrelly asking for a reprieve of the death sentence against Roger Casement. Later Moore was elected to the Senead.

VLetter from Gertrude Bannister to Colonel  Maurice Moore in which she encloses clippings from The Times's of  Sergeant O'Sullivan's defence of Roger Casement and suggests that they be reprinted  in the Irish Press. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGertrude Bannister (later Parry) was a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aColonel Maurice George Moore (10 August 1854 \u2013 8 September 1939) was an Irish author, soldier and politician.

VMartin Kennedy, who was born in Tullaroan, Co Kilkenny in 1891, had emigrated to New York in 1915 and was teaching in Westchester, New York. This letter accompanied the return of a form required by the New York City School system to outline applicants' educational background. The envelope was opened and resealed by the censor. Martin Kennedy left New York in December 1916, then spent six months teaching at Jefferson College in Louisiana, then travelled through South America, spending three months at the Eagle Ironworks in Peru, a year at the Chile Exploration Company, and then several years teaching in Buenos Aires. He eventually wound up spending several decades as a Spanish teacher in New York City. He died in 1983. The photograph is from 1928.

VThis is a copy of a letter sent by Joseph Devlin MP (1871-1934) to a Mr Rooney. Devlin was a key organiser for the Irish Parliamentary Party, an influential constitutional nationalist and had been an MP since 1902. In the aftermath of the Easter Rising, Devlin supported the temporary partition of Ireland but the scheme collapsed. In the letter, written around this time, Devlin writes that 'we do not want any arms in Ireland, and will not have any' and that they are trying to remove arms from Ireland rather than bring them in.

He fought in the North King Street area during the Easter Rising and was imprisoned afterwards. He later became publicity officer in the Dáil government and edited the IRA newspaper 'An t-Oglach'.\u000a\u000aThe letter refers to a copy of a speech made by Sweetman which Béaslaí had requested.

VThe letter is from William Pearse (1881-1916) to Michael Joseph O'Rahilly ('The O'Rahilly') (1875-1916). William Pearse was the brother of Patrick Pearse and fought under him in the GPO during the Easter Rising. He held the rank of captain and served on occasion as acting chief of staff but in reality had no power. Despite this, he pleaded guilty at his court martial and was executed on 4 May. The O'Rahilly was a journalist and prominent member of the Irish Volunteers. The letter is an order from William Pearse to The O'Rahilly with instructions for the Easter Sunday manoeuvres of the Irish Volunteers. The planners of the Rising, Patrick Pearse included, intended to use these manoeuvres to launch their rebellion but they were cancelled by Eoin MacNeill and the planners decided to go ahead with limited numbers on Easter Monday. Before the Rising broke out, The O'Rahilly, who was opposed to the plans, had been delivering MacNeill's countermanding order around the country but once the Rising started he decided t

Upon <sic>hom</sic>also was a letter written to his wife after he was wounded in which he said he was shot leading a charge. He got into an entry on the side of the street and later endeavoured to crawl to an opening on the other side.

VThe letter is from James Connolly (1868-1916) to Michael Joseph O'Rahilly ('The O'Rahilly') (1875-1916). Connolly was a trade union organiser and head of the Irish Citizen Army. In 1916 Connolly became part of the plans for the Easter Rising and was one of the signatories of the proclamation of the Irish republic, with the rank of commandant general of the forces in Dublin. He was executed on 12 May 1916. The O'Rahilly was a journalist and prominent member of the Irish Volunteers. The planners of the Rising intended to use the Easter Sunday manoeuvres of the Irish Volunteers to launch their rebellion but they were cancelled by Eoin MacNeill and the planners decided to go ahead with limited numbers on Easter Monday. Before the Rising broke out, The O'Rahilly, who was opposed to the plans, had been delivering MacNeill's countermanding order around the country but once the Rising started he decided to join in and was stationed in the GPO. The letter was written by Connolly from the GPO on the first day of the Ri

VThe letter is from Kuna Meyer (1858-1919) to Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). Meyer was a German philologist and scholar who had founded the School of Irish Learning to promote the Irish language and was a close friend of Casement. The letter was written to Casement while he was in Germany. Casement spent eighteen months in Germany, arriving first as an envoy of Irish-American leaders, attempting to encourage Germany to support Irish separatist aspirations by providing arms. He succeeded in securing limited German support but his attempt to form a brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps to fight against Britain was largely unsuccessful. Believing the German support was insufficient, Casement travelled to Ireland to prevent the planned rebellion but was arrested after in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising. He was hanged in London in August 1916.\u000a\u000aMeyer, whose pro-German stance was unpopular in the US (from where he writes), refers to American public interest in World War I and is critical o

VThe letter is from playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950) to Gertrude Parry (née Bannister). Bannister was a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister and Shaw were heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. The letter refers to an enclosure that has not survived and a letter by Shaw that was refused for publication in the Times and Daily News newspapers.\u000a\u000aCasement was hanged in London in August 1916.

VThe letter is from Dora Shorter (née Sigerson) to Gertrude Parry (née Bannister), a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. Dora, wife of literary critic Clement Shorter, was a friend of Casement. The letter refers to arrangements for a meeting between the two.

VThe letter is from Fr. E.F. Murnane to Sidney Parry. It refers mainly to arrangements for Parry's marriage to Gertrude Bannister, a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written the month after Casement was hanged in London for treason, having been arrested in Kerry on the eve of Easter Rising. In the letter, Fr Murnane refers to the Casement's execution and explains that the regulars at the church where they will be married prayed for Casement and drowned our the 'barbarous cheers' of others.

VMichael Gorman was one a large Catholic family living at a farm in Ballinalug, County Laois (then Queen\u2019s County). Susan Fitzgerald (d. 1980) was one a Church of Ireland family living in Raheenahone House near Stradbally, County Laois, also in the Slieve Bloom mountains. At the time the letter was written they were involved in a courtship but owing to the religious difference the love affair had to be kept secret. Eventually both were in Dublin: he in the Albert Agricultural College in Glasnevin (where he eventually became Professor of Agricultural Botany and Biochemistry) and she as a volunteer nurse in the Royal Hospital in Baggot Street. They eventually went to London to marry.\u000a\u000aThe letter refers mainly to a proposed meeting of the pair and Susan writes that she had been dropping hints to her mother to go for a holiday so they could meet in her house. She also briefly refers to events at home and to some mutual friends including 'Drew', James P Drew who went on to become a professor and head of Albert Co

The telegram was sent while Casement was imprisoned in Brixton after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason. The telegram informs her that she can visit Casement that day between 11 and 12.30am.

VThe letter is from J.S. Northcote of St. Andrew's Vicarage to Gertrude Bannister (later Parry), a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe letter was written in relation to the decision of Queen Anne's school to terminate Banniter's employment there as she had received wide publicity for her Casement campaign. She is informed, however, that the governors of the school will not make the reasons for the termination public. The writer asserts that she had given satisfactory employment and that he is happy to testify to this if she seeks similar work.

VThis is a copy of a letter sent by Gertrude Bannister, a cousin of Roger Casement (1864-1916), to C. Spencer Smith of Queen Anne's School in London. The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aOwing to the publicity Bannister had drawn through her Casement campaign the school had decided to terminate her employment but would not make the reason for termination public. In the letter, Bannister requests the explicit reason for the termination as it was unlikely to have been owing to unsatisfactory service. She asks that the matter be out before the board of governors but insists that she will not appeal the decision.

VCopy of letter sent to C,Spencer Smith July 29th 1916\u000aDear Sir\u000aI beg to acknowledge receipt of yr letter gladly enclosing my Thrift Scheme securities & a cheque for £40 in lieu of notice.\u000aI think that after 17 years service, during which time I have had no notification from either the Head Mistress or the Governors that my work at Queen Anne's School was otherwise than satisfactory (which I think I am entitled to assume it was in consideration of the fact that the Governors the Governors entrusted to me  the control of the School during the Head Mistress's absence of four months in India)<del>that</del> I am entitled to ask them to be more explicit as to the reasons which have inspired them to dismiss me from their service. It will be easily understood that a bare statement such as is contained in the resolution passed by the Committee ?has? itself open to several constructions. As the Agreement with the Governors referred to states that a Mistress is only dismissed from their service without notice for serious misconduct or other causes equally grave it will most assuredly leave me open to the implication that it was for some such reason I was dismissed. The Head Mistress's letter, stating merely that the Committee do not think it wise for me to return also gives no clear reason.\u000aP.T.O.

VI therefore ask you to be so very kind as to lay this matter before the Chairman of the Governors & to ask him as a matter of common fairness to one who has done her best to render faithful & useful service to the School for nearly 17 years to state clearly the real reason for which I am dismissed.\u000aPlease understand that I do not in any way appeal against my dismissal, I accept it without any comment, but I think the Governors cannot fail to see the justness of my request that I should be clearly told why they think I am no longer fitted to be in their service.\u000aYours faithfully\u000aGA Bannister

VThe letter is from E. Blackwell of the Home Office in London to Gertrude Bannister (later Parry), a cousin of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written while Casement was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. Bannister was heavily involved in raising public support for Casement during his trial for treason.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aBlackwell writes on behalf of the secretary of state for the Home Office, Herbert Samuel, 1st Viscount Samuel (1870-1963). He advises that after a petition from Bannister relating to Casement's sentence Simon has decided that there were no grounds for him to interfere in the matter.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCasement was hanged on 3 August 1916, the day after the letter was written.

VThe letter is from British literary critic Clement King Shorter (1857-1926) to playwright George Bernard Shaw (1856-1950). The letter was written while Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) was imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. A campaign was launched featuring many prominent figures such as W.B. Yeats and George Bernard Shaw to secure a reprieve for Casement but he was hanged on 3 August 1916.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aShorter was married to Dora Sigerson (1866-1918), a friend of Casement's, and in the letter he asks Shaw to sign a petition compiled by Sir R. Conan Doyle for a reprieve for Casement. The campaign, he writes, hoped for support from 'moderates'. Shaw himself became heavily involved in the campaign.

VThe letter was written by Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928), then Liberal Prime Minister of Great Britain. The letter is a response to an appeal for clemency for Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) who was under a sentence of death. He writes that the British Cabinet had decided that they could not offer a reprieve. Casement had been imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. A campaign was launched featuring many prominent figures such as W.B. Yeats and George Bernard Shaw to secure a reprieve for Casement but he was hanged on 3 August 1916, the day after this letter was written.

The letter is a response to an appeal for clemency for Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) who was under a sentence of death having been arrested in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising. It is an appeal for clemency for Casement and points out that no progress will be made in the Irish question by executing Casement and argues against coercion of Ireland.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aA campaign had been launched featuring many prominent figures such as W.B.

Casement had been born into a Protestant family but received the Catholic sacraments on the eve of his death. The letter also gives a glowing description of Casement's last moments before his death.

VThe letter is from the lawyer John Hartman Morgan (1876-1955) to Herbert Samuel (1870-1963), secretary of state for the Home Office. Morgan was an expert in constitutional law and was working with the British propaganda department on German atrocities but served as counsel for Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) in his treason trial, with whom he had corresponded previously. Casement had been imprisoned in London after he had been arrested while landing on the coast of Kerry in a submarine on the eve of the Easter Rising. A campaign was launched featuring many prominent figures such as W.B. Yeats and George Bernard Shaw to secure a reprieve for Casement but he was hanged on 3 August 1916.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written the day after Casement's death and Morgan requests the return of Casement's body to his cousin, Gertrude Bannister, for burial in Ireland. He argues that Casement had already suffered the highest punishment possible and that the 'pitiful request' of his relative should be granted on human grounds. Casement

I did this because I <lb/> was deeply moved by the distress of a noble woman whose un- <lb/> flinching devotion to her cousin through the long-drawn agony <lb/> of his trial was such as to provoke my profound admiration and <lb/> respect. I did not &#x2014; indeed as Counsel I could not &#x2014; sup- <lb/> port the movement he has not only died a felon's death on the scaffold <lb/> but before dying he was publicly degraded of all his honours, <lb/> a step for which I believe there is no precedent in any treason <lb/> case in the last 300 years. The law has therefore exacted its uttermost.</p> <p>Under these circumstances it is surely not asking <lb/> too much to ask that the pitiful request of his relatives be <lb/> granted. Roger Casement is now beyond the reach of human <lb/> vengeance; it cannot matter to him whether his body remains in <lb/> a felon's grave in Pentonville or not. But it matters a great <lb/> deal to this unhappy lady sorrowing under a sorrow almost too <lb/> grievous for any man or woman to bear. I cannot conceive <pb/>

It is not <lb/> for me to urge any questions  of policy though I can imagine <lb/> few things more likely to exasperate Irish opinion than an <lb/> implacable severity which wounds the living while it is quite <lb/> powerless to harm the dead. Moreover there is a very strong <lb/> feeling abroad &#x2014; the "Times" gives expression to it this morning <lb/> that someone in authority "inspired" a campaign of malignant <lb/> and studied calumny against the prisoner which was not only <lb/> not necessary to the course of Justice but calculated to per- <lb/> vert it.

Gavan Duffy had represented Casement but the case was unsuccessful and Casement was due to be executed on the following day.\u000a\u000aBlackwell is responding to Gavan Duffy's request that Casement's body be bured outside of prison walls, the desire of Casement's family, and that he be allowed to be present at the execution, noting that the Secretary of State for the Home Office (Herbert Samuel) could not accede to the request.

VThis letter was written in response to E. Blackwell's letter of 2 August, rejecting George Gavan Duffy's request to attend the execution of Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916) and the family request for burial outside of the prison. Gavan Duffy (21 October 1882 \u2013 10 June 1951) argues that execution for treason is different from that for murder and the requirement for burial within the prison is not therefore not valid.\u000a\u000aGavan Duffy qualified as a solicitor and practised in London. He defended Casement at his trial for high treason following Casement's arrest on the eve of the Easter Rising. Tthe case was unsuccessful and Casement was executed on 3 August 1916, the day this letter was written.

I am enclosing a list but think that it does not represent the total sent in, as in each case the people to whom forms were sent were asked to enlist their friends in these districts and some of them did so. Mr. Claud Cherasse wrote out a form of petition in Gaelic which he sent to some friends in Gaelic districts. I think it highly probably that in each place these petitions were signed and forwarded, but only in two instanced did the people concerned write to say they had forwarded the petitions.

The letter is a reply to Gavan Duffy's letter of the same date and refers him to the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868, which requires the burial of persons executed to be buried in the prison. Gavan Duffy had requested release of the body to the family. This letter is dated on 3 August, which is the date of Casement's execution.

VThe writer of this letter, Ella Young (1867\u20131956), was a poet, republican, and mystic actively involved in the Celtic Revival. In this letter, written on 9 August 1916, she reports on the collection of signatures for the reprieve of Roger Casement (who was hanged for treason on 3 August, having been arrested on the eve of the Easter Rising) and includes a list of petitions by location. She comments that there could have been many more petitions circulated if there had been more slips and more workers available.\u000a\u000aThe recipient, Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929, a nationalist, historian, and a friend of Roger Casement, was heavily involved in the campaign for him to be reprieved.

VThe letter is from George Gavan Duffy (21 October 1882-10 June 1951) to the under secretary of state for the Home Office in London, E. Blackwell. Gavan Duffy defended Sir Roger Casement at his trial for high treason after the Easter Rising, although the case was unsuccessful and Casement was executed on 3 August 1916.\u000a\u000aThis letter is in response to the Secretary of State's decision to apply the capital punishment amendment of 1868 to the execution of Casement. This act requires the body to be buried within the prison. Gavan Duffy argues that this applies only to murder and not for treason. He also comments on the family's belief that they have been "grievously wronged" by the State in the rejection of their request for private burial. The letter was written the day after Casement's execution.

VIn this letter, dated 30 July 1916, James O\u2019Shea writes to Alice Stopford Green (1847-1929) to tell her of the unanimous opposition of the Public Boards of County Kerry to the execution of Roger Casement (who was charged with treason after being arrested just before the Easter Rising and alter hanged on 3 August 1916). He writes that he has signed a petition she had sent and suggests that she meet with the king, who O\u2019Shea is sure can be convinced that granting Casement a reprieve will help foster a better relationship between Ireland and England.\u000a\u000aStopford Green was a nationalist, historian, and a friend of Roger Casement was heavily involved in the campaign for him to be reprieved.

VThis letter is from Roger Casement (1864-1916) to the German Imperial Chancellor, Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg. Roger Casement, born in Sandycove was a former British Consul who, disillusioned with British imperialism became an Irish Nationalist. On his return to Ireland from Germany on Good Friday 1916 he was arrested at Banna Strand. He was tried for high treason  and hanged at Pentonville Prison on 3 August 1916. \u000a\u000aIn this letter Roger Casement writes to Theobold von Bethmann Hollweg looking for assurance that the members of the Irish Brigade in Germany will not be mistreated after his departure to Ireland. \u000a\u000aHe makes reference to an interview the two men had on 18 December 1914 with regards to German Policy towards Ireland and an agreement dating from 23-28 December that the volunteers of the Irish Brigade, now at Zossen, would not be harmed. \u000a\u000aThe Irish Brigade was mad up of Irish soldiers who had served in the British army but were captured by the German Imperial army and were now prisoners of war.

VThe letter is from the Dominican priest Fr. Thomas Crotty (d. 1930, born James but took the name Thomas after he joined the order) to Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written during Casement's eighteen month stay in Germany, where he was attempting to gain German support for an Irish rebellion against British rule. The letter refers to Casement's attempts to create an Irish Brigade of Irish-born British army soldiers who were then held as prisoners of war in German camps. It was the camp at Linberg, in the Lahn valley, that was designated for the project. Fr.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a Crotty was one of the priests who administered to the men in the camp at Limberg. The project was, however, largely unsuccessful and only fifty-six men signed up. Crotty mentions in the letter that Robert Monteith, the officer in charge of the Irish Brigade, 'hasn't much hope of succeeding' in Limberg but would do what he could to convince people of his views.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCasement was later arrested in County Kerry having returned to Ireland in

He hasn't much hopes of succeeding here, although he shall do what he can to convince them of his views of things.\u000aWrote last Wednesday to Mr. Meyer, and asked to get the permission to visit all the camps or some of them.

No more of the early departures are come back as I expected.

All very interesting, and for me sad reading.\u000aYou will be glad to hear that my journey to Munich and stay of 8 days there were very satisfactory. The Cardinal Nuntius hopes to do something for me and my flock. He quite understands matters, and is of my opinion regarding the changing of the men to the various camps. He sees no reason, considering my mission, why I should not be allowed to visit the camps where Irishmen are. I laid before him a full account of my

The Cardinal asked me if I had made application to the Ministry of War for permission to visit the camps , or if I had suggested the advisability of having all the Irishmen brought into one camp so that my ministry should be thereby very much lighter than it is. I told him I had written to a gentleman in the Auswaertiges Amt. and told him my grievances, and asked him to obtain this permission for me. I was assured both by Count von Wedel and Mr.Meyer that they would help me in everything. It was therefore to them I applied, but for some reason, no answer is forthcoming.\u000aA copy of my letter is I believe by this time in the Vatican, and I reason to believe that it shall be a testimony to the truth of affairs as they are, and not as they are represented to be by the Press reports that reach Rome.\u000aI shall say no more of my interview with his Eminence. Probably you shall get a look at my report when it reaches Berlin.\u000aCould it be possible that Mr.Meyer is from home? or has my letter been lost. In it I repeated my request for the leave to visit the camps just as the <hi rend="underline">English Protestant</hi> Mr.Williams has. I also reminded him that I am to settle my accounts for expenses of the past five months, for it is now that length of time since I had any funds given me.\u000aIf you should meet either Mr.Meyer or the Count von Wedel, I would ask you

I hope myself and the boys escape any bad colds during this inclement season. I heard during my stay in Bavaria, of the many interesting articles that appeared from your pen in the Press there. It is well  to have people know the history of Ireland. In Bavaria Irish History is always interesting as the people of that Nation, owe their Christianity to the labours of an Irish Missionary, whose name is honoured and revered there - Kilian - the Martyr Saint.\u000aIs there any chance of meeting you before Xmas? In any event may the Great Feast bring us joy and happiness and peace.\u000aYours v. sincerely\u000aJ.T. Crotty O.P.

I have a letter from an Irish Bishop who expresses himself much pleased at what was done. His words are - "We in Ireland owe much to the Holy Father and to the Kaiser for what they have done for our countrymen" - Is it not then a pity that anything should happen to interfere with such an impression, as to lessen in any degree the sense of obligation which the people in Ireland feel for what has been done?\u000aIn the event of the refusal of funds during my stay, I shall write to my relatives in Ireland who are blessed with much of this world's goods, and will ask them to pay for my stay as Spiritual Guide of my dear Countrymen. This of course would be the last resource, and one which I should not pursue unless driven to extremities, for I fear though my relatives should keep the secret, yet somehow or other such things leak out, and that would not do.

VThe letter is from M.P. Kehoe, to Sir Roger Casement (1864-1916). The letter was written during Casement's eighteen month stay in Germany, where he was attempting to gain German support for an Irish rebellion against British rule. The letter refers to Casement's attempts to create an Irish Brigade of Irish-born British army soldiers who were then held as prisoners of war in German camps. It was the camp at Linberg, in the Lahn valley, that was designated for the project. The project was, however, largely unsuccessful and only fifty-six men signed up. In the letter, Kehoe looks to arrange a meeting with Casement.\u000a\u000aCasement was later arrested in County Kerry having returned to Ireland in a submarine to try and prevent the Easter Rising from taking place as he felt German support was insufficient. He was hanged in London in August 1916.

The men who join are separated from others into a Barrack where German speaking Russians are & who have volunteered to fight with Germany it was proposed by Authorities here & accepted by Capt.M. because the men I am sure after hearing what we have to say to them & the system Mr.M. has adopted requires consideration & he gives them ample time , to-day one young fellow,  ?Comm Rgt? just went to his Coy Officer & said he wanted to join Irish Bde & was brought up to Barracks set apart for Bde.\u000aUp to now Mr.M. said after interviewing  about 250 or so he said 12 to 15 were likely candidates.

It is an individual method Mr.M. has, & between the number of interviews & the men I have on list from Zossen & those I know myself we will see about 70 or so per day. besides men are returning from farms every day since 1st Nov. I've heard that the men must be sent back to Camp after 1st Nov. & any of those kept at work must have special allowance.\u000aMy first day here brought luck, the first two actually joined & three others I am sure will come too.\u000aI have got a Mantle & Sword given me here from Authorities. the men in Camp have taken a different attitude towards us this time, they listen attentively, quietly & are never insulting. it is much easier to work with them.

Ceannt was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising and a signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. During the Rising he commanded the garrison in the South Dublin Union. Following the surrender he was tried by court-martial and sentenced to death. He was executed on 8 May 1916.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written from Richmond Barracks after Ceannt's trial and after the death sentence passed. A number of executions had already been carried out and Ceannt writes that his only regret is that he can no longer show his what he thinks of her. He will 'die like a man for Ireland's sake'.

VPhotocopy of a letter from Michael Collins (1890-1922) to his cousin Nancy O'Brien (who later married his brother) written from Frongach Internment Camp in Wales. Collins had served in the General Post Office as an aide-de-camp to Joseph Plunkett, a signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, and was interned for his role in the Rising. He went on to become one of the most important figures in the Irish struggle for independence.\u000a\u000aIn the letter he discusses conditions at the camp and the release of Irish prisoners, although he does not think he will be counted as one of their number. He also refers to mutual friends.

At present there is great excitement in these 'compunds; about the releases - about 40 r 50 daily. One never knows what mistake a Gov Dep might might make. Between you and me I don't think I'm likely to see the shores of Erin for some time.\u000aNow how are your colleagues goin on? Have written several times to Susan,.   some of the letters I already allude to may not have arrrived, but I have not had a note from her for some time. Dolly has not written either but she sends the Independent. \u000aI'd be obliged if you'd just say a word of thanks on my behalf. Your cigarts came alright and were very good. The Govt is much better than we were as to m.d. But its not possible to get anything as as fruit or any kind of decent cake etc. There is a Canteen - a dry one unhappily! Where we may get something in addition to the allowances. I suppose you know Eugene O'Keefe is here. Very well and in good form.\u000aMuch love\u000aMichael

VLetter from Private Oscar L. Disney, 22nd Royal Fusiliers, A Company, 3 Platoon, to Father Darlington. Disney was serving with the British Expeditionary Force and the letter gives news about his service. His company is at rest several miles back from the front. Disney writes primarily about his desire to gain a commission as an officer. He seems to have had a setback as his company officer, Captain Clifford, 'says it is no use his taking me before the colonel and asking that I be recommended, for he has done it for many and the colonel has absolutely refused to recommend any one, excepting for gallantry.' He hopes that Sir Henry Christopher Grattan Bellew (1860-1942), the third baronet of Mount Bellew in County Galway, might write a letter to his commanding officer recommending him for the commission.\u000a\u000aThis letter is  from a collection of miscellaneous letters relating to the Bellew family.

VLetter from C. Smyth, probably to Colonel Henry Grattan Bellew. Smyth is clearly writing while convalescing from a stomach wound and writes about his recovery and hopes of returning to service. He mentions the death of 'a nice quiet youngster' and about damages at Bere Island which it seems the Company was liable for.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis letter is from a collection of miscellaneous letters, relating to the Bellew family. Sir Henry Christopher Grattan-Bellew, 3rd Baronet (1860-1942) was the third baronet of Mount Bellew in County Galway.

VLetter from Robert Monteith (1880-1956) to Roger Casement (1864-1916). Moneith was the Commander of the Irish Brigade, appointed by Casement. \u000a\u000aCasement spent eighteen months in total in Germany attempting to secure German support for an uprising in Ireland and raising an ultimately unsuccessful brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps. By April 1916, he had become become disillusioned with German assistance and marginalized from the plans for the Rising. He believed there should be no rising without sufficient German support and when he realised that it was going ahead with only a small supply of German arms, he traveled to Ireland to prevent it from taking place. The Germans supplied a submarine to transport Casement, Monteith and Sergeant Beverly (Daniel Bailey) to Ireland but Casement and Beverly were captured after they landed in Kerry on the eve of the Easter Rising.

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. \u000a\u000aDespite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. \u000a\u000aDespite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children.

V. I expect that's why the letter you posted home this day fortnight (how long ago it seems) didn't reach in time. I fact it's a struggle for me any day to write to you during the day at the office as I am constantly being interrupted by callers, men coming to submit cases for decision &c &c, and if I defer it until the rush is over it is too lat. So now admit I am a good little man to write so regularly especially as I have always been a rotten hand at writing letters. I always envy the people who can dash off pleasant chatty entertaining letters without any apparent trouble. Both Nora and Moll are great at that job, so is Baby Finn (my cousin) and you're a a very good hand at it yourself too. Whereas in my case after I have exhausted the "taking my pen in hand to write to you these few lines hoping you are well" and then fall back on the weather I'm stumped. I gave your message about the prayer book to Nora. She has been running around like a clucking hen for the past week or so since she lost it. I cleared you character with her but I think she blames Mrs Seery now. Anyhow she's quite sure it's between you it is, so you'd both better bring your own payer books the next time you come up. Glad to hear you're not losing your religion anyway. The unfortunate somebody you refer to is thinking the day will never come when you take him in charge. You'll have a heavy handful I'm afraid, but not as heavy I hope as Rose Duffy. The more you wipe your boots on some girls, the more they love you. It's a curious

She is charmed with both the office and the lodgings and will I'm sure be very happy. I suppose you have hardly had time to hear from Tim yet. Give my regards to your mother, Nano and the boys.

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him.\u000a\u000aDespite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again.

VNational Health Insurance Commission (Ireland)\u000aPembroke house\u000aUpper Mount Street\u000aDublin\u000a22nd  Feby 1916\u000aMy darling girl,\u000aToday again I am afraid I must put you off with a very short letter. I have been extremely hard pushed all day and am writing now under pressure in order to catch the post. Since I finished that last sentence I have been twice interrupted so I hope you will sympathise with my sad case. Since you\u2019re talking of pettishness, I may say I\u2019m as fond of sympathy as any child so from all points of view you\u2019ll have a hard time with me when you have

Vto put up with me every day for the remainder of our natural lives. My mother had a letter from Mrs Seery this morning letting us know the good news about Johnnie. We were all delighted on his account and hope he starts on his new job soon and that he will have the best of luck in it. \u000aI failed to keep my promise to you to write to her yesterday but I must try and manage a minute or two now to write her a line. I suppose I had better say that I will go down on Saturday and that I will meet you in Mullingar. I was amused to hear that Mrs John Duffy is only an object of curiosity in the country now. I expect we\u2019ll be the same presently but that they will all be coming to see me and not you as the object of curiosity to see what you could see in me to induce you to marry me. Glad to hear about all the romances. You can trust me to keep a quiet tongue in my head about them all. I haven\u2019t the pleasure of knowing Miss Fox\u2019s appearance but I expect she\u2019s good looking all right or Ned wouldn\u2019t be after her. How about your own brothers? They ought to be on the warpath soon if they take after their sisters who are all early birds . By the way, thanks for kisses which I succeeded in finding

Hope I won\u2019t have so much difficulty next time in getting the real thing.\u000aI have been again three times interrupted since I wrote page 1 so I will bring this rambling epistle to a close. In fact I\u2019m so bothered and worried just at the moment that I don\u2019t know what I have written so will you please, like a darling, forgive me. Probably I\u2019ll write again tomorrow. With my warmest love to my own darling and with heaps of kisses\u000aFrom her loving\u000aJames

I really didn\u2019t expect to hear from you and in any case I know very well that it is not always easy to get letters posted in Togherstown. I was very sorry indeed to hear that the real cause of your not writing was a recurrence of the headache you had at my place. I hope that my poor darling wasn\u2019t so bad as she was then. I pitied you very much that last evening you had the headache because I could see very well that you weren\u2019t really able to sit up. I\u2019m quite sure my mother didn\u2019t think you pettish for going to bed: you were quite right to go. I was glad to hear that Joe beat the Fays with his pigs \u2013 for the credit of the family name. I think Christy must have sold his too cheap especially if his \u201cpiebald\u201d was one of the lot. I\u2019m sure the piebald would go much more than £5:10:0 as a

I was very pleased to hear of the good opinion that Matty Keanan has of me. If I get many more \u201cflowers\u201d thrown at me like that I\u2019ll begin to fancy myself too much. I\u2019m beginning to think now that you were a fortunate little big girl to get hold of such a treasure. So you\u2019d better keep your nose very clean and be particularly nice to me (and above all don\u2019t refuse me kisses) or I\u2019ll go back on you. So now mind yourself. Glad to hear Tim is getting on so well and hope he will continue so. I wrote to Mrs. Seery on Friday to let her know I\u2019d be down Saturday evening. Perhaps she would come herself to the station to meet us if you suggest it. If not I suppose that the Fays are going to meet us and between the two houses we should have to walk. I don\u2019t care \u201ctuppence\u201d myself but I don\u2019t suppose you would enjoy stumping from Castletown. In fact I\u2019d much prefer walking if I had you to myself. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll write tomorrow as probably you\u2019d be gone to the station on Saturday before a letter could arrive. I have nothing else to say now except to send my dearest and most devoted love as usual. I shall live for the next two days on the expectation of Saturday. By the way, I didn\u2019t sleep last night till 2 o\u2019clock thinking about you\u000aWarmest love again my darling girl\u000aJames

VHerbert was my maternal grandmother\u2019s younger brother.  He died during WW1 aged 22 at Arras on 15th April 1917 and is commemorated on the Lutyens  Memorial in Arras. Herbert was from Kingscourt and while apprenticed to an outfitting firm in Drogheda, enlisted in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers. He served in Dublin during The Easter Rising 1916 and records events in this letter written to his mother on 5th May 1916 from the Royal Barracks Dublin. In it he describes the fighting in and around the city centre and the execution and burial of the ring-leaders Pierce,Connolly and Byrne.

I was very glad to have your letter this morn and very early I had it too, but I could not find energy to get through my few jobs having nothing to hurry for better than dinner, for the first time I felt a want in country life but I was not so silly as I call it as to let that be seen but I hurried to write this letter to you and then set to & make pancakes for the tea on account of Shrove Tuesday, it is a big job for so many but I wish there was one more.

I did not tell Mrs S, I was afraid she would say I had a right to mind them, she was up as usual last night, gave me \u201cdown the banks\u201d for not telling her anything.

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDespite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which we

O\u2019Leary, the manager, recommended both strongly and said he would get them going for a day or two to see which one was the better. They are at present racing against each other under his supervision and he will let me know on Friday which I should take. I shall send the watch on Friday evening so that you may have it in good time for Sunday or if you like I can get him to send you a selection of two or three on approval. Let me know would you prefer this. I shall probably not write tomorrow but will wait until I send watch on Friday. No news at all except that I am getting back into harness very well and am quite happy knowing that you love me. Thanks ever so much for the kisses which I return even more heartily than they were given. With all my dearest and warmest love and blessings to my darling from your future husband, James\u000aGive my warmest regards to our mother. Hope Christy is getting better xxxxxxx \u000a\u000aNational Health Commission (Ireland)\u000aPembroke House\u000aUpper Mount Street\u000aDublin\u000a8/3/1916\u000aI was delighted and pleased with your letter this morning. It has kept my heart ringing all day up to the present for it is clear all through it that you are not quite the superior \u201c sensible\u201d thing that you were trying to humbug me into believing.. It is the greatest possible comfort and happiness to me to know that my dear girl thinks of me so much and so highly. I suppose it\u2019s heartless to be glad to hear that you had recourse to tears on Monday night. Is this the superior girl that never cried and who was so contemptuous of me for being \u201csilly\u201d when I thought I was only affectionate? Well I am glad to see that you were moved to tears on my account and I love you all the more dearly (if that is possible) for it. For my part, I\u2019m not a bit inclined to cry these days. In fact I feel quite pleased with myself and inclined to shake myself by the hand- almost indeed to stand myself a drink- because I have been

Vso lucky as to get such a treasure as your love. The thought of it warms and comforts me so that I can almost feel something warm and singing within me all day long. I didn\u2019t have any pancakes for tea yesterday evening so I\u2019d have done better in more ways than one if I had been able to help you to eat yours. I suppose everyone forgot it at home and indeed I forgot it myself till I got your letter this morning. That\u2019s one of the advantages of being young like you; you don\u2019t forget the pleasant customs of the children. \u000aSorry to hear Mrs Seery has been worrying you over your secrets. I don\u2019t know why she should think you have any. The only thing between you and me is that we love each other dearly and I expect everyone can guess that pretty well (in my case anyhow) without being told it. I\u2019m not surprised that she thinks you\u2019re pretty clever although I hope she doesn\u2019t think you \u201csmart\u201d in the bad sense. I have certainly always thought you a young girl of remarkable character and intelligence and goodness, far beyond your very youthful years, and I am all the more delighted that I hooked the prize. What a dear sweet clever little wife I shall have one of these fine days! Well my dearest love, about the watch, I called into Hopkins yesterday and selected a couple of ..

I was very pleased to see by it you are keeping in such spirits. I am in the best of form now I was at Mass Ash Wed. Mass only because I\u2019m keeping my loaded conscience for a Mullingar priest if I can manage the point without anyone knowing it.-About the watch I think it would be better only send the one. I will rely on your taste I will be very anxious to have it for Sunday, just today I had an invitation for myself & Christy to spend Sunday eve with Mary Kelly Castletown. I dare say the bridegroom will be there & of course I will swank it before them as it may be the last time I\u2019ll ever see that party I did not want to go at all but Mother said it would look bad to fall black out people talk so much.\u000aWe had a letter from Jennie today she was full of the weddings that took place , the last day there were five going on all day the last one in the evening the groom came galloping like the D- (Jennie told me give you the hint) & all the cars after followed by a carriage

Vwith the bride & brides made (sic) they came back with the horse last, best man mounted & the carriage first with bride & groom, one man came running into Jack Healy an hour before his marriage for a ring, couldn\u2019t get one to fit in the town, that\u2019s what would have happen (sic) with us  if we had rushed it, you would be running to Fox\u2019s & the forge\u2019s workshop trying to get me fitted. Christy was in bed nearly all day yesterday, he is up today and seems to feel much better. Mrs Seery is very very anxious about Johnnie a bit vexed with him too that he\u2019s not more anxious, he went to Ballymore Tuesday & did not come back since to see if a letter had turned up, she is afraid he got in with Dan Kiernan or someone like that, the Cork affair looks very bad. Mrs S got a fancy match box in Tommy\u2019s possession a present from his girl of course, big oak with harps & shamrock on it. Mother was telling the lads today not to forget the Novena for the speedy end of the war to St Patrick, Christy said no such thing for when the war is over he is beggared- I have no news now so I\u2019ll conclude with my best love & very best love to my dear James from his loving\u000aMay

V...for two people to live together day in day out without little quarrels (I suppose even you and I will quarrel sometimes-I know I have a rather sullen temper) but I think you are both two sweet-tempered to be out for very long. With God\u2019s blessing we will all live happy and contented together and when I get out of temper, I hope I will always think of the sweet trustfulness and confidence so freely shown to me by the dear girl who gave herself to me in the first flower of her youth and beauty. Now that may sound a bit high flowing but it is all, my darling, true and sincere and heartfelt. Glad to hear that Christy is doing so well. Give my regards to your mother, Nano and all. I send you a thousand kisses and warmest and most heartfelt love. \u000aYours for ever & ever\u000aJames\u000a\u000aNational Health Commission (Ireland)\u000aPembroke House\u000aUpper Mount Street\u000aDublin\u000a11/3/1916\u000aMy ever dearest darling,\u000aI was more disgusted and disappointed this morning than I can explain when I saw from your letter that you had not received the watch. Hopkins\u2019 people made it up in a box in my presence on Thursday and sealed it for dispatch at once to the post. They wouldn\u2019t let me take it myself as they assured me that it would go off without delay. This was at 3 o\u2019clock and I can\u2019t understand why you should not have got it yesterday morning without fail especially as it was registered. I trust however it has turned up this morning. I was so anxious yesterday that there should be no hitch that when I got your letter saying you had been invited to Mary Kelly\u2019s I called up O\u2019Leary, the manager, on the telephone and questioned him closely as to whether the watch had certainly gone off all right on Thursday. I am very much annoyed over it, especially as I wanted to give you the pleasure of the surprise in getting it a day sooner than you had expected. I hope I may have a note from you in the morning to say that it arrived all right. You say that you are anxious to have the

Vwatch for a reason that I can guess. Well you can understand how anxious I am that you should have it for the very same reason, that I love my dearest girl above and far beyond anything else in this world. I\u2019m not ashamed to say that to you although you seem to be shy of saying the same. Still I hope that it is true although you don\u2019t say it. Thanks, love for the kisses. You wouldn\u2019t ask \u201cwho is good in the holy season to send them\u201d. I know very well that my dear sweet girl is always good so that I hope you won\u2019t expect me to take too seriously the references to loaded consciences and sin and all the rest of it. I imagine the priest must have a job to keep from laughing sometimes when he hears your \u201csins\u201d.\u000aI was very much amused to hear about the rush of marriages in Mitchelstown. I don\u2019t imagine our case would have been so bad if we had suddenly taken the sweet madness of getting married last week. Anyhow the hurry and little difficulties of that sort add to the pleasant romance and the dear happiness of carrying off your own little wife almost by main force and marrying her out of hand. The more I think of it, the more I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do it so there\u2019s no use your trying to frighten me by horrible examples from Mitchelstown. I taxed my mother with what you told me about Father Moran and she only laughed so I don\u2019t think she is inclined to be too downhearted over our marriage. I feel quite sure that you and she will get on famously and will grow to like each other more the more you see of each other. \u000aOf course it\u2019s not always easy

I\u2019m sure you will all be busy in the next four weeks and I wouldn\u2019t like to be keeping you from your work, entertaining a silly love-sick ass like me so I won\u2019t speak of it anymore unless you do it beforehand. Glad to hear Christy is improving so much. I suppose Kerrigan was only making a big fellow of himself by making him out to be so bad. Hope everyone at home is well also at Lockardstown I am writing to Mrs S. today. Bad job about Johnnie. Ask him can I help him at all when you see him. Give my regards to everyone. I send you my warmest and sincerest love and kiss your dear hands a thousand times.\u000ayour happy husband-to-be\u000aJames\u000a \u000a\u000aNational Health Commission (Ireland)\u000aPembroke House\u000aUpper Mount Street\u000aDublin\u000a13/3/1916\u000aMy dearest love,\u000aI was delighted to see by your letter of yesterday that you were pleased with the watch and with my taste in the selection. As a matter of fact my one regret in the matter is that I couldn\u2019t afford to buy you one much more in keeping with my love for you. As regards my taste being better in the watch than in the wife, I wish to remark (as Bret Harte would say) that anyone could get that same watch or a better one any day in the week for a few pounds whereas there is only one May Fay and money couldn\u2019t buy her. She was fool enough to sell herself (or rather give herself away) without properly realising her own value. That\u2019s why I shall always be inclined to reproach myself for taking you at a mean disadvantage because you were too innocent to value yourself enough and foolish enough to value me too highly. However as I have already said in my last letter I do love and honour you to the best of my poor power for your dear goodness and sweetness and with God\u2019s help I\u2019ll try to manage so that you may never too much regret confiding in me. I need hardly say how much I feel proud and glad and flattered to see from your letters and your manner to me that you do think of me and that you do love me

I can never understand why it should be so but I hug myself with pleasure that it is so.\u000aI shall be looking forward with great interest to your letter of tomorrow morning (I hope) with a full and true account of what happened at the Kelly\u2019s party on Sunday.

In my case anyhow I find it very difficult to resist you at any time but I think the emotion produced is not fear so much as something very different. I always want to take you in my arms and smother you with kisses. By the way talking of kisses I must say that I have formed a very high opinion of the intelligence and good sense of Father Flynn, your recent confessor, and I feel quite grateful to him for making your tender conscience easy on that score. The prospect sounds so promising and appetising that I feel almost inclined to swoop down on you some week and soon and take advantage of the greater generosity which I presume you are now prepared to show me. To tell the honest truth, I\u2019m beginning to feel the want of you more and more every day and worse and worse so that I very much doubt if I shall be able to hang on till Easter without seeing and kissing your dear face again and hearing your dear voice. So don\u2019t be surprised if you hear of my arrival in the country about the end of the month. Seriously however, if you wouldn\u2019t like me to come- I mean if you think it would be better for me not to come, I will wait and possess my soul in patience until ...

I haven\u2019t a word of news unfortunately to send you. Last night I brought home two or three files of papers from the office to clear up staff matters which have been bothering me for a good while past. Certain of the temporary male clerks at present employed here are likely to be dispensed with about the end of the month and it was up to me to provide an expedient (?) That\u2019s one of my particular little worries, to deal with staff questions, rearrange duties for each person, look after the getting of money voted by Parliament for salaries re.(?) and so on and so forth until I get worried to death nearly sometimes and feel inclined to throw a book at the head of some silly ass who comes to me asking what he is to do with some simple case he is dealing with.

Eventually I went to sleep and dreamed about you, that we had quarrelled- I forget whether before or after marriage- and made it up in the end after a lot of tears and kisses on both sides. I hope the kisses part will come true and that we may miss the quarrel and the tears. I was much amused with your account of Mrs Kelly as a hostess. I told my mother that part of your letter about Ned Casey not being up to the mark for Mrs Kelly and she laughed fit to burst over it. How is it Laddie didn\u2019t see the bride? Was he also not up to the mark for the drawing room and was he left to a \u201ccarman\u2019s treat\u201d in the kitchen!! I\u2019m annoyed that John Duffy should think I wouldn\u2019t spend time with him. I never saw him in Hopkin\u2019s and am surprised he wouldn\u2019t speak himself if he saw me. Was the Mrs with him at the time or was he alone? Sorry to hear Johnnie is still without news. Must close now as there is one of the men at my elbow waiting to see me. I send you my warmest love as usual and wish I could show it in a more practical and satisfying way than on paper.\u000ayour devoted lover for ever and ever\u000aJames

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aDespite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which we

Vhope for final forgiveness, it is true and I love and revere my dear and darling all the more if possible when I know that nearly a year ago she already had regard for me. As to your being a cool customer as you say, I know very well now from what you tell me that you are not. I\u2019m glad to hear that you are thinking of the races. Mrs Seery was asking me would I come down for them but I said I wasn\u2019t sure, not thinking that you would be likely to go. I hope you will go and maybe you\u2019d think of inviting me too. I know Mrs S would be only too delighted to give me lodging for the few days if you wouldn\u2019t be too hard-hearted to refuse to let me come down. Please do let me come down to see you then. I\u2019m breaking my promise already not to speak about coming down again until you mentioned it so I won\u2019t say any more now. You know very well....

Vand have been, I feel like the dirt when I imagine it possible that a prize such as you are could ever love me. I remember the roses you wore that day very well as I remember your dress and everything you said and did but I have only a very faint recollection of having picked up the rose for you. Probably I did it mechanically as an act of politeness without thinking there was any special significance in it. If you had given me the rose instead of my restoring it to you, I could have remembered it forever. The clearest thing I remember about the whole day is that I was furiously jealous of Ray (the best man) all day especially as you laughed and joked with him. I remember thinking that it was only natural you should prefer a man younger and better looking than me and I half made up my mind there and then to throw up the prize. That was while we were up the hill. Later on when we were playing the cards you sat beside me and I plucked up a bit of spirits again but on the whole thinking over the whole day\u2019s events afterwards I was inclined to think my chances were very poor. \u000aOne or two little things that happened during my holidays in August gave me hope, once or twice you allowed your hand to remain in mine when we shook hands and more especially your handshake the day I said goodbye that time. I was bursting to speak to you then but I got no chance and I never had so bad a heartache as leaving you then, not knowing whether to hope or despair. All that is over and done with now, thank God, and I need hardly say how I will cherish your dear sweet gift and mark of love. You needn\u2019t tell me not to do away with it. Do you think I\u2019m mad to do such a thing? I doubt very much if you will ever get it back again unless you insist on it. Don\u2019t think that is said as a joke or to flatter you. As I hope for

Vtold me that he thought there was somebody praying for me. I suppose he was surprised that such a \u201cbad egg\u201d would ever otherwise have the courage to go to confession. So I think you\u2019re going to be my guardian angel for I\u2019m sure the poor chap that got that thankless job when I was born has given up on me in despair long ago.\u000aI was delighted to get your letter this morning and especially with the contents. The lock of hair is going with the other treasures. As regards the photo I\u2019m sure I can\u2019t imagine who the very plain looking girl with the baby is. I don\u2019t think I could have ever seen her anyway. The poor thing will be quite offended if she hears that you have been sending her photo all round the country for strange men to make remarks about her (bow-wow). I\u2019ll keep the photo anyhow for a few days and will give it back to you (if you want it) when I see you. Perhaps by that time I will have discovered the identity of the lady!! As regards going down to see you I\u2019d prefer next Saturday to any other because for one thing it would break the miserable wait till Easter more evenly than going later on but if you want to go to the races I could defer it till then or preferably I could go down then also. But if the races are on the 10th or 17th April I\u2019d rather go now. I wouldn\u2019t mind deferring my visit till the 3rd April if the races were then but if they are later I want to go now. For one thing I want to see you so much and for another I\u2019m a bit cleaner in spirit than the last time I saw you and could look you in the face and kiss you with less compunction than on my previous visit. \u000aThe concert was a huge success as I told you. The Miss O\u2019Connor who played the harp was not one of the O\u2019Connors you met. We must go and hear the harp played some time a good player is performing. She wasn\u2019t much so you didn\u2019t miss a lot. About Killarney I don\u2019t care one way or another and the same as regards the day\u201d Thursday for losses\u201d doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019d face anything with you by my side, my darling girl, and the only thing I shouldn\u2019t like is \u201cno day at all\u201d .Will you let me know in your note about the date of the races and if it is later than the 3rd April please let me come down next Saturday. Will write you again tomorrow. I send you my warmest and dearest love\u000aYour ever loving \u000aJames

V39 Belgrave Square\u000aRathmines\u000aDublin\u000a22/3/1916\u000aMy dearest May,\u000aI have started to write this at home on Tuesday at very near midnight and will finish it on Wednesday. The letter I sent you today (Tuesday) was I fear a bit abrupt at the end. Duffy (you remember meeting him here) called in to go to dinner with me and I had to close it up rather hurriedly. If I left it over till the evening I would probably have missed the post. About this watch I am sorry that it is not giving satisfaction. O\u2019Leary in Hopkins told me when I bought it that all watches of the kind are a bit flighty at the start and he asked me to tell you to let him see this watch the next time you were in town in order to have it tested again. I shall call and see him

Vand tell him about it. If you like I could take it back with me when returning to town after my next visit (Saturday next I hope) and I could bring it down to you at Easter. Please yourself though in that respect. As it will be so short now until you are here for good (my good) perhaps you would like to wait till then. I don\u2019t see any reason why it shouldn\u2019t keep good time all right because it was tested beforehand for three days and was then all right. I\u2019m glad to hear you are so fond of it (I hope for my sake). You will see by my other letter that I am anxious to go down either this week end or next. \u000aIf you decide to let come down this week end, I am half inclined to come down on Saturday morning by the 9:15 from Broadstone (11:15 at Castletown) so as to have the day with you. The other train is later and I have to change at Mullingar but perhaps it would be inconvenient for you for me to come on the early train as Saturday is generally a busy day in every house and besides you might be going to Mullingar and might prefer to meet me there and be home with me. I\u2019ll leave it all to you as well as the decision whether I come next Saturday or Saturday week. If you say next Saturday let me know by return which trains I am to come on and whether I am to meet you at Mullingar.\u000aIt will be delightful to have the details of the marriage to talk over and to be able to settle things once and for all. If you don\u2019t care for Killarney it\u2019s easy to go somewhere else. I\u2019ll make enquiries about other places down south and we can go to one of them and perhaps drop in at Killarney for a day or two on our way home. I don\u2019t mind where I go so long as you go with me. As regards the dress I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m a poor guide as to either colour or make although I could tell you all right whether I liked a dress or not. I was at last Mass on

If I had thought of your interest in St Joseph I should have been more attentive.\u000aJudging by the papers, you had a nice row down in Tullamore on Monday night. I suppose you have heard all about it by this. There must be a queer crowd of rowdy element there when such things can happen. I was at another concert last night run by Cope for his choir. Nora is going to him for singing lessons hence my presence at it. I\u2019m sending you the programme in case you might be interested. It was very good all round but nobody we know was performing.

VNational Health Commission (Ireland)\u000aPembroke House\u000aUpper Mount Street\u000aDublin\u000a23/3/1916\u000aMy darling May\u000aI was overjoyed to get your letter this morning telling me that I may go down for the weekend to see you. I am writing Mrs Seery now to ask for lodgings but I don\u2019t know yet whether you will let me go on the early train on Saturday or on the evening train. When you have decided that point you might please let Mrs Seery know so that she may know when to expect me. It\u2019s really not a vital matter with me as if I don\u2019t go early Saturday I shall take an extra day instead probably Tuesday as I shall stay Monday in any case but of course naturally the sooner I see you the sooner I shall be happy. Until I see you I shall as usual be eating my heart out and one\u2019s heart is very unsatisfying diet. About the photo I\u2019ll bring it down with me. Of course I was only joking about the plain looking girl as I know very well it is yourself and I could hardly think you plain looking since I love you so much! I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite fair of you to try to pretend it is someone else. I haven\u2019t shown it around the house at home so you needn\u2019t be afraid on that score. I wrote to you on Sunday early in reply to your letter enclosing the cherished rose and posted it myself before 4 o\u2019clock long before post hour so you should have it on Monday.  The bould Paddy is to blame I\u2019m quite sure especially if it bears the Ballinea postmark 4:30 am on Monday. About Ray and the jealousy I was interested in the account of the happenings on the hill. I don\u2019t blame poor Ray for talking silly. I\u2019d do it myself only I\u2019m more given perhaps to self-repression. I don\u2019t think you are quite fair in thinking me backward or seemingly indifferent that day. It\u2019s a long day since I have been indifferent to you although you\u2019re inclined to think

VI\u2019m only telling you that to please you. I\u2019m afraid you don\u2019t yet understand my attitude of mind to you for a good while past. \u000aI half suspect Mrs Seery must have guessed how I felt towards you because whenever your name cropped up she used to mention what age you were and so on. For instance I remember very well her having told me several times you were not yet 19 and I remember how I used internally to say \u201cO Lord, put her out of your head, you d.. fool\u201d I could hardly think anything else when I considered our relative ages and your extreme youth. For all these reasons I have always been inclined to stand out of the running where you were concerned and to give you a fair field when younger and better men were concerned. For example, I remember somebody remarking last year in connection with Josie Duffy\u2019s marriage that one of the Casey boys might fix a covetous eye on you at the wedding and I thought to myself that it would be a shame for me to stand in the way of your happiness if such came to pass.\u000aAny of the Casey boys that I met would have been a much more suitable and probably a much better husband for you than I could ever hope to be. All these considerations restrained me and made me seem backward. I always wanted you to have the chance of seeing the merits of the better men and although it would have cost me many a heartache I\u2019d have been contented to see you married to somebody else if I was sure you preferred him to your humble servant, (servant in every sense I hope). I\u2019m afraid I have nothing more to say at the present except that I look forward to seeing you on Saturday. Be sure to let Mrs Seery know what train to expect me on. From what I have just told you I suppose it is unnecessary to repeat my love or to send you any special loving message now. I have loved you for many a day, May darling, and I hope we live together in ever increasing love and harmony for a good many years to come. I have no fears now that you will fail in your love and devotion but I distrust myself always. I kiss my dear girl\u2019s sweet face many times and send her my love.\u000aJames

O'Mahoney (drunkenness and absence)\u000aPrivate Ryan\u000a   "      Sweeney P.

Monteith was the commander of the Irish Brigade, appointed by Casement. \u000a\u000aCasement was in total in Germany attempting to secure German support for an uprising in Ireland and raising an ultimately unsuccessful brigade of Irish soldiers in German prisoner of war camps. By April 1916, he had become become disillusioned with German assistance and marginalized from the plans for the Rising. He believed there should be no rising without sufficient German support and when he realised that it was going ahead with only a small supply of German arms, he travelled to Ireland to prevent it from taking place.

Quinlisk was a member of the Irish Brigade, a brigade established by Casement from Irish prisoners in German prisoner of war camps. Quinlisk refers to events events at Zossen, Germany, from the 18 of November, and refers to men found drunk and punished for the offence. He had previously been put on trial with Dowling and others for an offence related to money. Despite being officers in the Irish Brigade, the men were tried as prisoners of war and this prompted angry exchanges between Casement and the Germans. Quinlisk complains that since he returned to the camp he has had his pass removed even though his only crime was the one he had previously been punished for. He also expresses his desir

Men have been absent, and found drunk in Zossen, and this morning five men were punished with arrest. Since I and Dowling rejoined the Corp we have assisted the Underofficer in every way, but notwithstanding the fact that the only crime against us was the one for which we were punished, the Oberleutnant has most unfairly deprived us of our passes. Sir, I wish to God we could go at once to Egypt. I have heard from Kehoe, he says he is sure of at least thirty men, I hope he will get them and that they will be as good as our last arrival, Wilson.\u000aHoping, Sir, you are in good health\u000aI remain yours obediently & respectfully\u000aTA.Quinlisk, Coms.\u000aP.S. Can Pte. Dooley's statement in American newspapers not be refuted. This Dooley was in my Regiment and Coy. and is a notable blackguard, always in the Guard-room\u000aT.A.Quinlisk

VLetter from Lord Wimborne (Ivor Churchill Guest), 1873-1939, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland 1915-1918, to Sir John Maxwell, (1859-1929), who was primarily responsible for government policy in the immediate aftermath of the Rising. The Rising began on 24 April 1916. Maxwell was appointed commander-in chief and arrived in Ireland on 28 April - the rebels surrendered on 29 April. In this letter Wimborne expresses his pleasure at the 'good progress and effective action' reported by Maxwell. The letter refers to an enclosed communique which seems to suggest a certain line of action, based on previous action in which the writer was involved.\u000a\u000aIt also indicates that the Lord Chancellor provided a plan of the Four Courts which shows the position of a building in which contained 'all the most valuable historical and proprietory documents in Ireland'.\u000a\u000aA post script indicates that the letter was delivered in person by Basil Blackwood (Basil Temple Blackwood), (1870-1917), private secretary to the lord lieutenant.

VThe letter is from John Sweetman (1844-1936) to Herbert Moore Pim (1883-1950). Sweetman was a member of Sinn Féin and patron to Arthur Griffith. In 1915 he spoke out against conscription and was arrested in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising. Pim was a political activist and writer. He had joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914, published a pamphlet series entitled 'Tracts of our times', including writing by Patrick Pearse, and in early 1916 founded the literary and political monthly, 'The Irishman'.\u000a\u000aSweetman refers to Sinn Fein politics in the aftermath of the Easter Rising, inquiring as to whether the 'Sinn Fein Bank' could get any help from the Irish National Aid fund and remarking that Sinn Fein could bring in a number of financial systems, including a bond, in the future, although the idea makes people laugh now. He also refers to the latest issue of  'The Irishman', founded by Pim. He asks whether James Stephens (1800?-1950), who had published a famous account of the Rising, and Stephen McKenna may take an

When I saw Alderman Thomas Kelly I thought he was not inclined to do anything, but he said he was to <del>have</del>be at a meeting that evening which would consider the question.\u000aI made no suggestion about the Sinn Féin Bank, but I wonder whether they could get any help from the Irish National Aid fund. I did not like to say anything about the matter as I always refused to have anything to say to the loan bank.\u000aI was pleased with this week's "The Irishman" and when in Dublin bought several copies to distribute. By the way I wonder whether James Stephens would take an interest in Sinn Féin. From reading his graphic account of the Insurrection in Dublin published by Maunsel I think he is inclined that way. Then there is Stephen McKenna. I think you agree with me a new Sinn Féin League should not attempt

It also refers Sir John Griffith and his son, former and current chief engineers at Dublin Port and to potato blight which had set in in Connacht, suggesting reducing the export of foodstuffs and sending them to the West of Ireland instead.

I am issuing five little <lb/> tracts at once, price <gap/>; and instructions for the formation of <lb/> clubs will be published in the next issue. Belfast is at work, <lb/> and has <del>conrad</del> secured suitable premises. I see you refer to <lb/> <hi rend="underline">Mr.</hi> John W.

And could you <lb/> communicate with him on my behalf? He might be inclined to <lb/> write me at your suggestion. I see in this Sinn Fein revival <lb/> a safety valve for national aspiration, which will prevent internal <lb/> disturbance and dissention, and will avoid invincible methods. </p> <p> I think the Coal question, the Harbour Board question <lb/> and the coming potato famine in Connacht are the most important at the <lb/> moment.

VThe letter is from John Sweetman (1844-1936) to Sir John Purser Griffith (1848-1938). Sweetman was a member of Sinn Féin and patron to Arthur Griffith. In 1915 he spoke out against conscription and was arrested in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising. Griffith has been chief engineer at the Dublin Port and Dock Board but took early retirement in 1912. He has been knighted in 1911 and later became a member of Seanad Eireann.\u000a\u000aIt is a request to Griffith on behalf of poltical activist and editor of 'The Irishman', Herbert Moore Pim (1883-1950). Sweetman has written an article which is due to appear in a forthcoming edition of 'The Irishman' in which he mentions a rumour that Sir John Griffith's son resigned his position as engineer-in-chief of the Dublin Port and Docks board.  He is requesting that Sir John Griffith contact Pim on the subject.

VLetter from John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres (1852-1925), commander of all British forces on home service, 1916-1918,  to Sir John Maxwell (1859-1929). Maxwell was appointed commander-in-chief of the British forces in Ireland during the Easter Rising and was primarily responsible for government policy in its immediate aftermath.\u000a\u000aReferring to Maxwell's letter of 1 May, French notes with pleasure the progress of events in Ireland but expresses caution where it comes to the 'disposal' of the 'Sinn Féiners' (the British used this term to describe militant nationalists although Sinn Féin were not involved in the Rising) who are not to be severely punished.\u000a\u000aFrench expresses surprise at the 'comparatively small amount of damage in Dublin' and refers in detail to the executions of the leaders, the first three of whom had been shot that morning, and the sentence to Countess Constance Markievicz (1868-1927), who fought under Michael Mallin during the Rising but whose death sentence was later commuted

VThis letter is from nationalist politician and nationalist MP T.M. Healy (1855-1931) Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond Fitzgerald (1888-1947).\u000a\u000aDesmond FitzGerald had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aMabel was particularly active in attempting to secure the release of her husband, who had not taken an active part in the actual fighting, and in highlighting the treatment of prisoners. Healy writes that attempts had been made to improve conditions and the removal of martial law (imposed after the outbreak of the rebellion) would facilitate this process. He states that he will keep her husband's case in mind and expresses the hope that a general amnesty for prisoners would come soon.

VThis is a letter from Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947).\u000a\u000aDesmond FitzGerald had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aMabel was particularly active in attempting to secure the release of her husband, who had not taken an active part in the actual fighting. In the letter, she points out the Desmond was a non-combatant and had been in prison until shortly before the Rising and so could have had no part in the planning of the rebellion. She also requests political prisoner status for those sentenced to penal servitude.

He was arrested at home on Wed. 10th May.\u000aAs Mr.Fitzgerald was in Mountjoy Prison from October last till within three weeks of the Rebellion on a sentence of six months for a Nationalist speech he had made here at Bray it is obvious that he would have had no share in plans for the Rebellion.\u000aAs, therefore, he was neither responsible for it, nor took a prominent <del>deleted text</del> or even a belligerent part in it, his sentence is quite disproportionately severe even among sentences which are all harsh, and I shall be grateful if you will bear the above facts in mind and if opportunity arises will press his claim to a proper trial with a view to revision of the sentence in accordance with the evidence, or will take whatever other action you think suitable, recognising however that my husband while welcoming inquiry into his case, does not in any wise disassociate himself from his friends whom circumstances placed in the position of combatants.\u000aI am,\u000aYours faithfully,\u000aMabel W.Fitzgerald\u000aP.S. It would give great satisfaction generally in Ireland if conditions of political imprisonment could be obtained for the prisoners sentenced to terms of Penal Servitude; at least they might be permitted to keep their own clothes.

He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aAnna O'Rahilly was a sister of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly ('The O'Rahilly') (1875\u20131916). Both O'Rahilly and FitzGerald had been supportive of attempts to stop the Rising taking place but joined in once it has started. O'Rahilly was killed in Moore Lane on Thursday of Easter week.\u000a\u000aThe letter refers to a bicycle borrowed by FitzGerald to get to the GPO on the first day of the Rising. Anna enquires about its possible whereabouts on behalf of O'Rahilly's wife. A note dated March 1992, probably by Mabel, explains what happened to the bicycle.

VThis letter is from politician and lawyer John Muldoon MP (1865-1938) to Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947).\u000a\u000aDesmond FitzGerald had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aMabel was particularly active in attempting to secure the release of her husband, who had not taken an active part in the actual fighting and Muldoon offers his support. He writes that the prisoners should all be released withing six months (a general amnesty did not take place until 1917) and the sentences were unjust as, in cases like FitzGerald's, the prisoners had been given no opportunity to defend themselves and call witnesses.

VThis letter is from Irish Parliamentary Party leader and MP John Dillon (1851-1927) to his mother in law Lady Elizabeth Mathew (d. 1933). This is a 110 page letter written between 25 April (the second day of the Rising) and 1 May 1916 recounting events in during the Rising. The letter contains fascinating detail about the events in Dublin including those experienced by Dillon himself as well as news, reports, rumours and gossip given to Dillon by family and colleagues. Dillon was the only Irish Parliamentary Party leader in Dublin during the Rising and spent the week confined to his house in North Great George's Street, a short distance from the rebel headquarters in the GPO. He went on to denounced the execution of the leaders in Westminster in a now famous speech on 11 May 1916.

Wimborne was lord lieutenant of Ireland and Sir John Maxwell had been appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written after the suppression of the Rising and two days before the first executions of the leaders. Wimborne praises Maxwell for the 'complete success' of his forces in suppressing the Rising, expresses appreciation for the measures adopted by General Lovick Friend, whom Maxwell had replaced, and desribes the conduct of the officers and men as 'admirable' and deserving of the 'fullest recognition'. A note on the letters tells that the contents were published for the information of the troops.

VThe letter is from journalist and unionist Robert John Lynn (1873-1945) to Sir John Maxwell (1859-1929).\u000a\u000aMaxwell had been appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland during the Easter Rising and was responsible for the suppression of the Rising. A staunch unionist and later MP for Belfast West and Antrim North, Lynn served as editor and assistant editor of the 'Northern Whig' newspaper.\u000a\u000aLynn writes to Maxwell about a rumour that the arms of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), established to defend Ulster from the imposition of Home Rule, would be seized. In April 1914 the UVF had landed about twenty-five thousand rifles and between three and five million rounds of ammunition at Larne and Lynn argues that to seize these arms would be 'frought with grave danger to the public peace'. He notes that unionists had behaved 'splendidly' during the period of the Rising and as the 'flower' of the UVF had signed up to fight in World War I any seizure of arms would be 'looked upon as an act of treachery

VThe letter is from Sir Ivor Churchill Guest, Lord Wimborne (1873-1939) to Sir John Grenfell Maxwell (1859-1929). Wimborne was lord lieutenant of Ireland and Sir John Maxwell had been appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising.\u000a\u000aThe letter was written in the aftermath of the Rising and on the day of the first executions of the leaders. It primarily concerns the issue of martial law. Wimborne had introduced martial law on 25 April, the second day of the Rising, and writes that the original documentation allowed it to be continued for one month. He notes that it would be possible to extend this if necessary. In a postscript Wimborne refers to the attorney general and the 'laudable task' of seizing arms from volunteer organisations (such the Irish Volunteers and the Ulster Volunteers Force).

VThis is an undated letter from Éamon de Valera (1882-1975) to his wife, Sinéad de Valera (, written around April or May 1916. De Valera was one of the leaders of the 1916 Rising. His command was the area around Boland Mills. De Valera's battalion was one of the last to surrender. He was first incarcerated in Ballsbridge. By the time he was transferred to Richmond Barracks most of the court marshals of the other leaders, and several of the executions, had taken place. De Valera was court-martialled, convicted, and sentenced to death on 10 May , but the sentence was immediately commuted to penal servitude for life.\u000a\u000aThe letter may have been written from Boland's Mills before the surrender, or after his arrest but before his sentence was commuted. He says 'if I die' suggesting that he either expected to die in battle or was unsure about whether a death sentence would be passed.

VSir John Maxwell (1859 - 1929), primarily responsible for government policy in the immediate aftermath of the Rising. Maxwell was in sole charge of trials and sentences by "field general court martial", which was trial without defence or jury and in camera. He had 3,400 people arrested, 183 civilians tried, 90 of whom were sentenced to death. Fifteen were shot between 3-12 May.\u000a\u000aLord French, 1st Earl of Ypres (1852 - 1925), commander of all British forces on home service, 1916-1918. Maxwell requests that the training of the 59th Division (2nd North Midland)* continue as soon as possible. He writes about moving Brigades to Straffan Camp and Glen of Imaal for musketry and firing practice. He asks for Lord French's assistance in moving some of the Artillery of the Division, currently held up in Liverpool.\u000a\u000aFinally, in a handwritten postscript  Maxwell says he is a little perplexed as to what to do with 'this man McNeill' (Eoin MacNeill 1867-1945). He says MacNeill was prominent in the movement but he tried to st

I generally go to bed about 10 o ck &amp; get up and go for walk which is most necessary on night duty unfortunately these last few days I have not been able to as my feet have been very bad &amp; I am great afraid &amp; sorry to have to say, I am going very flat footed. Matron who is a dear saw me about them yesterday &amp; says I had better get supports which I hope to do when I come off night duty &amp; have time to go<pb/>

Vinto Valletta&#x2014; I am at present doing Swedish exercising with my trio. My Sister (Trowers) very kindly massaged them yesterday which made them much better, she says it is partly Rheuma<lb/> tic & that the foot has gone fairly flat. Sister Trowers I am sorry to say is off night duty &amp; we have a horrible common one instead. I am glad to say Matron is taking me off after the month as she does not approve of V A D s being on longer &#x2014; Matron is charming & her one delight is to see every one happy &#x2014; She is going to put me in Sisters Trowers ward when I go on day duty &#x2014; so I expect to have a nice month before we go home &#x2014; I do not know what is going to happen to us, the last lot of VADs went on Friday, it did make us all feel home sick. Ah but two of those who have signed on again were sent home <del>expect</del> so it looks like as if they are keeping very few on in Malta &#x2014;<pb/>

VJohn Dillon (1851-1927) Served as a Member of Parliament for over 35 years and was the last leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party. By political disposition Dillon was an advocate of Irish nationalism. He was involved in May 1916 with Lloyd George\u2019s futile attempt to implement Home Rule after the Rising, which failed in July on the issue of the exclusion or not of Ulster.\u000a\u000aSir John Maxwell (1859 - 1929) was primarily responsible for government policy in the immediate aftermath of the Rising. Maxwell was in sole charge of trials and sentences by "field general court martial", which was trial without defence or jury and in camera. He had 3,400 people arrested, 183 civilians tried, 90 of whom were sentenced to death. Fifteen were shot between 3-12 May.\u000a\u000aIn this letter Dillon welcomes the fact that Maxwell has enlisted the services of Captain Crean who is aware of the National Volunteers and can help with the cases Dillon has sent to him.

VMarie writes some news that she heard about her brother, Charlie, who is who is missing-in-action.  Charlie is a soldier with the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who was fighting on the  Salonika front. She has just received the news from someone who was part of his regiment.  He told her that Charlie had suffered a wound to his shoulder and in the letter to her mother, Marie expresses her concern for his welfare.  She also describes the conditions in the hospital for a V.A.D and she mentions how excited she is about going home and seeing her mother.

Asquith served as the Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916.\u000a\u000aMaxwell opens by advising Asquith that the name of the Bishop of Cork is Dr. Daniel Cohalan, (1858-1952). Dr.Cohalan was later an outspoken critic during the Irish War of Independence, condemning acts of violence on both sides.\u000a\u000aThe letter is a response to questions arising from the killing of Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878-1916), a pacifist.\u000a\u000aAt the time of writing Maxwell doesn't know the identity of the military officer who was present at the arrest of Sheehy Skeffington but he makes a point to say that it was not Captain Bowen Colthurst (1880-1966). Colthurst was, in fact, responsible for the arrest, on 25 April 1916, of Francis Sheehy Skeffington and two others and

VThis letter is from a brigadier-general on the general staff of the British army in Ireland, writing on behalf of Sir John Grenfell Maxwell (1859-1929) to William Henry Brayden (1865-1933) the editor of the 'Freeman's Journal'.\u000a\u000aMaxwell was commander-in-chief of the British forces in Ireland and primarily responsible for government policy in the immediate aftermath of the Easter Rising. The offices of the 'Freeman' were destroyed during the Rising and Braydon was replaced soon after this letter was written. \u000a\u000aThe letter complains about a number of articles which appeared in the 'Freeman's Journal', a nationalist newspaper, which he claims were aimed at criticising martial law and fostering sympathy for those who took up arms, or plotted to do so, during the Rising. It explains that articles of that nature will not be tolerated and action may be taken under the Defence of the Realm Act.\u000a\u000aThe writer acknowledges that a number of innocent people have been detained but adds that 'flamboyant and incendiary languag

VHeadquarters, Irish Command, Parkgate, Dublin.\u000a14th May, 1916.\u000aSir,\u000aI am directed by the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief to inform you that his attention has been drawn to several articles that have appeared recently in your paper, the purpose of which appears to be to criticise and bring into contempt the administration of Martial Law in this country and to foster sympathy for those who have taken up arms, or plotted to do so, against His Majesty's Troops.\u000aI am to inform you that the publication of such sentiments cannot be tolerated and that the appearance of any further articles of this nature in any newspaper under your control will render you liable to immediate action being taken under the provisions of the Defence of the Realm Act.\u000aThe General Officer Commanding-in-Chief is well aware that the suppression of the rising inevitably entailed the regrettable arrest and detention of a certain number of persons who neither encouraged nor took part in the rebellion or in the preparations for same. These cases are being investigated with all possible dispatch and though some time may elapse before all the innocent persons can be liberated, Press comments dwelling upon and emphasising in flamboyant and incendiary language any such cases of hardship and injustice can but have a prejudicial effect upon the peace of the country which it is the object of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief  to restore as speedily as possible.\u000aI have the honour to be,\u000aYour obedient Servant\u000aR.H.\u000aBrigadier General, General Staff.\u000aTo The Editor, Freeman's Journal, Dublin.

VLetter from Sir John Grenfell Maxwell (1859-1929) to  John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres (1852-1925), commander of all British forces on home service. Maxwell had been appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising was primarily responsible for government policy in its immediate aftermath. He was in sole charge of trials and sentences by \u2018field general court martial\u2019.\u000a\u000aThis letter refers primarily to the suppression of the Rising.\u000a\u000aMaxwell refers to an 'intemperate and groundless' speech made by John Dillon MP (1851-1927). This is likely Dillon's demands for an end to executions in the House of Commons on 10 and 11 May 1916. He further discusses debate in the House and in the media. Maxwell admits that there have been 'one or two regrettable incidents', particularly the killing of pacifist Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878 \u2013 1916) by Captain Bower Colthurst, but remarks that in general the men had behaved with \u2018commendable moderation

The Irish Constabulary is a farce, a magnificent body of men certainly, but singularly out of sympathy with the people, and centralised in the North.\u000aIn my opinion you will never rule Ireland from Dublin Castle, there is far too much reporting & nothing happening, because no one has authority to act on even trivial things, which ought to be settled out of hand.\u000aOne thing all Irishmen seem to know & that is law, and if one does not watch it, they catch you out at once.\u000aI ought to pop over & see my sick wife but I can't see my way to, unless I can escape on Saturday & return Sunday.\u000aSincerely\u000aJ.G.Maxwell

VMarie Martin (1892\u20131975) joined the Voluntary Aid Detachment (VAD) upon the outbreak of World War 1. During her time as a VAD in Malta, and at the Battle of the Somme in France, she regularly wrote to her mother Mary Martin (1866-1955) in Dublin. In her letters, she tended to describe her day to day duties as a VAD, her patients and trips she would take on her days off.  \u000a\u000aIn this letter, Marie begins by describing her ailments to her mother.  She is suffering from diarrhoea and her face is swollen from insect bites.  She discusses the number of patients she is caring for and some of her day to day duties as a VAD in Malta.

VIn this letter, Marie writes to tell her mother that she has recovered from her illness.  She describes her living arrangements in the hospital and her attempts to make her room more homely by adding items such as a hanging plant.  She also writes about the working conditions and mentions that the nurses are run off their feet and are finding it difficult to give the patients the care that they require.

This is a very rough idea of the work but it is very hard to explain the staff we have is a Sister in Charge whose whole time is giving up looking around, giving medicines & going round with Dr. & writing out diet sheet. 3 Sisters 3 V.A.D for 140 Patients mostly with  acute Dysentry & bad enteric so you can imagine how we have to work ever to get finish, of course we have abut 6 orderlys on in the morning & 3 afternoon & evening with 4 of us for the whole block. However so long as we can keep going & doing our best  it is all that can be expected of us. If the Matron only asked for more & explained how badly off we <sic>we</sic> are we would be sure to get more but she is  much too frighten & does not realize the work no one can unless they have to do it themselves. The poor men come in with the most terrible broken backs

I could not explain to you all they have to go through & all we have to do, everything is luck here so I can only trust in the Lord that all may go well -\u000aI sincerely hope this awful Illness will soon pass away, it puts so many  fine men out of action do you know that nearly all the Hospitals  on the Island  are medical cases all the wounded are being sent home as soon as possible as they do not find wounds heal well here, the blue sisters are very full & they have cases of wounded. Very funny the other day I went to Benediction at the S.Heart Convent & while I was there they told me a Miss Mortimer was living there & nursing at the Blue Sisters, so I went up to see her thinking it was Mabel the girl I was at school with it turned out to be a sister, Mabel is in London working or studying as an artist.\u000aThe Matron has just been to see me &

VThis letter is from Maurice Bonham Carter to a Mr Hutchison.\u000a\u000aIt encloses a telegram received from Sir Edward Grey's private secretary. Grey (1862-1933), was British foreign secretary between 1905 and 1916. The message states that the Prime Minister, Herbert Henry Asquith (1852-1928), cannot give an interview but he suggests that Sir John Maxwell (1859-1929) might do so. Maxwell had been appointed commander in chief of the British forces in Ireland after the outbreak of the Easter Rising and was primarily responsible for government policy in its immediate aftermath. He was in sole charge of trials and sentences by \u2018field general court martial\u2019.\u000a\u000aBonham Carter sets out the procedure for the interview and suggests that Hutchison enlist the assistance of Berry (believed to be an American Correspondent staying at the Gresham Hotel).\u000a\u000aCarter wants to counteract the negative feeling in America (over the executions) and makes a number of suggestions as to what the journalist might include in the piece.\u000a\u000aFinally

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him.\u000a\u000aDespite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were

The weather these days makes you long for holidays and to be able to get away from the treadmill of the office especially when you know what pleasure and happiness await you if you could only manage to get the liberty.\u000aHowever it's not long now till Easter next Thursday fortnight and it won't be long passing and six weeks after that will be the day of days. I'll start marking them off day by day from this on like I used to do at school and I'll keep my heart warm and my hopes up in the meantime. I'm sure I'll have a lovely time at Easter and on the whole I'm not sorry that you are not anxious to go to the races. I'd be bound to got down to them, nothing could keep me away and as I couldn't for shame sake spend another weekend in ?Leopardstown? so soon I'd only see you for a few minutes in a crowd and it would only increase my heartache rather than relieve it. It will be much better to have you up for a while than that and I feel like hugging you now ( I wish I could!!) for being such a dear good little girl as to agree to come up. My mother will be delighted to have you for as long as you'll stay, sure it's hardly worth your while going back and your own little man will worship you and the ground you stand on all the time. By the way when I come down at Easter I'd like to bring you something just to show my love. Would you like anything special? How about a scarf or gloves or something of that sort. If you wish it, I can get Nora to help me buy and so you could be sure of the taste being all right, if I bought myself I'd probably make an awful mess of it. Nobody made an Aporil

Hope they're sowing plenty of spuds and oats because we might all have to live on them this year.

VThis telegraph was sent by a number of prominent Cork citizens to Sir Ivor Churchill Guest (1873-1939), 1st Viscount Wimborne, lord lieutenant of Ireland.\u000a\u000aThe message, which they believe voices the opinion of the 'vast majority of Citizens of Cork', requests an end to the executions and mass arrests that followed the suppression of the Easter Rising. They argue that to continue would have a 'most serious affect on the people' and be 'extremely prejudicial to the peace'. The letter came on the day that Thomas Kent was executed in Cork Detention Barracks for his part in the death of a policeman was killed after his family home was raided. Eleven men had been executed in Kilmainham Gaol and three more were executed in the following days.\u000a\u000aThe signatories to the message include Rev. Daniel Cohalan, later bishop of Cork and an outspoken opponent of IRA violence during the War of Independence, the lord mayor of Cork, the high sheriff of Cork and members of the United Irish League who were by then largely a fundrai

They also blame the Irish administration for the Rising due to their 'unpardonable laxity' and request that funds be supplied to compensate 'unoffending citizens' whose property was destroyed.

VThis is a letter from Thomas William Lyster (1855-1922), librarian at the National Library of Ireland, to Edward O'Farrell, assistant under-secretary for Ireland. Lyster writes in the hope of securing copies of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, read from the front of the General Post Office by Patrick Pearse and distributed in Dublin on the first day of the Rising, and 'Irish War News', a newspaper published by the rebels during the Rising lasting only one issue, for several libraries including the NLI. Lyster points out it will 'important for historical purposes' and that he has already had an expression of interest from the Welsh Library.\u000a\u000aA note on the letter by O'Farrell agrees with the letter and it was passed to 'G' Division, the detective branch of the Dublin Metropolitan Police, to secure copies. The enclosed minutes refer to attempts by the chief commissioner of the DMP to locate copies. It is noted that they had a copy of the bottom half (the proclamation was printed originally in two parts) t

VMarie opens this letter to her mother by saying how little time she has had to write due to the fact that the hospital is so understaffed.  She is clearly finding the work very hard and she refers to a patient of hers who had earlier died from dysentery and another who is very ill and she had written to his mother in Canada.  She also tells her mother trivial things such as how most of the patients on the blue ward wear blue pyjamas.  She takes a break from writing the letter and finishes on the 22nd November when she writes that her friend, Mr Boase, is returning to England and he will post the letter from there.

VMarie begins this letter to her mother by explaining that she had written her previous letter in a hurry and describes it as the "madest (sic) letter" she had ever written.  She mentions that they had experienced a terrible storm which meant that she could not go out on her day off and their accommodation had flooded.  The Canadian soldier whose mother Marie had mentioned writing to in her previous is improving and she is happy about this.  She describes a number of her patients and mentions a Wexford sailor called Richard who may call to her family once he has returned to Ireland.  She also mentions a trip to Valletta in a rowing boat.  Overall, her mood seems upbeat.

VMrs FitzGerald is querying the sentence imposed on her husband, Desmond FitzGerald, (1888-1947), politician, poet, and revolutionary. He was sentenced at Court-Martial to 20 years Penal Servitude, later reduced to 10 years.\u000a\u000aMrs FitzGerald protests as, she claims, while her husband was present in the G.P.O. during the fighting, he was a non-combatant. Furthermore, she writes, he wasn't involved in the planning of the Rising.

Had he been, he would not have been told <del>of</del>off to take women and <del>children</del>wounded to a place of safety when the <del>G.</del>G.P.O. was on fire.\u000aIt is obvious that when he was in Mountjoy Prison <sic>fr</sic>for a Speech from last October till within three weeks of the Rebellion he had no share in planning it. As, therefore, he was neither responsible for it, nor did he take a prominent or even a belligerent part in it, the sentence of 20 years can only have been passed by error, and that it was confirmed with remittance of only 10 years is evidence that the full facts of the case could not have been familiar t the General Officer Commanding in Chief.\u000aI am,\u000aYours faithfully\u000aMabel W.Fitzgerald

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were b

V13th April 1916\u000aMy dearest May,\u000aI was delighted to have your letter this morning not that you had very much news in it but I was glad to get it as showing that you had been thinking of me yesterday. I was telling the news about Louis at home and my mother was of course delighted to hear that he is getting fixed up at last. It seems to be quite the rage at present to get married. I had a letter from George Clitheroe last night from England

Vto say that he is going off next with Miss Willette, I suppose some English girl. I don\u2019t know whether you ever met him but Mrs Seery did and she will be interested to hear that he also as well as myself is losing the \u201cfreedom of the city\u201d so soon. He is at present on night work, he tells me, from 8 at night till 9 next morning and won\u2019t be able to get off even for a day for his wedding so he is earning his bit as well as doing it for his country. I am afraid you were all disappointed yesterday about Nora & Moll turning up as promised. Moll only went down to the country on Tuesday evening, goodness knows what kept her till then, and of course she wouldn\u2019t have been able to get out of Mrs Shiels on Wednesday and after that I suppose she had to go to Lisavra  to Moran\u2019s for a few hours anyhow. I hope they both turned up today for I know very well if they disappoint that Mrs Seery will be very mad over it. About Easter of course I\u2019m looking forward to it already and of course I must see you on Good Friday as well as every other day whether you like it or not. \u000aYou\u2019ll have to be promising to love honour and obey in a month or so now so you might as well be starting to get accustomed to it.

I suppose it is always invidious to make comparisons and besides I should like to live on good terms with my sisters-in-law but I must say that I\u2019m quite satisfied that I got the pick of the bunch. We talked over the question of the best man yesterday evening and I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t get over Pat Moran . I will break the news to Mrs Seery when I go down and I hope she will take it all right. Anyhow I can\u2019t please everyone and I suppose someone is bound to be vexed. We hear today that the eight hour day in the Civil Service is knocked on the head so that is so much to the good.\u000aNo other news.

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were b

I forgot whether I told you in my letter yesterday that the eight hour day has been knocked on the head so that is one small comfort although it is really very little relief one way or another to me. I have to get through the load some way or another whether it takes seven hours a day or no. I have really no news at all and besides I must catch the post which leaves in about 20 minutes so will you please excuse me.\u000aI send you my warmest love and kisses (in spite of the heat)\u000aYour loving, James

I must face her whatever happens when I go down about the best man as I can\u2019t put it off any longer. I hope she will take it reasonable anyway.  \u000aI was sorry to see that you take me so seriously to heart although of course it flatters me very much. I thought I had enough on my conscience when I diddled you into agreeing to marry me but if I have in addition the load on my conscience of making you give up all your prayers and other good works I don\u2019t know what will become of me. I hope it won\u2019t be quite so bad as that and that you will be content to go and do the stations with me on Good Friday and be good and loving and sweet afterwards as you always otherwise are. Sometimes I don\u2019t know when you talk that way whether you are joking or not or whether you really do scruple being fond of me or kissing me with the freedom and frankness which is only reasonable in the case of us two. I don\u2019t see what harm you do even if you did think of me and love me on Good Friday as well as on any other day.

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were b

VMabel FitzGerald's husband Desmond FitzGerald, (1888-1947) had been arrested and detained at Richmond Barracks to await Court-Martial. W. Goodman writes that he was also arrested and had been put in a cell with Mr. FitzGerald. The latter asked him to write to Mabel to tell her how he was doing.\u000a\u000aGoodman reports that FitzGerald was in very good form - singing and sleeping well. They also discussed religion and politics and Goodman expresses great admiration for FitzGerald who he hopes will get out soon. He writes that he expects Fitzgerald will achieve a high position in life.

If I cannot make these arrangements fro him he will wish to do so himself and will require a further supply of money to be sent him in order to do so.\u000aI am anxious to know too if I may see him in the usual way before he is tried. If not I hope I may be informed at the first opportunity when I may see him, and that I shall be given sufficient time before the appointment to make the journey from here. I enclose a stamped Telegraph form which I hope the Governor of the Prison will use if occasion arises.\u000aI am forwarding under another cover to Kingstown where I have heard my husband will be, a small parcel containing handkerchiefs, collars, toothbrush and toothpaste; I hope that this parcel will be given him.\u000aHoping you will let me have the information I desire as soon as possible.\u000aI remain,\u000aYours truly,\u000aMabel W.Fitzgerald

VGladys Ruth Johnson (aged 26) was training to be a nurse at the Adelaide Hospital in Dublin at the time of the Easter Rising in 1916.  The hospital in Peter Street was close to the fighting and she writes about how the patients were moved to the cellars to keep them safe from the bullets.   The letter was written on May 15th 1916.   She describes how Jacobs Factory was occupied by 'Sinn Feinners' and they were give five chances to surrender because if the building had been blown up it would have meant damaging the hospital.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aGladys qualified as a nurse later in the year and then volunteered to work as a VAD in France nursing the troops.  She joined the Queen Alexandra's Medical Corps.  Her fiancée , Dr Percy Vickery, was in the Royal Medical Corps and was stationed in Egypt, Gallipoli and Palestine.  They married in June 1918 and subsequently moved to England and settled in Hampshire where Percy was a GP.

VA long letter from Patrick Blair Carphin to his sister Jo providing a general account of the aftermath of the Rising.  He describes the scene on Sackville Street with the flag of the Republic flying on the General Post Office; the inconvenience caused by the stoppage of the trams and the "rattle of machine guns" as they passed Trinity College.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aAs the letter continues, Patrick describes how as they were walking home, they were caught in some rifle fire.  His daughter, Doreen was shot in the leg, and he himself was shot in the ankle (by a used bullet).  A doctor from a nearby house brought them into his house to shelter until they could safely get to an ambulance.  It was only after the shock had subsided that Patrick's wife counted twelve different bullet holes in her clothing.

Vat an end". I said thanks there is no place like home &#x2014; no carts, no cars, no taxis, so with a bundle of eggs which we had gathered at Lusk we started to tramp home. On we went past Trinity College where the rattle of machine guns from the Castle made me hurry the party on. Up Grafton Street a friend of ours who has a Painters Shop in Stephens Green said "The best thing you can do is leave your parcells in my place till tomorrow &amp; then you'll have nothing to carry. This we did &amp; had resumed our homeward way when, from the Direction of Harcourt Street came a scurrying rush of men women &amp; children which I could not understand. We drew aside to get the shelter of a church porch as the crowd swept by when Doreen suddenly cried "Oh Mother I am shot" &amp; something (like a boy throwing a stone) hit he hard on the ankle. I never bothered about anything but picked Doreen up &amp; carried her back to where our parcels were (&amp; are still) reposing, there I cut her clothes off &amp; put an improvised tourniquet on her leg. She got a bullet (which I have in my pocked as I write) right through the upper part of her left leg, which providentially escaped the bone &amp; the femoral artery but cut a branch of the latter. Meantime a Doctor turned up from a few doors away &amp; said "you are not safe here come into my house" &amp; then we had to shelter for a time &amp; a quarter while rifle &amp; revolver shots made it unwise, to say the least of it, to open the door. Then we all bundled into an ambulance &amp; got home. I may add that if reports are true the Sinn Fein crowd have as much respect for the Red Cross as the Germans! Our own Doctor came shortly after &amp; found Doreen fearfully weak from shock &amp; loss of blood but pulled her round with whiskey &amp; Brand's essence &amp; now after an anxious time I am thankful to say

VDUBLIN CASTLE,\u000a4th March, 1916.\u000a\u000aDear Mr. Hanna,\u000aSir Matthew Nathan has asked me to return the letter which formed the second enclosure to yours of the 1st of March. He has looked at the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry which dealt with the case of Consta-ble Nicholas Rainsford, and has observed that the Conta-ble was defended before that Court by Counsel. The proceedings were scrutinised by the Attorney General who has advised that the Court could hardly have come to any other conclusions that those arrived at. In the circum-stances Sir Matthew regrets that there is noting to be done in the matter.\u000a\u000aYours Faithfully,\u000a\u000aT.J Hanna, Esq.,\u000aHouse of Commons,\u000aLondon.

V24, Buckingham Street,\u000aStrand. W.C.\u000a3rd March 1916.\u000aMr. Birbell.\u000aChief Secretary of State for Ireland.\u000aHouse of Commons. S.W.\u000aSir,\u000aI wish to place my services at the disposal of the government. For the last 25 years I have been controlling large bodies of people, as organiser of Exhibitions, Fetes, Theatrical and Variety Companies &c. &c. so am used to vast crowds of people, keeping them in order addressing them &c.\u000aMy business has taken me through nearly every town and village in Great Britain and Ireland as well as in S.Africa and Australia.\u000aI have been (till last Saturday) running some important Theatrical Ventures, but owing to the calling up of the young men, <hi rend="underline">both Artists and Audience</hi> I felt that my brains may be better employed in the service of my Country, where men with experience such as mine are rare, and might put to a more useful purpose during the Crisis.\u000aMy age is 46: my father was a distinguished Commander in the Royal Navy, who won the Legion of Honour during the Crimean War.\u000aDuring the early stages of this war, I gave recruiting speeches at various Theatres. At the Hippodrome, Stoke-on-Trent, I succeeded in getting 13 members of the audience to come on to the stage and enlist, whilst many others went to the Town Hall the following morning and enlisted also.\u000aI was a powerful speaker, a skilled organiser and possess a thorough knowledge of the British Temperament.\u000aIf you can make any use of my services, I will be glad of an early reply.

You will see by the particulars the amount payable on death of deceased is £9.12.0. I prepared the papers for administration with the will annexed on behalf of Mrs Kate Lavin and sent them to Mr. Concannon the Dist. Registrar Tuam(?), who found there was some difficulty in the matter as Mrs. Lavin was no relation of deceased. He laid the matter before the principal Registrars Dublin and i enclose the reply quoted in Mr. Concannon's letter to me of 24 February last. I got the affidavit <del>Mr Concannon</del> suggested by the Registrar sworn as to the previous history of the deceased of which I enclose a copy. In order to let the matter through and as the sum of money payable by the Insurance Co. on the death of deceased is so small. I will feel greatly obliged if you say that the Attorney General will not interfere.\u000aYour obedient servant,\u000aThomas Atwell\u000aThe Chief Crown Solicitor\u000aDublin Castle\u000aP.S.

She took out a Policy of Insurance on her life in 1914 a copy of the particulars which I enclose. She made her will on 24 November 1915 leaving the Policy to Mrs Kate Lavin. I enclose copy will. You will see by the particulars the amount payable on death of deceased is £9.12.0. I prepared the papers for administration with the will annexed on behalf of Mrs Kate Lavin and sent them to Mr. Concannon the Dist. Registrar Tuam, who found there was some difficulty in the matter as Mrs. Lavin was no relation of deceased. He laid the matter before the principal Registrars Dublin and i enclose the reply quoted in Mr. Concannon's letter to me of 24 February last. I got the affidavit <del>Mr Concannon</del> suggested by the Registrar sworn as to the previous history of the deceased of which I enclose a copy. In order to let the matter through and as the sum of money payable by the Insurance Co. on the death of deceased is so small. I will feel greatly obliged if you say that the Attorney General will not interfere.\u000aYour obedient servant,\u000aThomas Atwell\u000aThe Chief Crown Solicitor\u000aDublin Castle\u000aP.S. Mrs. Lavin's Sureties are the two witnesses to the will and are mercahants in Boyle. T.A.

VThis letter is from Sinéad deValera (1878-1975), teacher, writer and wife of Éamon deValera (1882 - 1975), to her mother Margaret Flanagan (née Byrne).\u000a\u000aThe letter was written while Éamon deValera was in prison in Dartmoor in England. He had commanded the rebel garrison at Boland's Mills during the Easter Rising but escaped execution, the only garrison commandant to do so.\u000a\u000aSinéad writes to tell her mother that 'Ed' (Éamon) has been imprisoned in Dartmoor and not to be troubled by events.\u000a\u000aShe outlines the prison's correspondence and visitation regime, adding that , even though letters are censored, Ed prefers them, as visits are closely supervised and unsatisfactory. She encloses a letter from him to her mother and assures her again of his good health.\u000a\u000aSinéad expresses the opinion that it was American influence (Éamon de Valera had been born in America) that lead to her husband's sentence being commuted from death to penal servitude for life.

VThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were b

VTThis is from a series of letters written between James Finn and his fiancée Mary (May) Fay. They became engaged in January 1916 and married in June. He lived in Dublin, she in Westmeath; he was 20 years older than her at 39 and had become acquainted with her during his regular visits to his relative Mrs Mary Seery, her neighbour. Throughout the series their relationship develops from the first somewhat tentative letters.\u000a\u000aThey were not to be married long: in 1919 he fell ill with the great flu epidemic, it led to heart damage and he died in 1922 as she was expecting their fourth child. She held on to his letters as her reminder of him. Despite many offers and her difficult finances she never married again. She took in lodgers and trained (and practised) as a midwife, chiropodist, and public health nurse while raising her children. She proved to be an excellent entrepreneur, charmed bank managers into giving her loans (against the norm of the time) and bought properties one after another, many of which were

VThis letter is from Éamon deValera (1882-1975) to his mother Catherine Wheelwright (née Coll) (1856-1932). De Valera had joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and went on to command the rebel forces at Bolands Mill during the Easter Rising. On surrender he was court-martialled and sentenced to death  but this was commuted to penal servitude for life. De Valera was born in America to an Irish mother and a Cuban man of Spanish descent and this, and the lateness of his trial, probably contributed to the reduction in sentence.\u000a\u000aHere de Valera is writing from Dartmoor Prison, England, to his mother in America.\u000a\u000aIn the letter he expresses regret at missing his half-brother, Fr Thomas Wheelwright's (1890-1946), ordination and first Mass.\u000a\u000aThe letter is mostly about de Valera's American connection and he asks his mother for information about his grandfather's family and business. He is looking for information to help establish his nationality.\u000a\u000aReferring again to Fr Tom's ordination, he comments that at least one son

VThis letter is from Catherine Wheelwright (née Coll) (1858-1932) to her son Fr Thomas Wheelwright (1890-1946). Catherine Wheelwright was the mother of \u000a\u000aÉamon de Valera (1882-1975), teacher, revolutionary and politician and Fr Wheelwright was her son and de Valera's half brother.\u000a\u000aShe writes from Rochdale, New York concerning the Easter Rising and Éamon's involvement. She tells of the various influential contacts she has made in America on his behalf.\u000a\u000aDe Valera was adjutant to the commandant of the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers, Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), and commanded the garrison at Boland's Mills. De Valera escaped execution for his part in the Rising and was the only garrison commandant to do so. By the time this letter was written de Valera had already escaped execution but was imprisoned in Dartmoor in England.

VThis letter is from Eoin MacNeill (1867-1945), to Éamon deValera (1882-1975). MacNeill was a founder of the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and, despite holding the post of chief-of-staff at the outbreak of the Easter Rising, he took no part in its planning. MacNeill was against a rising without a firm chance of success or without British provocation and once he learned of the plans for the Rising tried to prevent it.\u000a\u000aDe Valera (1882-1975) had joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913 and was adjutant to Thomas MacDonagh (1878-1916), Dublin Brigade commandant. He went on to command forces at Bolands Mill during the Rising and was the most senior participant to escape execution.\u000a\u000aIn this letter, sent on Easter Sunday on MacNeill's home, he issues a direct order to de Valera that no movement of Irish Volunteers is to take place that day. He also commands that the order be made known to other officers. The order was issued to de Valera as MacDonagh was 'not accessible'.\u000a\u000aMacNeill had put a notice in that day's 'Sunday Inde

VThis letter was written by J.J. (Seán) Heuston, (1891-1916) to Mr. Walsh, a colleague at the Great Southern and Western Railway in Kingsbridge Station, on the day before his execution at Kilmainham Gaol.\u000a\u000aHeuston was a leading member of Fianna  Éireann, a republican boy scout movement, and a founding member of the Irish Volunteers. During the Easter Rising, Heuston led the garrison of rebels who occupied the Mendicity Institution on Usher's Island. Under heavy fire and vastly outnumbered, Heuston surrendered in Wednesday, 26 April (the third day of the Rising). He was court-martialled, convicted and sentenced to death. He was executed on 8 May.\u000a\u000aHe writes to thank Walsh and his other colleagues at the railway and notes that before the note reaches Walsh, he will have said farewell to this 'Vale of Tears' as he departs for what he hopes is a better place.  He also writes that he has no regrets and says that it is 'better to be a corpse than a coward'.\u000a\u000aFinally, he asks that any money owed to him be paid to h

VSinéad de Valera (1878-1975) was the wife of Éamon de Valera (1882-1975).  Éamon de Valera became an Irish Volunteer in 1913 and went on to command forces at Bolands Mill during the Easter Rising. On surrender he was court-martialled and sentenced to death. However this was commuted to penal servitude for life.\u000a\u000aIn this letter Sister Cyprian sympathises with Mrs. de Valera on her husband's imprisonment. She is praying daily for his release and return to his family.\u000a\u000aShe encloses a letter )which survives) and a pair of scapulars which she asks Mrs. de Valera to give to her husband. \u000a\u000aFinally she asks Mrs.de Valera to bring her children to visit her at the Convent (Mercy, Cork St., Dublin) - a visit which, apparently, had been promised by her husband before his incarceration.

God will never refuse our prayers for this &#x2014; I trust him fully. <lb/> Since <date>1st May</date> I pray every day at Mass + Holy Communion at <lb/> 6.30 each evening I say the 30 days prayer to our B. Lady and I hope <lb/> to begin the '9 First Fridays' on <date>2nd June</date>. I promise you to continue <lb/> praying + to get all the prayers I can till I hear of Mr. De Valera's <lb/> return home. Of cource you must feel the seperation keenly but <lb/> when a man's only crime is his love for Ireland &#x2014; it's a <hi rend="underline">glorious crime</hi></p>\u000a<p>In awaiting the sentence I consoled myself with the conviction<lb/>that a man with <hi rend="underline">his handwriting</hi> would never be executed. We<lb/> have got this much + it is already a big grace &#x2014; so let us hope <lb/>for all our desires in this matter &#x2014; viz &#x2014; that your husband may <lb/>be home <hi rend="underline">very very</hi>soon</p>\u000a<p>I do not know what the rules about letters are in this <lb/>present circumstances but I enclose a letter + a pair of <unclear>scapclaus</unclear><lb/> for Mr. De Valera &#x2014; as I have used not seditious language I can't <lb/> see that he should be refused to have them. However if you<lb/> think there would be no chance of recovery then you can <lb/> burn the letter + please tell him I has at least made this <lb/> attempt. Mr. De Valera had promised to bring Vivian to see me in <lb/> Easter week. I should love to see the children &#x2014; any Saturday after next<lb/> Sunday would be convenient &#x2014; perhaps you may be able to bring them some<lb/> time. Please give B.

VÉamon deValera, (1882-1975) became an Irish Volunteer in 1913 and went on to command forces at Boland's Mill during the Rising. On surrender he was court-martialled and sentenced to death. However, this was commuted to penal servitude for life.\u000a\u000aThis letter was written after his dearth sentence had been relayed to him but before it was commuted. He is writing to an unidentified family friend advising him that he believes he will be executed - something he would find easier, were it not for his 'poor wife and helpless little ones'. He asks Jack to help his wife with decisions relating to the children in later life.

VThis letter is from Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947, to John Redmond (1856-1918), leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party from 1900 to 1918.\u000a\u000aDesmond FitzGerald had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Mountjoy, Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aIn this, and in other letters, Mrs. FitzGerald is seeking help in relation to her husband's incarceration and insists that her husband was non-combatant. She asks that, in the event of an amnesty for people who received comparatively short sentences, the severity and injustice of her husband's sentence be taken into account, particularly as she feels he is being punished for previous transgressions, for which he has already paid.

V2 Loretto Villas, Bray\u000a27th May 1916\u000a\u000aDear Sir,\u000aI must thank you for your reply to my letter of 23rd inst., re my husband's case. My husband, Mr Desmond Fitzgerald, was a non-combatant and was sentenced to 20 years penal servitude, ten of which were remitted.\u000aI quite realise that it is not a case of getting release but amnesty ; i do not desire that Mr Fitzgerald's case should be pressed with a view to release but I hope that a remittance of the sentence mat be obtained so that if the Amnesty be a graded one only freeing those persons whose sentences are comparatively short, he may be able to profit by it as he would have been able to had his sentence been in accordance with the evidence.\u000aHis case is a peculiar one, and I do not think I am asking for special favour to be shown him when I suggest that a portion of his sentence ought to be remitted till it is one based on the evidence against him and not on extraneous matters used to prejudice his case, matters for which he has already paid the penalty in deportation and imprisonment.\u000aCases of such obvious injustice would, I think, do a great deal if exposed, to strengthen the demand for Amnesty.\u000aI am glad to know that I can rely on your doing everything in your power for my husband when you feel the proper time has come to obtain a reconsideration of sentences.\u000aI am\u000aYours faithfully\u000aMabel W Fitzgerald\u000a\u000aJohn Redmond, Esq, M.P.\u000aHouse of Commons,\u000aLondon.

You probably guess what I thought of Pearse & the leaders, but the way Fitz & the O'Rahilly went in after trying to stop the affair was the sort of heroic thing to which we all have to take off our hats. I'll certainly get the facts of Fitz's behaviour & of his non-combatancy put before any people of influence I can get at. He <del>deleted text</del>ought to be treated as a political prisoner at once, & an amnesty is certain, I should say, within a very short time of a Home Rule Parliament's coming into existence. I feel exactly as you do about the executions. The English, I think, were mad to permit them from their own point-of-view. They seem to me to have given the movement a <gap/>dignity it would not have had if Asquith or Maxwell or Redmond or anybody had been as wise as Botha. Poor John MacDermott, I knew him best & liked him best of them all, but I feel Connolly is the bitterest loss. He & Skeffington.

VHugh Law (1872-1943), was an Irish nationalist MP representing County Donegal in the British House of Commons from 1902 to 1918, and subsequently served as a TD in Dáil Éireann. The letter was written by a Miss Griffin, perhaps a family friend, on behalf of Desmond Fitzgerald (1888-1947).\u000a\u000aHe had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Mountjoy, Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aMr. Law agrees that Fitzgerald's sentence is very severe but that there is very little chance of getting sentences revised yet. He does think that later it should be possible to do something - at least for those who hadn't taken an active part. He will discuss it with his colleagues in London next month.\u000a\u000aHe says that all of his children are well, including his son who has spent nearly a year on the French front.

V<address>61 Fleet Street</address>\u000a<date>May 31st</date>\u000a<salute>My dear Mrs. Fitzgerald,</salute>\u000a<p>I was very glad indeed to have your fine letter, and<lb/>the spirit running through is calculated to cure even the most cynical<lb/>of their lack of faith in the readiness of individuals to make sacrifice<lb/>for ideals.  I can understand what it must mean to you to make the sac-<lb/>rifice demanded of you, but I know that you have much too fine a conception<lb/>of your duty to Ireland to place personal feelings or considerations first.<lb/>I am sure you will find comfort in the thought that your husband has not<lb/>failed in his duty to Ireland where so many have failed.  The choice he<lb/>has made will naturally be a severe ordeal to him, it will be increased<lb/>by anxiety about you and the children, but it will make things ever so<lb/>much easier for him to know that you are facing your part with such a <lb/>fine courage.  Years ago I came to the conclusion that nothing would be<lb/>more disastrous to the Irish Nation than to attain a sham independence<lb/>without one more attempt on the part of the bravest and best of her sons<lb/>and daughters to win it by force and sacrifice rather than to rely on<lb/>sordid policital intrigues.  My one dream was that I might live to take<lb/>part in such an uprising.  In a moment of ill-health when opponents in<lb/>public and private <del> were pressing me hard and I was smarting under<lb/>a sense of ingratitude from people I had sacrificied myself in serving I<lb/> lost faith in the future and left Ireland for good.  I have never ceased<lb/>to regret that step, and my regret has been intensified manifold lately<lb/>by what has taken place.  Something of my old enthusiasm was revived by<lb/>my chance meeting with you, because almost from the first I recognised<lb/>you a woman inspired by the same faith that had kept me alive through<lb/>a boyhood and <del>deleted text</del>early manhood <del>deleted text</del> in which the profession<lb/>of views like mine meant the deprivation of ties of friendship, and even<lb/>the loss of the ordinary amenities of family life.  Regrets, however, are<lb/>useless now.</p>\u000a<p>Feeling here has not improved so far as those taking part in the<lb/>rising are concerned.  Everywhere one hears them denounced in that self-<lb/>complacent way for which the Englishman is famed. Even the more Liberal<lb/>fall back on the "argument", "But what do they expect to gain by it?"  There you have the sould<del>deleted text</del>of the Englishman laid bare.  It is always a question<lb/> of profit and loss.  He can never undertake an enterprise unless you can<lb/> work out for him with paper and pencil how much he is likely to gain by<lb/>it.  Show him in shillings, in pence, or even in decimals fo pence what<lb/>his profit is likely to be and he will risk even the puny soul he has<lb/>got.  That attitude of mind is influencing public opinion towards the<lb/>"rebels", and makes it very difficult to forecast the future.  My impres-<lb/>sion, however, is that if any "settlement" of the Irish Question is reached<lb/>the politicians will be shamed into making a general amnesty a part of it.<lb/>In that case your husband should be restored to you.  I will bear in mind<lb/>what you have told me of his case, and will do what I can at any moment<lb/>where circumstances seem to justify action.  I would not lay too much stress<lb/>on the point about the concession of belligerent rights after twenty-four<lb/>hours.  International Law is very uncertain on the point, and in the last<lb/>resort the status of men in insurrection is governed by its success </p>

Vor failure.\u000a<p>If you will tell me where your husband is confined I may be able<lb/>to pay him a visit.  I should like very much to see you again, and the <lb/>children also.  I am glad they are being brought up on the right lines,<lb/>and am sure that their father's example, not to speak of your own, will<lb/>be an inspiration to them in after life.  How are your own people taking<lb/>it?  I suppose they have disowned you.  That, however, will hardly trouble<lb/>you.  It is one of the prices one has got to pay in Ireland for daring to<lb/>develop views out of harmony with those of one's family.</p>\u000a<p>The Sheehy-Skeffington affair is terrible, but you cannot make<lb/>Englishmen realise that.  They go on as usual paying themselves compliments<lb/>about their magnanimity, their superiority to the Germans, and the ingrati-<lb/>tude of all who refuse to be content under the benevolent rule of the<lb/>Briton.  The war has been a source of some trial and difficulty to me.<lb/>All wars I detest, <del>deleted text</del>I have no enthusiasm for the "Empire," and<lb/>whether Britain goes under or not does not concern me.  I have, however,<lb/>a very strong affection for France, and some dislike of Germany.  I would<lb/>look upon it as a great disaster if France were crushed again, and for the <lb/>sake of France I do desire the success of the allies.  That does not lead<lb/>me to share the absurd <del>deleted text</del>idea about the supposed infamy of those<lb/>who have "aided" the Germans by <sic>riising</sic>the standard of revolt in Ireland.<lb/>English Statesmanship and that alone must shoulder the responsibilty for<lb/>any advantage which the enemies of France have gained from affairs in<lb/>Ireland</p>\u000a<p>I will have to finish now, but I wish you would write to me from<lb/>time to time and let me know how things are with you.  I will do what i<lb/>can to reply to you.  You must also let me know of any way in which I can<lb/>be of assistance to you.\u000a<salute>Very sincerely yours,</salute>Harry Stockman</p>

VThis letter is from R.C.

He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Mountjoy, Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aThe subject of this letter is Desmond FitzGerald's overcoat. FitzGerald had a number of transfers between prisons in Ireland before he arrived in Dartmoor Prison. The confusion about the coat arose when the officer in Richmond Barracks found a coat with a label showing the name FitzGerald and forwarded it to Mrs. Fitzgerald. It transpires that this coat belonged to another prisoner and that Mr FitzGerald was already in possession of his overcoat in Dartmoor.

VFrancis Smith lived at 6 Albert Place  with his parents and siblings at the time of the Easter Rising in 1916.  Albert Place is not far from Mount Street Bridge, where a significant battle took place during Easter week.  \u000a\u000aIn this collection, there is a letter from Fr. John S. MacMahon providing a character reference for Francis Smith. We know that this letter was successful in securing a pass as there is a telegraph dated 8 May 1916. The telegraph, which is written on Dublin Metropolitan Police Telegraph paper, is from College Street Station and requests that Francis Smyth of 6 Albert Place be allowed access to his business Place 34 Upper Baggot Street.

VThis letter from Sister Cyprian to Éamon de Valera (1882-1975) was enclosed in a letter dated 29 May 1916 addressed to Sinéad de Valera (1878-1975), his wife,  together with a pair of scapulars and a request that they be forwarded to Mr de Valera in prison.\u000a\u000a Éamon de Valera became an Irish Volunteer in 1913 and went on to command forces at Bolands Mill during the Rising. On surrender he was court-martialled and sentenced to death. However this was commuted to penal servitude for life.\u000a\u000aSr.Cyprian sympathises with his situation and reassures him of her prayers - she invites him to join her in prayer daily at 7.00 a.m.,  and she asks him to urge his wife to bring his children to her for a visit.

VMercy Convent\u000aCork Street Dublin\u000a30 - V 1916.\u000a\u000aMy dear Mr. De Valera,\u000a<p>It is no small draught of consolation that you possess the gift of <lb/>life - a gift which has become more precious than ever to those who sympathize with<lb/>you in your loneliness &amp; who love you.</p>\u000a<p>Most men of great genius have to go through in life<lb/>a period of retirement &amp; solitude, brought about by choice or by Divine Providence through<lb/>the medium of human beings.  The <hi rend="underline">Poet</hi> &amp; the <hi rend="underline">Saint</hi> have to pass this way.  Saintship<sic>unusually-spelled text</sic> is<lb/> only a special type of genius.  Now your time is come &amp; you will come out of it as<lb/> the sunshine from underneath the cloud.  A cheerful acceptation<sic>unusually-spelled text</sic> of the surroundings &amp;<lb/>the observance of rule, will go far to the shortening of your stay there.  The beginning will be<lb/>the hardest : as those in charge get to know you they will appreciate you.</p>\u000a<p>Since 1st May I have prayed every day very specially<lb/>for you that you may get grace to bear this cross &amp; be released soon.  I shall begin<lb/>this '9 First Fridays' for you on 2nd June.  If our religion be true &#x2014; and we <hi rend="underline">know</hi><hi rend="underline">it</hi> <hi rend="underline">is</hi> <hi rend="underline">true</hi> <hi rend="underline">God</hi> is <hi rend="underline">with us</hi> &amp; since He is with us, we can be in spirit with one another: now I want<lb/>you to keep a little appointment with me each day at 7 o'clock a.m. when we have Mass<lb/>&amp;Holy Communion &amp;at 6.30 p.m. when I shall say each day The 30 days prayer<lb/> to our Blessed Lady for you.  I am only asking you to try &amp;remember that you<lb/>are remembered then.  Prayer can obtain all things &#x2014; hope &amp; when God acts He doeth the work as God.  <p>\u000a<p>"This gloom after all<lb/>is but the shade of Gods hand outstretched caressingly"<pb/></p>

VThis letter is from G.H. Mercer, private secretary in the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) Office, Dublin Castle to the secretary in the Department of Recruiting for Ireland. The department oversaw the recruitment of Irishmen to the British army to fight in the Great War, or World War I.\u000a\u000aThe letter encloses a circular regarding the establishment of a school for non-commissioned officers from the RIC in which a course of 6-8 weeks will be provided. Candidates successfully completing the course would, subject to approval, go on to the rank of sergeant.\u000a\u000aThe letter advises that the inspector general of the RIC has accepted 150 of the 194 applicants for the course.

VThis letter is from Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947), to the governor of Mountjoy prison.\u000a\u000aDesmond FitzGerald had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Mountjoy, Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aMabel had written a letter to her husband in Mountjoy but he was transferred to Dartmoor before it arrived. She is concerned that the letter, when forwarded from Mountjoy to Dartmoor, will be counted as her husband's allowance of one letter on arrival in Dartmoor. She asks the governor to intervene as she fears that, under the rules, she will have to wait four months for further communication.

I had been told at the Prison that he would be able to write me and to receive one letter within the first week. I waited to write him till I should have had his letter which came on Friday morning: I posted my reply on Friday afternoon.\u000aI have just heard from him again from Dartmoor : it appears they are permitted to write once and receive a letter after arrival there.\u000aI think it very likely that my letter to my husband was forwarded on from Mountjoy in which case he fears that it may count as the letter he has the right to receive in Dartmoor.\u000aI shall be very much obliged if you will write the Governor of Dartmoor explaining  matters so that he may be given the letter which I am now writing him to Dartmoor. As <del>deleted text</del> he will not have another letter for four months I am anxious that he should not lose this on through a mistake.\u000aI am,\u000aYours truly

VMabel FitzGerald (1884-1957) was the wife of Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947), an Irish Volunteer who was present in the GPO during the Easter Rising. He was subsequently arrested, court-martialled and sentenced to 20 years penal servitude, later commuted to 10 years.\u000a\u000aThe writer sympathises with Mrs FitzGerald on her husband's imprisonment but, she says, it is a big thing that he is not dead - like The O'Rahilly. Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly (1875-1916) was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Both Fitzgerald and O'Rahilly had tried to prevent the Rising but joined in once it started. She says 'people here say he was Germanic but I say he was a true Irishman. Others say he and fellow Volunteer Ernest Blythe (1889-1975) were getting money from Germany'.\u000a\u000aThere is evidence that Desmond FitzGerald and Ernest Blythe advocated a German-Irish alliance in the lead-up to the Rising.

VL - 4 Richmond Bks. Dublin\u000a4th June 1916\u000aMy dear Mrs.Fitzgerald,\u000aI take courage to write you. I was ashamed not to have done so when Desmond was imprisoned last December.\u000aIt must have been a severe trial on you to have little Pierce at deaths door in the absence of his father. But thank God the lad was spared.\u000aI saw Desmond but once after coming up here and, unfortunately, was not able to have a word with him. A salute was all that passed between us, and next day I heard he had been tried (?). Perhaps some day soon I may meet him and tell him how Kathleen is going on. I pray that he may return to you strong in health.

VThis letter is from Ernest Blythe (1889-1975), to Mabel FitzGerald (née Washington McConnell) (1884-1958), wife of politician and intellectual Desmond FitzGerald (1888-1947).\u000a\u000aDesmond FitzGerald had served in the GPO during the Easter Rising, being placed in charge of the garrison's food supply. He initially escaped arrest after the Rising but was soon rounded up and imprisoned in Mountjoy, Dartmoor, Maidstone, Lewes and Portland.\u000a\u000aErnest Blythe was a member of the Irish Volunteers but was in prison at the time of the Rising.\u000a\u000aBlythe writes from Brixton Prison. He was surprised to hear that Desmond FitzGerald had been imprisoned but he believes he will not have to serve for long. He hasn't heard anything of his friends since he was arrested and for approximately a fortnight he hadn't been getting newspapers so he doesn't know what friends may have been killed or imprisoned in that time.

I conclude from this he didn't die immediately, & I trust you had the consolation of relieving his last moments by every kind attention & that he was fully conscious. Rev. Mothers had a general Communion offered by all here for the happy repose of his soul and Father Con offered Mass on Friday foe same intention.

VThis letter is from H.D. Chamier to Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton). Lady Clonbrock was a member of the Irish Women's Association, which was set up to provide aid and assistance to Irish regiments and to Irish members of the British army who were being held in prisoner of war camps.\u000a\u000aChamier writes about the case of two wounded soldiers, one who had an operation to save an eye and another who was assisted with ten shillings. She asks that the association's funds cover the costs and that a procedure be set up for similar cases.

VThis is a postcard sent from Tom Dolan in Dublin to his sister in Derby, England. Tom seems to be a British soldier serving in Dublin, perhaps with the Sherwood Foresters who were the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire regiment. The Foresters suffered heavy casualties during the Easter Rising in a battle with a small number of rebels around Mount Street Bridge, in the south of the city.\u000a\u000aThe postcard was written on 11 May, the day before the final executions of the leaders of the Rising. Tom writes to ensure his sister that he is safe and to show her the damage done in Dublin. The postcard is an image of the badly damage Liberty Hall, headquaters of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. Many of those who took part in the Rising set out from Liberty Hall on its opening day. It was shelled by a British gunboat during the fighting but was empty at the time.

The GPO was rebel headquarters and was shelled by British forces before it was evacuated. Tom regrets that he is unable to get an image of Sackville Street to send.

VJohn Dillon (1851-1927) was an Irish Party MP in the House of Commons. In a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 he strongly condemned the British handling of the Rising which had been put down 'with so much blood and so much savagery', and called for an immediate end to executions. Mr. Dillon assisted Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in her plea for a public inquiry and in various correspondence relating to her husband's murder and raids on her home.\u000a\u000aFrancis Sheehy Skeffington (1878-1916), a pacifist, feminist, and suffragist, was a freelance journalist and an author. During the Easter Rising he was on the streets trying to muster a civilian force to prevent looting. On 25 April 1916, Skeffington, and two others, pro-British journalists, Thomas Dixon and Patrick McIntyre, were arrested by Captain J.C. Bowen-Colthurst (1880-1966), an Anglo-Irish officer of the Royal Irish Regiment. On 26 April all three were summarily executed by firing squad at Portobello Barracks. This was one of the most notorious atrocities of Eas

VMajor Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher-Vane, (1861-1934). During the 1916 Rising he was in command of Portobello Barracks. When he learned about activities of Captain J.C.Bowen-Colthurst he reported the matter to his superiors but, sensing a cover-up, he went to London and reported to Lord Kitchener and Maurice Bonham Carter, Private Secretary to the Prime Minister. Although Bowen-Colthurst was court-martialed and found guilty, the outcome for Vane was that he was 'retired' from the military.  \u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aJohn Dillon, (1851-1927) was an Irish Party M.P. in the House of Commons. In a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 he strongly condemned the British handling of the Rising which had been put down \u201cwith so much blood and so much savagery\u201d, and called for an immediate end to executions. Mr. Dillon assisted Mrs.Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in her plea for a public inquiry and in various correspondence relating to the incident and raids on her home.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aCaptain J.C.Bowen-Colthurst, (1880-1966), an Anglo-Irish officer of the R

During the Easter Rising he was on the streets trying to muster a civilian force to prevent looting. On 25 April 1916, Skeffington, and two others, pro-British journalists, Thomas Dixon and Patrick McIntyre, were arrested by Captain J.C.

On 26 April all three were summarily executed by firing squad at Portobello Barracks.\u000a\u000aHanna Sheehy Skeffington (1877-1946), suffragette, nationalist, language teacher, was the widow of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington (who was summarily executed on 26 April 1916).

In the alternative I would ask that I should be afforded an opportunity of examining these documents a sufficient time before the Inquiry to enable me to master their contents and make copies of such as I may consider necessary and in addition that they should be produced at the Inquiry.\u000aI would also ask you to let me know at your earliest convenience the time when, the place where and the grounds upon which Mr. Sheehy Skeffington was arrested; I should also be furnished with the names and rank of the parties who effected the arrest, also of the persons who were present at the trial (if any), at the execution and at the subsequent search of Mr. Sheehy Skeffington's residence and in addition the name and rank of the several persons interviewed by Mrs. Kettle and Mrs. Culhane when they called at Portobello Barracks.\u000aI must also seek to be furnished with a copy of every report by whomsoever made which was reduced to writing dealing either with the arrest trial or execution of Mr. Sheehy Skeffington or verifying the cause of death or explaining the reasons why the search was made at Mr. Sheehy Skeffington's residence after his arrest, why Mrs. Kettle and Mrs. Culhane were placed under temporary arrest, why my client has not yet received any official notification of the death of her husband and why her request that his remains should be handed over to her for burial was altogether ignored.

VMajor Sir Francis Patrick Fletcher-Vane (1861-1934) was in command of Portobello Barracks during the Easter Rising. When he learned about activities of Captain J.C. Bowen-Colthurst he reported the matter to his superiors but, sensing a cover-up, went to London and reported to Lord Kitchener and Maurice Bonham Carter, private secretary to the prime minister. Although Bowen-Colthurst was court-martialed and found guilty, the outcome for Vane was that he was 'retired' from the military.  \u000a\u000aJohn Dillon (1851-1927) was an Irish Party M.P. in the House of Commons. In a speech in the House on 11 May 1916 he strongly condemned the British handling of the Rising which had been put down \u201cwith so much blood and so much savagery\u201d, and called for an immediate end to executions. Mr. Dillon assisted Mrs.Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington in her plea for a public inquiry and in various correspondence relating to the incident and raids on her home.\u000a\u000aFrancis Sheehy Skeffington (1878-1916) was a pacifist, feminist, suffragist, freela

This personal report of mine was carried through correctly.  On the 1st May, six days after the illegal shootings, having remonstrated with the then Commanding Officer for placing Captain Bowen Colthurst in command of the Defences, he at the time being under accusation of murder, I proceeded in due sequence to report to the Irish Command, Park Gate.  There receiving no assurance that the latter officer was to be placed under restraint, I proceeded to London and reported the facts to the Rt. Hon<hi rend="superscript">ble</hi> H. J. Tennant, late Parliamentary Secretary, W. O., (2nd May) and to the late Earl Kitchener, (3rd May).  Mr Tennant in writing thanked me for this action, and Lord </p>\u000a(1)\u000a<pb/>

In addition there are the above reports proving my efficiency in the field.</p>\u000a<p>It is well known throughout Ireland that I did not spare myself in attempting to allay the feeling of anger which had arisen when the facts of the murders became known, by rendering every assistance in my power to the widow of the murdered man, and by making it known widely that the crimes were unauthorised.</p>\u000a<p>In these circumstances I must, therefore, ask you to convey to the Army Council my desire for an explanation of the reasons which led them to relegate me to unemployment on the 30th June, seeing that then I had only recently performed duties which earned me the recommendation of a Brigadier, of strong commendation of the Officer Commanding at Portobello Barracks and the thanks of Lord Kitchener, of Mr. Tenant, and of the Private Secretary to the Prime Minister.</p>\u000a<salute>I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Captain, late Major R.M.F.</salute>

VAlice Schmutz was the landlady of Hanna Sheehy Skeffington, a suffragette, nationalist, language teacher, was the widow of Francis Sheehy-Skeffington. She was active during the Rising, bringing food to the Volunteers in the G.P.O. and the College of Surgeons. Francis Sheehy Skeffington (1878-1916) was on the streets trying to muster a civilian force to prevent looting during the Rising. On 25 April 1916, Skeffington, and two others, pro-British journalists, Thomas Dixon and Patrick McIntyre, were arrested by Captain J.C. Bowen-Colthurst (1880-1966), an Anglo-Irish officer of the Royal Irish Regiment. On 26 April all three were summarily executed by firing squad at Portobello Barracks. \u000a\u000aThe letter was written by Alice Schmutz and enclosed with Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington\u2019s letter of the same date to John Dillon MP.\u000a\u000aMrs. Schmutz gives her version of the visits to her house by detectives between 9 and 19 October 1916 and says that she cannot understand why Sgt.

VThis letter congratulates Maurice Moore on his piece in the Freeman's Journal, 'Reflections on English and Irish relations'. \u000a\u000aColonel Maurice George Moore (10 August 1854 \u2013 8 September 1939) was an Irish author, soldier and politician. Born in County Mayo, he was the younger brother of the writer George Moore. He reached the rank of colonel in 1902 but resigned his commission in 1906 over matters of principle during the Boer War. \u000a\u000aA member of the provisional committee of the Irish Volunteers in 1913, he was made the organisation's Inspector General, spending much of 1914 organising the troops in Ireland. In 1916 he collected a petition with Agnes O'Farrelly asking for a reprieve of the death sentence against Roger Casement (1864-1916), who was hanged in August 1916.

She was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly (1875-1916). The O'Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband's death \u2013 the child was born three months later.\u000a\u000aThe writer expresses sorrow for Mrs. O'Rahilly's loss. The writer's own husband was recently released and was in a terrible state, having been wounded in action at the South Dublin Union - she describes the bad treatment of her husband by 'G-Men', detective in G Unit of the Dublin Metropolitan Police.\u000a\u000aMrs. Evans' husband is hoping to get his old job back but in the meantime they are in need of charitable assistance - she asks Mrs. O'Rahilly to put them in touch with a charitable committee.

VThis is a letter of condolence to Nancy O'Rahilly (1875-1961). She was a member of the Provisional Council of Cumann na mBan at the founding in 1914 and the wife of Michael Joseph O'Rahilly, self-described as 'The' O'Rahilly (1875-1916). The O'Rahilly fought in the Easter Rising and was shot in Parnell/Moore Street on 28 April 1916 and died some time later. Nancy was pregnant at the time of her husband's death \u2013 the child was born three months later.\u000a\u000aThe writer expresses deepest sympathy and says that The O'Rahilly's name is a household word in his area. He assures her that 'that spot in Moore St.' (where her husband died) will be a place of pilgrimage for generations to come.

VThis is a letter from Geraldine Sarah Bourke (née Ponsonby), Lady Mayo (1863-1944) to Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Lady Clonbrock, wife of Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock (1834-1917) was a member of the Irish Women's Association. Formed in London in the Spring of 1915, the IWA's purpose was to provide food and comforts for prisoners of war belonging to Irish Regiments. Lady Mayo(1863-1944), was a committee member in The Royal Dublin Fusiliers' County Kildare Committee. The Committee dealt with parcels for RDF prisoners of war abroad.\u000a\u000aLady Mayo refers to a parcel sent to Pte. Joseph Connolly - there appears to be a situation where some prisoners are getting too many parcels and the German authorities are suppressing them. She also refers to £14 sent to Berne to cover 24 weeks' supply of bread for Connolly - a note on the back of the letter, possibly written by Lady Clonbrock, confirms this and also that Lady Mayo is the contact.\u000a\u000aLady Mayo is having difficulty

VThis is a letter from Lieutentant W.E. Gilliland of the Depot Des Prisonniers de Guerre to Anne MacDonnell, honorary secretary of the Irish Women's Association (IWA), founded to provide assistant to Irish prisoners of war.\u000a\u000aLieut. Gilliland requests that the IWA liaise with other committees sending parcels to Prisoners of War. The problem is that some prisoners are getting so many parcels from different quarters that they are in a position to sell their surplus. He also concerned that prisoners were now requesting items such as watches and safety razors.\u000a\u000aA handwritten note at the bottom of this typed letter, addressed to Lady Clonbrock, says that this is a copy received from the IWA and that it will interest her. The note is signed by H.D. Chamier.\u000a\u000aLady Clonbrock, Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), (1839-1928), was an active member of the IWA.

VDepot Des Prisonniers de Guerre,\u000aPhilipopple,\u000aBulgaria.\u000a14th July, 1916.\u000aDear Miss MacDonnell, \u000aWe are indeed grateful for all your Association is doing for the British Prisoners of War here. But, I might ask you to get in touch with Regimental and other Committees which are sending parcels.\u000aThe fact of the matter is in far <del>tt</del>too many cases tins of provisions and chocolate, and underclothing, are being sold right and left. This practice is naturally more general among men who receive parcels from many organisations. There is one man who gets parcels from ten Societies and I have known him to receive as many as eight parcels at a time. He is not generous. I suppose he has had seventy or eighty parcels already. He gave me one to <del>giv</del>give to some man who had up to then not received any at all.\u000aAnother point : I have reason to believe that the men, in response to your Association's request to let you know what they want, are asking for all sorts of things :- watches, safety razors &c.\u000aTo save time, I am now going to do a preliminary <del>censorshi</del>censorship of letters at the request of the Commandant. Will you please ignore all demands for luxuries unless I have countersigned the letter or card asking for them. It is a bit distressing to put it mildly, when you find men selling 4oz jars or bottles of meat extracts for twopence, large cakes of chocolate for tenpence and hand knitted woollen socks for ninepence. There is a ready market for most things, and I am sure watches and safety razors would be quickly disposed of.\u000a(Sgd) W.E. Gilliland, Lieut.\u000a<note>Handwritten footnote</note>: Dear Lady Clonbrock,\u000aAbove copy of letter sent me from I.W.A. will interest you.\u000aYours\u000aHO Channier

VThis is a letters from George Ulick Browne (1856-1935), 6th Marquess of Sligo to Lady Clonbrock, Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), (1839-1928), wife of Luke Gerald Dillon, 4th Baron Clonbrock (1834-1917). Lady Clonbrock was one of a number of ladies who were members of the Irish Women's Association. Formed in London in the Spring of 1915, the IWA.'s purpose was to provide food and comforts for prisoners of war belonging to Irish Regiments.\u000a\u000aThe writer refers to two letters from Connaught Rangers Prisoners of War in Bulgaria to Lady Mayo, Geraldine Sarah Ponsonby, Countess of Mayo, (1863-1944). These POWs claimed that they hadn't received any parcels. Sligo advises that this is incorrect and goes on to say that the men from the Connaught Rangers are apparently playing everybody, begging here and there and pretending that they are being neglected.\u000a\u000aThe writer says that this will continue unless the people sending the parcels consult first with Regimental and Central Organisations.\u000a\u000aHe encloses a circular

Foland, both 5th Connaught Rangers, Prisoners of War at Phillippoplis, Bulgaria, stating that they had not received any parcels, either Clothing or food. I find that both these men have been receiving their parcels regularly, and have as regularly acknowledged them. They have received complete outfits of Clothes, shaving &c &c., and another complete outfit is going out this week.\u000aI regret to say that the men of the Connaught Rangers are in the habit of begging right and left, apparently from everybody they know, and misrepresenting that they are being neglected, but as long as people send parcels individually, in reply to any request that may be made, and not through Regimental or Central Organisations, they are indeed encouraged to do so.\u000aI enclose a Circular which I issued to all my Subscribers last June, in which I pointed out the procedure recommended with reference to Prisoners of War in Bulgaria.\u000aSincerely\u000aSligo

VThis is a letter from Kathleen Clarke (née Daly) (1878-1972), republican activist, to Fr Albert Bibby (1877-1958). Kathleen Clarke's husband, Thomas Clarke (1858-1916), and brother, Edward 'Ned' Daly, were both executed for their part in the Easter Rising and Kathleen had been an active republican before the Rising. Fr Albert, born Thomas Bibby, was a Capuchin priest in Church Street in Dublin. In the aftermath of the Easter Rising, he ministered to a number of rebel prisoners in Kilmainham Gaol, including some of the executed leaders.\u000a\u000aIn the letter, sent from the Daly family home in Limerick, Clarke thanks Fr Albert fro a previous letter and offers her prayers for him. She fills him in on her family, noting that she is bringing her son in Dublin and that her sisters Madge and Norah will be travelling too but instead going to Glendalough 'for a rest'. She also describes the effect of Ned Daly's execution on her mother.

VThis is a letter from Mrs. Arthur Goff, honorary secretary of the Dundrum Prisoners of War Organisation, to Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Mrs. Goff had a similar role to Lady Clonbrock in the Irish Women's Association, formed in London in the Spring of 1915 for the purpose of providing food and comforts for prisoners of war belonging to Irish Regiments. \u000a\u000aThe letter indicates an element of confusion and overlap which Mrs. Goff has been trying to avoid. She has been sending parcels to a number of named individuals and she has 'adopters' to pay for them although there is an inference that the men may be getting parcels from other organisations.\u000a\u000aShe has been having similar problems with the Dublin Fusiliers and the English Regiments but, she feels, these are happy to have their men looked after without having to deplete their funds.\u000a\u000aShe suggests that bread, which she regards as essential, is not similarly regarded by the prisoners.\u000a\u000aEnclosed with this letter is an informat

VThis letter was presumably addressed to Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928), a prominent member of the Irish Women's Association, founded to provide assistance and supplies to Irish prisoners of war.\u000a\u000aThe writer is concerned that a particular P.O.W., who has been transferred to another camp, may no longer be getting parcels. Writer encloses the last two (post)cards she got from him.\u000a\u000aA note added to the letter (by Lady Clonbrock) reads "Returned 2 cards - I.W.A. say a Lady in England sends parcels regularly to him through them and Extras".

VThis is a letter from Mrs Armstrong to Augusta Caroline Dillon (née Crofton), Lady Clonbrock (1839-1928). Lady Clonbrock was a prominent member of the Irish Women's Association, founded in 1915 to provide aid and comfort to Irish prisoners of war.\u000a\u000aThis letter concerns wounded WW1 soldiers. While they are initially on a high rate of pension, the writer advises that cut are imminent and she is hoping that a local relief fund will give supplementary assistance.\u000a\u000aShe discusses a number of individuals, describing their injuries (mostly amputees), their current pensions and the likely reductions, their suitability/willingness to work. Some apparently have problems with alcohol and some have overcome these problems. Some may be suitable for farm work and the writer suggests that others might be trained in basket making and re-caning chairs in order to supplement their income but  "it will be difficult to get them to do anything". She has been told that if these men are brought together in Dublin for training they

Ms. Lewis sought clarification from the IWA and she encloses the reply (not available). She wants to know if the term 'godmothers' applies to her mother and her mother's friend, or whether they have been sending unnecessary parcels.\u000a\u000aNote: Fortnightly parcels were sent to some 1600 P.O.W.s whose names had been supplied by the Regiments.

Lady Clonbrock was a prominent member of the Irish Women's Association, founded to provide aid and assistance to Irish prisoners of war.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThe writer is looking for information about two men so that his committee may be able to help them.\u000a\u000aHis committee is in the process of setting up a hostel (for ex-soldiers). He says that they can only help those who want to help themselves and that there  will be no room for 'inebriates or other bad cases'. They will be running classes for the men and he expects that there is a lot of interest.\u000a\u000aHe awaits Lady Clonbrock's recommendations which will be 'carefully considered by the Committee'.  \u000a\u000aA note added to the letter (by Lady Clonbrock) indicates her intention to bring the matter before her committee meeting on the following week.

VThis is a pass issued by a constable in the District Inspector's Office of the Royal Irish Constabulary in Galway. The pass was sent with Fr Thomas Burke to allow him to travel from Galway to Dublin by train and then on to England. The pass also gives a physical description of Fr Burke.

Martial Law, the terms of which included travel restrictions, was imposed during the Rising and was still in operation when this pass was issued.\u000a\u000aFr Burke was from Castlegar, County Galway, was from a family that was involved in the Irish struggle for independence and later served as chaplain to the Galway Brigade of the Irish Republican Army.

VThis is a letter from M.L. Walker of the Home Office in Whitehall, London, to the commandant of Frongach internment camp in Wales. After the Easter Rising over 3,400 men and women were arrested and interned in prisons and camps in Ireland, England and Wales. The majority were released after a short imprisonment and eventually most of the men who remained imprisoned were transferred to Frongach in north Wales. By October 1916 there were still over 500 men interned there.\u000a\u000aThis letter refers to the case of a number of prisoners who were punished for refusing to perform 'fatigue duty'. Walker asks that the remainder of the punishment be remitted and that the men are no longer asked to perform those duties.\u000a\u000aThis letter is contained in the collection of papers relating to the Cowan family of Drumcondra and their uncle, Seamus McGowan who was a captain in the Irish Citizen Army and was one of the men imprisoned in Frongach after the Rising.

During the Rising he commanded the garrison in the South Dublin Union. Following the surrender he was tried by court-martial and sentenced to death. He was executed on 8 May 1916.\u000a\u000aA handwritten note by Eithne Coyle O'Donnell notes that the copy was given to her by Ceann't wife, Áine (1880-1954), shortly before her death.

VCell 88\u000aKilmainham Gaol,\u000aMay 1916\u000a\u000aI leave for the guidance of the other revolutionaries who may tread the path which I have trod this advice: never to treat with the enemy, never to surrender to his mercy but to fight to a finish. I see nothing gained but grave disaster caused by the surrender which has marked the end of the Irish Insurrection of 1916 - so far at least as Dublin is concerned. The enemy has not cherished one generous thought for those who, with little hope, with poor equipment and weak in members withstood his forces for one glorious week. Ireland has shown that she is a nation. This generation can claim to have raised sons as brave as any that went before and in the years to come  Ireland will honour those who risked all for her honour at Easter 1916. I bear no ill-will towards those against whom I fought. I have found the common soldiers and the higher officers humane and companionable, even the English who were actually in the fight against us. Thank God soldiering for Ireland has opened my heart and helped me to see pure humanity where I expect to find only scorn and reproach. I have met the man who escaped from me by a ruse under the Red Cross but I do not regret having withheld my fire. He gave me cakes. I wish to record the magnificent gallantry and fearless calm determination of the men who fought with me. All were simply splendid. Even I knew no fear or panic and shrunk from no risk even as I shrink not now from the death that faces me at day-break. I hope to see the face of God even for a moment in the morning. His will be done. All here are very kind.\u000a\u000aMy poor wife saw me yesterday and bore up; so the warder told me, even when she left my presence. Poor Aine, poor Ronan, God is their only shield now that I am removed and God is a better shield that I. I have seen Aine Nell Richard and Mick and bit them conditional goodbye. \u000aEven now they have hope.\u000a\u000aEamonn Ceannt.

VCell 88\u000aKilmainham Gaol,\u000aMay 1916\u000a\u000aI leave for the guidance of the other revolutionaries who may tread the path which I have trod this advice: never to treat with the enemy, never to surrender to his mercy but to fight to a finish. I see nothing gained but grave disaster caused by the surrender which has marked the end of the Irish Insurrection of 1916 - so far at least as Dublin is concerned. The enemy has not cherished one generous thought for those who, with little hope, with poor equipment and weak in members withstood his forces for one glorious week. Ireland has shown that she is a nation. This generation can claim to have raised sons as brave as any that went before and in the years to come  Ireland will honour those who risked all for her honour at Easter 1916. I bear no ill-will towards those against whom I fought. I have found the common soldiers and the higher officers humane and companionable, even the English who were actually in the fight against us. Thank God soldiering for Ireland has opened my heart and helped me to see pure humanity where I expect to find only scorn and reproach. I have met the man who escaped from me by a ruse under the red cross but I do not regret having withheld my fire. He gave me cakes. I wish to record the magnificent gallantry and fearless calm determination of the men who fought with me. All were simply splendid. Even I knew no fear or panic and shrunk from no risk even as I shrink not now from the death that faces me at day-break. I hope to see the face of God even for a moment in the morning. His will be done. All here are very kind.\u000a\u000aMy poor wife saw me yesterday and bore up; so the warder told me, even when she left my presence. Poor Aine, poor Ronan, God is their only shield now that I am removed and God is a better shield that I. I have seen Aine Nell Richard and Mick and bit them conditional goodbye. \u000aEven now they have hope.\u000a\u000aEamonn Ceannt.\u000a\u000aHandwritten addendum, added aferwards in ballpoint pen: Received this copy of Eamonn Ceannt's last letter from his wife before her death.

VThis is a letter from Margaret Mary Pearse (1878\u20131968) to Mabel FitzGerald, (1884-1957) was the wife of Desmond Fitzgerald. Margaret Pearse was the sister of Patrick Pearse (1879-1916), one of the leaders of the Easter Rising in 1916, who was executed on 3 May 1916. Another brother, Willie Pearse, was also executed.\u000a\u000aDesmond FitzGerald, (1888-1947), was an Irish Volunteer and was present in the GPO during the Rising. He was subsequently arrested, court-martialed and sentenced to 20 years Penal Servitude, later commuted to 10 years.\u000a\u000aMiss Pearse acknowledges the kind words Mrs. Fitzgerald sent to her mother (Margaret Pearse (1857-1932)) about her brother, Patrick.\u000a\u000aThe writer goes on to describe her visits to HM Prison in Dartmoor and describes conditions for the Irish prisoners there, which she finds quite reasonable.\u000a\u000aShe thinks it is a good thing that the Irish prisoners are segregated from ordinary criminals.\u000a\u000aShe advises Mrs FitzGerald that it is possible to send books in to the prison but that the book

Caitlín Burgess was the wife of Cathal Brugha (Burgess) (née Kingston (1874-1922), second-in-command at the South Dublin Union during the Easter Rising 1916. He was badly woulded in action but survived. Desmond Fitzgerald was imprisoned for his part in the Rising.\u000a\u000aCaitlín Brugha apologises for missing Mrs. FitzGerald when she called to her house and indicates when she will be available for a further visit - she is likely to be out visiting (her husband) in hospital at certain times.\u000a\u000aShe sympathises with Mrs. FitzGerald over what has happened her husband and says her own trouble was like a bad dream and she is not surprised that her baby daughter arrived earlier than expected.\u000a\u000aShe also writes that her husband had had an operation and was in great pain, unable to sleep.

VJames Ryan (1891-1970) studied medicine in UCD. He was appointed chief medical officer in the GPO during the Easter Rising. After the Rising he was imprisoned in Stafford and, later, Frongoch and was released in August 1916. Ryan was later a founder member of Fianna Fáil and a government minister.\u000a\u000aThis letter was written while Ryan was a prisoner in Stafford. The writer refers to people at home who are asking for Ryan, two of his fellow prisoners and requests that Ryan let her know if he would like anything sent to him.

VLawrence Brown wrote this letter while on board the HMS Defence. He wrote to his sister Margaret Brown, who at the time was living at the Viceregal Lodge, the official residence of the lord lieutentant of Ireland (Lord Wimborne in 1915) in the Phoenix Park, Dublin. \u000a\u000aLawrence was a gunner in the Royal Marine Artillery. On 31 May 1916 the HMS Defence was sunk during the Battle of Jutland, the largest naval battle of the Great War, and Lawrence was killed. His body was never recovered.\u000a\u000aIn the letter, Laurence makes no reference to the war except to say that there is 'always a lot of noise' on the ship. He refers to his family, mentions that he has a cold and says that he will write to another sister.\u000a\u000aAttached is a photograph of Lawrence Brown.

He had been married the previous year (23 Aug) and his wife was expecting their first child.  He believed he was about to be executed, hence the \u2018last letter\u2019.\u000a\u000aThe Tom referred to in the letter was his cousin who died during the fighting.\u000a\u000aLily, Annie and Jennie were my grandmother\u2019s sisters while the second Annie mentioned was his own sister.\u000a\u000a\u201cChurch Street people\u201d refers to the Capuchin Friary in Church Street, where he was a member of the \u2018Third Order\u2019.\u000a\u000aBrennan was tried at Richmond Barracks and sentenced to death.  The sentence was commuted to penal servitude and he was released in June 1917.  His first born son was then 1 year old, having been born on 17 June 1916.

Byrne was first elected an MP in the 1915 by-election as a nationalist candidate for the Irish Parliamentary Party. Although opposed to the Easter Rising, he spent 1916 lobbying on behalf of the interned prisoners. Before the Rising he was also a vociferous anti-conscription campaigner. Malony was a founder member of Inghinide na hEireann, a member of the Irish Citizen Army and a close colleague of James Connolly and Countess Markievicz. She was part of the garrison of rebels who seized City Hall during the Easter Rising and was imprisoned in Aylesbury prison until December 1916. Nellie Gifford was an active opponent of conscription in Ireland. She was a member of the Irish Citizen Army and part of the St Stephen's Green garrison during the Easter Rising.

Pearse was a leading member of the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Republican Brotherhood. He was one of the leaders of the Easter Rising, a signatory of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic, commander in chief of the rebel forces and declared president of the Provisional Government on the outbreak of the Rising.

VThis is a letter from Harry Boland to his mother Catherine 'Kate' Boland (née Woods, c. 1861-1932). Boland was a keen member of the GAA, the Irish Republican Brotherhood and the Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. During the Easter Rising he was a member of the rebel garrison in the GPO and, despite having no officer rank, was sentenced to ten years' penal servitude. He was imprisoned in Dartmoor, Lewes and Maidstone.\u000a\u000aThis letter was written while Boland was a prisoner in Dartmoor. He describes the journey to Dartmoor, his high spirits, refers to friends and family and also mentions that he has read about a settlement of the 'Irish Question' between John Redmond, leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party, and Edward Carson, the Ulster Unionist leader. Boland's brothers, Gerald and Edmund, were also involved in the Rising and Gerald, referred to in the letters, was also imprisoned in England.

Vwhen Father Died when you were left with 5 of us babies to rear &amp; you reared us all &amp; gave us everything that was necessary to us &amp; as Fathers friends stood to you then you will find others now.

At the same time we are prepared to go our full time.  I want you to tell all my friends that I am quite happy cheerful &amp; content I can not write to them all.  If you would rather keep my Croke Cup Medal &amp; give Mrs OToole my Dublin Championship medal you may do so as she was very nice <add>to</add> me &amp; I promised her that day on the field before the match that I would give her the medal if we won you can keep the rest of them &amp; give her the other.  I wonder will I be too slow to play when I come out, the regular life here will have me in great form.  We arrived here at 7.0 &amp; were a source of wonder to the parish as I am sure it is an unusual sight to see 12 men some in uniform &amp; some not matching under guard of fixed Bayonets to prison but wee marched with heads up &amp; firm foot as Irishmen the people were quite respectful to us, I will not close this note hoping I have convinced you that I am quite happy &amp; settled &amp; will face this business in the proper spirit so now may God Bless you give you comfort &amp; keepye all until happier days when we shall all be united in some you may be quite sure that we will be well treated Your loving son\u000aHarry

VTomás MacCurtain, (1884-1920), led 1000 Irish Volunteers in Cork at the outset of the 1916 Easter Rising but, due to conflicting orders from Dublin, the Cork Volunteers didn't participate in any fighting. MacCurtain was subsequently imprisoned with other 1916 Irish Volunteers at Frongach Prisoner of War Camp in Wales.\u000a\u000aTadhg Barry, (1880-1921) was a journalist, trade unionist, and a founding member of the Irish Volunteers in Cork.\u000a\u000aArthur Griffith, (1872-1922), Irish politician, writer, founder of Sinn Féin, and signatory of the Anglo-Irish Treaty in 1921.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aThis letter may have been written from Frongoch P.O.W.

The writer has been getting news of home and of Barry's activities (Gaelic League).\u000a\u000aApparently Barry had expressed words of encouragement for a mutual acquaintance, Arthur (probably Arthur Griffith) which MacCurtain endorses.

Blythe had been arrested under the Defence of the Realm Act. He was released from prison in England before the Easter Rising but was rearrested there during Easter week 1916.\u000a\u000aGeorge White, the author of the letter, is a clerk working in George Gavan Duffy's legal practice. He acknowledges Blythe's letter of 29 May in the absence of Gavan Duffy and says he will bring it to his attention shortly.

VThis letter is from a collection Patrick English, who at the time of writing was a prisoner in Stafford prison and Frongoch internment camp.  While this letter is undated, it is clear from the context that the letter was written not long after the Rising.  In the letter, Davie tells his brother that he is not to worry about their mother, although she is very lonely.  \u000a\u000aDavie writes about the lack of sport and enquires after other people he knows that are in Frongoch with his brother.  He also mentions how sad he feels about the events of the Rising and how he hopes that peace will come soon.\u000a\u000aHe ends the letter with a postscript that Patrick will have to find another girlfriend when he gets home as his one is now going out with a soldier.
