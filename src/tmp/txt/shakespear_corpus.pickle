Scene I.\n[King Lear's Palace.]\n\nEnter Kent, Gloucester, and Edmund. [Kent and Glouceste converse.\nEdmund stands back.]\n\n  Kent. I thought the King had more affected the Duke of Albany\nthan\n     Cornwall.\n  Glou. It did always seem so to us; but now, in the division of\nthe\n     kingdom, it appears not which of the Dukes he values most,\nfor\n     equalities are so weigh'd that curiosity in neither can make\n     choice of either's moiety.\n  Kent. Is not this your son, my lord?\n  Glou. His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge. I have so\noften\n     blush'd to acknowledge him that now I am braz'd to't.\n  Kent. I cannot conceive you.\n  Glou. Sir, this young fellow's mother could; whereupon she grew\n     round-womb'd, and had indeed, sir, a son for her cradle ere\nshe\n     had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault?\n  Kent. I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so\n     proper.\n  Glou. But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year elder\nthan\n     this, who yet is no dearer in my account. Though this knave\ncame\n     something saucily into the world before he was sent for, yet\nwas \n     his mother fair, there was good sport at his making, and the\n     whoreson must be acknowledged.- Do you know this noble\ngentleman,\n     Edmund?\n  Edm. [comes forward] No, my lord.\n  Glou. My Lord of Kent. Remember him hereafter as my honourable\n     friend.\n  Edm. My services to your lordship.\n  Kent. I must love you, and sue to know you better.\n  Edm. Sir, I shall study deserving.\n  Glou. He hath been out nine years, and away he shall again.\n                                                 Sound a sennet.\n     The King is coming.\n\n      Enter one bearing a coronet; then Lear; then the Dukes of\n      Albany and Cornwall; next, Goneril, Regan, Cordelia, with\n                              Followers.\n\n  Lear. Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.\n  Glou. I shall, my liege.\n                                 Exeunt [Gloucester and Edmund].\n  Lear. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.\n     Give me the map there. Know we have divided \n     In three our kingdom; and 'tis our fast intent\n     To shake all cares and business from our age,\n     Conferring them on younger strengths while we\n     Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,\n     And you, our no less loving son of Albany,\n     We have this hour a constant will to publish\n     Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife\n     May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,\n     Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,\n     Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,\n     And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters\n     (Since now we will divest us both of rule,\n     Interest of territory, cares of state),\n     Which of you shall we say doth love us most?\n     That we our largest bounty may extend\n     Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,\n     Our eldest-born, speak first.\n  Gon. Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;\n     Dearer than eyesight, space, and liberty;\n     Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; \n     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;\n     As much as child e'er lov'd, or father found;\n     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable.\n     Beyond all manner of so much I love you.\n  Cor. [aside] What shall Cordelia speak? Love, and be silent.\n  Lear. Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,\n     With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,\n     With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,\n     We make thee lady. To thine and Albany's issue\n     Be this perpetual.- What says our second daughter,\n     Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.\n  Reg. Sir, I am made\n     Of the selfsame metal that my sister is,\n     And prize me at her worth. In my true heart\n     I find she names my very deed of love;\n     Only she comes too short, that I profess\n     Myself an enemy to all other joys\n     Which the most precious square of sense possesses,\n     And find I am alone felicitate\n     In your dear Highness' love. \n  Cor. [aside] Then poor Cordelia!\n     And yet not so; since I am sure my love's\n     More richer than my tongue.\n  Lear. To thee and thine hereditary ever\n     Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom,\n     No less in space, validity, and pleasure\n     Than that conferr'd on Goneril.- Now, our joy,\n     Although the last, not least; to whose young love\n     The vines of France and milk of Burgundy\n     Strive to be interest; what can you say to draw\n     A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.\n  Cor. Nothing, my lord.\n  Lear. Nothing?\n  Cor. Nothing.\n  Lear. Nothing can come of nothing. Speak again.\n  Cor. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave\n     My heart into my mouth. I love your Majesty\n     According to my bond; no more nor less.\n  Lear. How, how, Cordelia? Mend your speech a little,\n     Lest it may mar your fortunes. \n  Cor. Good my lord,\n     You have begot me, bred me, lov'd me; I\n     Return those duties back as are right fit,\n     Obey you, love you, and most honour you.\n     Why have my sisters husbands, if they say\n     They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,\n     That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry\n     Half my love with him, half my care and duty.\n     Sure I shall never marry like my sisters,\n     To love my father all.\n  Lear. But goes thy heart with this?\n  Cor. Ay, good my lord.\n  Lear. So young, and so untender?\n  Cor. So young, my lord, and true.\n  Lear. Let it be so! thy truth then be thy dower!\n     For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,\n     The mysteries of Hecate and the night;\n     By all the operation of the orbs\n     From whom we do exist and cease to be;\n     Here I disclaim all my paternal care, \n     Propinquity and property of blood,\n     And as a stranger to my heart and me\n     Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,\n     Or he that makes his generation messes\n     To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom\n     Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and reliev'd,\n     As thou my sometime daughter.\n  Kent. Good my liege-\n  Lear. Peace, Kent!\n     Come not between the dragon and his wrath.\n     I lov'd her most, and thought to set my rest\n     On her kind nursery.- Hence and avoid my sight!-\n     So be my grave my peace as here I give\n     Her father's heart from her! Call France! Who stirs?\n     Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany,\n     With my two daughters' dowers digest this third;\n     Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.\n     I do invest you jointly in my power,\n     Preeminence, and all the large effects\n     That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, \n     With reservation of an hundred knights,\n     By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode\n     Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain\n     The name, and all th' additions to a king. The sway,\n     Revenue, execution of the rest,\n     Beloved sons, be yours; which to confirm,\n     This coronet part betwixt you.\n  Kent. Royal Lear,\n     Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,\n     Lov'd as my father, as my master follow'd,\n     As my great patron thought on in my prayers-\n  Lear. The bow is bent and drawn; make from the shaft.\n  Kent. Let it fall rather, though the fork invade\n     The region of my heart! Be Kent unmannerly\n     When Lear is mad. What wouldst thou do, old man?\n     Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak\n     When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound\n     When majesty falls to folly. Reverse thy doom;\n     And in thy best consideration check\n     This hideous rashness. Answer my life my judgment, \n     Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least,\n     Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound\n     Reverbs no hollowness.\n  Lear. Kent, on thy life, no more!\n  Kent. My life I never held but as a pawn\n     To wage against thine enemies; nor fear to lose it,\n     Thy safety being the motive.\n  Lear. Out of my sight!\n  Kent. See better, Lear, and let me still remain\n     The true blank of thine eye.\n  Lear. Now by Apollo-\n  Kent. Now by Apollo, King,\n     Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.\n  Lear. O vassal! miscreant!\n                                   [Lays his hand on his sword.]\n  Alb., Corn. Dear sir, forbear!\n  Kent. Do!\n     Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow\n     Upon the foul disease. Revoke thy gift,\n     Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, \n     I'll tell thee thou dost evil.\n  Lear. Hear me, recreant!\n     On thine allegiance, hear me!\n     Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow-\n     Which we durst never yet- and with strain'd pride\n     To come between our sentence and our power,-\n     Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,-\n     Our potency made good, take thy reward.\n     Five days we do allot thee for provision\n     To shield thee from diseases of the world,\n     And on the sixth to turn thy hated back\n     Upon our kingdom. If, on the tenth day following,\n     Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,\n     The moment is thy death. Away! By Jupiter,\n     This shall not be revok'd.\n  Kent. Fare thee well, King. Since thus thou wilt appear,\n     Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.\n     [To Cordelia] The gods to their dear shelter take thee,\nmaid,\n     That justly think'st and hast most rightly said!\n     [To Regan and Goneril] And your large speeches may your\ndeeds \n        approve,\n     That good effects may spring from words of love.\n     Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;\n     He'll shape his old course in a country new.\nExit.\n\n  Flourish. Enter Gloucester, with France and Burgundy;\nAttendants.\n\n  Glou. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.\n  Lear. My Lord of Burgundy,\n     We first address toward you, who with this king\n     Hath rivall'd for our daughter. What in the least\n     Will you require in present dower with her,\n     Or cease your quest of love?\n  Bur. Most royal Majesty,\n     I crave no more than hath your Highness offer'd,\n     Nor will you tender less.\n  Lear. Right noble Burgundy,\n     When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;\n     But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.\n     If aught within that little seeming substance,\n     Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd, \n     And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,\n     She's there, and she is yours.\n  Bur. I know no answer.\n  Lear. Will you, with those infirmities she owes,\n     Unfriended, new adopted to our hate,\n     Dow'r'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,\n     Take her, or leave her?\n  Bur. Pardon me, royal sir.\n     Election makes not up on such conditions.\n  Lear. Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,\n     I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,\n     I would not from your love make such a stray\n     To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you\n     T' avert your liking a more worthier way\n     Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd\n     Almost t' acknowledge hers.\n  France. This is most strange,\n     That she that even but now was your best object,\n     The argument of your praise, balm of your age,\n     Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time \n     Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle\n     So many folds of favour. Sure her offence\n     Must be of such unnatural degree\n     That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection\n     Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her\n     Must be a faith that reason without miracle\n     Should never plant in me.\n  Cor. I yet beseech your Majesty,\n     If for I want that glib and oily art\n     To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,\n     I'll do't before I speak- that you make known\n     It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,\n     No unchaste action or dishonoured step,\n     That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;\n     But even for want of that for which I am richer-\n     A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue\n     As I am glad I have not, though not to have it\n     Hath lost me in your liking.\n  Lear. Better thou\n     Hadst not been born than not t' have pleas'd me better. \n  France. Is it but this- a tardiness in nature\n     Which often leaves the history unspoke\n     That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,\n     What say you to the lady? Love's not love\n     When it is mingled with regards that stands\n     Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?\n     She is herself a dowry.\n  Bur. Royal Lear,\n     Give but that portion which yourself propos'd,\n     And here I take Cordelia by the hand,\n     Duchess of Burgundy.\n  Lear. Nothing! I have sworn; I am firm.\n  Bur. I am sorry then you have so lost a father\n     That you must lose a husband.\n  Cor. Peace be with Burgundy!\n     Since that respects of fortune are his love,\n     I shall not be his wife.\n  France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;\n     Most choice, forsaken; and most lov'd, despis'd!\n     Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon. \n     Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.\n     Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect\n     My love should kindle to inflam'd respect.\n     Thy dow'rless daughter, King, thrown to my chance,\n     Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France.\n     Not all the dukes in wat'rish Burgundy\n     Can buy this unpriz'd precious maid of me.\n     Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind.\n     Thou losest here, a better where to find.\n  Lear. Thou hast her, France; let her be thine; for we\n     Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see\n     That face of hers again. Therefore be gone\n     Without our grace, our love, our benison.\n     Come, noble Burgundy.\n             Flourish. Exeunt Lear, Burgundy, [Cornwall, Albany,\n                                    Gloucester, and Attendants].\n  France. Bid farewell to your sisters.\n  Cor. The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes\n     Cordelia leaves you. I know you what you are;\n     And, like a sister, am most loath to call \n     Your faults as they are nam'd. Use well our father.\n     To your professed bosoms I commit him;\n     But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,\n     I would prefer him to a better place!\n     So farewell to you both.\n  Gon. Prescribe not us our duties.\n  Reg. Let your study\n     Be to content your lord, who hath receiv'd you\n     At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,\n     And well are worth the want that you have wanted.\n  Cor. Time shall unfold what plighted cunning hides.\n     Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.\n     Well may you prosper!\n  France. Come, my fair Cordelia.\n                                     Exeunt France and Cordelia.\n  Gon. Sister, it is not little I have to say of what most nearly\n     appertains to us both. I think our father will hence\nto-night.\n  Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.\n  Gon. You see how full of changes his age is. The observation we\n     have made of it hath not been little. He always lov'd our \n     sister most, and with what poor judgment he hath now cast\nher\n     off appears too grossly.\n  Reg. 'Tis the infirmity of his age; yet he hath ever but\nslenderly\n     known himself.\n  Gon. The best and soundest of his time hath been but rash; then\n     must we look to receive from his age, not alone the\n     imperfections of long-ingraffed condition, but therewithal\n     the unruly waywardness that infirm and choleric years bring\nwith\n     them.\n  Reg. Such unconstant starts are we like to have from him as\nthis\n     of Kent's banishment.\n  Gon. There is further compliment of leave-taking between France\nand\n     him. Pray you let's hit together. If our father carry\nauthority\n     with such dispositions as he bears, this last surrender of\nhis\n     will but offend us.\n  Reg. We shall further think on't.\n  Gon. We must do something, and i' th' heat.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene II.\nThe Earl of Gloucester's Castle.\n\nEnter [Edmund the] Bastard solus, [with a letter].\n\n  Edm. Thou, Nature, art my goddess; to thy law\n     My services are bound. Wherefore should I\n     Stand in the plague of custom, and permit\n     The curiosity of nations to deprive me,\n     For that I am some twelve or fourteen moonshines\n     Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?\n     When my dimensions are as well compact,\n     My mind as generous, and my shape as true,\n     As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us\n     With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?\n     Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take\n     More composition and fierce quality\n     Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,\n     Go to th' creating a whole tribe of fops\n     Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well then,\n     Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land.\n     Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund\n     As to th' legitimate. Fine word- 'legitimate'!\n     Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed, \n     And my invention thrive, Edmund the base\n     Shall top th' legitimate. I grow; I prosper.\n     Now, gods, stand up for bastards!\n\n                          Enter Gloucester.\n\n  Glou. Kent banish'd thus? and France in choler parted?\n     And the King gone to-night? subscrib'd his pow'r?\n     Confin'd to exhibition? All this done\n     Upon the gad? Edmund, how now? What news?\n  Edm. So please your lordship, none.\n                                           [Puts up the letter.]\n  Glou. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?\n  Edm. I know no news, my lord.\n  Glou. What paper were you reading?\n  Edm. Nothing, my lord.\n  Glou. No? What needed then that terrible dispatch of it into\nyour\n     pocket? The quality of nothing hath not such need to hide\n     itself. Let's see. Come, if it be nothing, I shall not need\n     spectacles.\n  Edm. I beseech you, sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my\nbrother\n     that I have not all o'er-read; and for so much as I have \n     perus'd, I find it not fit for your o'erlooking.\n  Glou. Give me the letter, sir.\n  Edm. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The contents,\nas\n     in part I understand them, are to blame.\n  Glou. Let's see, let's see!\n  Edm. I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but\nas\n     an essay or taste of my virtue.\n\n  Glou. (reads) 'This policy and reverence of age makes the world\n     bitter to the best of our times; keeps our fortunes from us\n     till our oldness cannot relish them. I begin to find an idle\n     and fond bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who\nsways,\n     not as it hath power, but as it is suffer'd. Come to me,\nthat\n     of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I\n     wak'd him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and\nlive\n     the beloved of your brother,\n                                                        'EDGAR.'\n\n     Hum! Conspiracy? 'Sleep till I wak'd him, you should enjoy\nhalf\n     his revenue.' My son Edgar! Had he a hand to write this? a\nheart\n     and brain to breed it in? When came this to you? Who brought\nit?\n  Edm. It was not brought me, my lord: there's the cunning of it.\nI \n     found it thrown in at the casement of my closet.\n  Glou. You know the character to be your brother's?\n  Edm. If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear it were\nhis;\n     but in respect of that, I would fain think it were not.\n  Glou. It is his.\n  Edm. It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is not in\nthe\n     contents.\n  Glou. Hath he never before sounded you in this business?\n  Edm. Never, my lord. But I have heard him oft maintain it to be\nfit\n     that, sons at perfect age, and fathers declining, the father\n     should be as ward to the son, and the son manage his\nrevenue.\n  Glou. O villain, villain! His very opinion in the letter!\nAbhorred\n     villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! worse than\n     brutish! Go, sirrah, seek him. I'll apprehend him.\nAbominable\n     villain! Where is he?\n  Edm. I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please you to\nsuspend\n     your indignation against my brother till you can derive from\nhim\n     better testimony of his intent, you should run a certain\ncourse;\n     where, if you violently proceed against him, mistaking his\n     purpose, it would make a great gap in your own honour and\nshake \n     in pieces the heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my\nlife\n     for him that he hath writ this to feel my affection to your\n     honour, and to no other pretence of danger.\n  Glou. Think you so?\n  Edm. If your honour judge it meet, I will place you where you\nshall\n     hear us confer of this and by an auricular assurance have\nyour\n     satisfaction, and that without any further delay than this\nvery\n     evening.\n  Glou. He cannot be such a monster.\n  Edm. Nor is not, sure.\n  Glou. To his father, that so tenderly and entirely loves him.\n     Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him out; wind me into him, I\npray\n     you; frame the business after your own wisdom. I would\nunstate\n     myself to be in a due resolution.\n  Edm. I will seek him, sir, presently; convey the business as I\n     shall find means, and acquaint you withal.\n  Glou. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good\nto\n     us. Though the wisdom of nature can reason it thus and thus,\nyet\n     nature finds itself scourg'd by the sequent effects. Love\ncools,\n     friendship falls off, brothers divide. In cities, mutinies;\nin \n     countries, discord; in palaces, treason; and the bond\ncrack'd\n     'twixt son and father. This villain of mine comes under the\n     prediction; there's son against father: the King falls from\nbias\n     of nature; there's father against child. We have seen the\nbest\n     of our time. Machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all\n     ruinous disorders follow us disquietly to our graves. Find\nout\n     this villain, Edmund; it shall lose thee nothing; do it\n     carefully. And the noble and true-hearted Kent banish'd! his\n     offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.                       Exit.\n  Edm. This is the excellent foppery of the world, that, when we\nare\n     sick in fortune, often the surfeit of our own behaviour, we\nmake\n     guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars; as\nif\n     we were villains on necessity; fools by heavenly compulsion;\n     knaves, thieves, and treachers by spherical pre-dominance;\n     drunkards, liars, and adulterers by an enforc'd obedience of\n     planetary influence; and all that we are evil in, by a\ndivine\n     thrusting on. An admirable evasion of whore-master man, to\nlay\n     his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! My father\n     compounded with my mother under the Dragon's Tail, and my\n     nativity was under Ursa Major, so that it follows I am rough\nand \n     lecherous. Fut! I should have been that I am, had the\n     maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my\nbastardizing.\n     Edgar-\n\n                             Enter Edgar.\n\n     and pat! he comes, like the catastrophe of the old comedy.\nMy\n     cue is villainous melancholy, with a sigh like Tom o'\nBedlam.\n     O, these eclipses do portend these divisions! Fa, sol, la,\nmi.\n  Edg. How now, brother Edmund? What serious contemplation are\nyou\n     in?\n  Edm. I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read this other\nday,\n     what should follow these eclipses.\n  Edg. Do you busy yourself with that?\n  Edm. I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed unhappily:\nas\n     of unnaturalness between the child and the parent; death,\n     dearth, dissolutions of ancient amities; divisions in state,\n     menaces and maledictions against king and nobles; needless\n     diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation of cohorts,\n     nuptial breaches, and I know not what.\n  Edg. How long have you been a sectary astronomical?\n  Edm. Come, come! When saw you my father last? \n  Edg. The night gone by.\n  Edm. Spake you with him?\n  Edg. Ay, two hours together.\n  Edm. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him\nby\n     word or countenance\n  Edg. None at all.\n  Edm. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him; and at\nmy\n     entreaty forbear his presence until some little time hath\n     qualified the heat of his displeasure, which at this instant\nso\n     rageth in him that with the mischief of your person it would\n     scarcely allay.\n  Edg. Some villain hath done me wrong.\n  Edm. That's my fear. I pray you have a continent forbearance\ntill\n     the speed of his rage goes slower; and, as I say, retire\nwith me\n     to my lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to hear my\n     lord speak. Pray ye, go! There's my key. If you do stir\nabroad,\n     go arm'd.\n  Edg. Arm'd, brother?\n  Edm. Brother, I advise you to the best. Go arm'd. I am no\nhonest man\n     if there be any good meaning toward you. I have told you\nwhat I \n     have seen and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image and\n     horror of it. Pray you, away!\n  Edg. Shall I hear from you anon?\n  Edm. I do serve you in this business.\n                                                     Exit Edgar.\n     A credulous father! and a brother noble,\n     Whose nature is so far from doing harms\n     That he suspects none; on whose foolish honesty\n     My practices ride easy! I see the business.\n     Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit;\n     All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.\nExit.\n\n\n\n\nScene III.\nThe Duke of Albany's Palace.\n\nEnter Goneril and [her] Steward [Oswald].\n\n  Gon. Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?\n  Osw. Ay, madam.\n  Gon. By day and night, he wrongs me! Every hour\n     He flashes into one gross crime or other\n     That sets us all at odds. I'll not endure it.\n     His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us\n     On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,\n     I will not speak with him. Say I am sick.\n     If you come slack of former services,\n     You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.\n                                                 [Horns within.]\n  Osw. He's coming, madam; I hear him.\n  Gon. Put on what weary negligence you please,\n     You and your fellows. I'd have it come to question.\n     If he distaste it, let him to our sister,\n     Whose mind and mine I know in that are one,\n     Not to be overrul'd. Idle old man, \n     That still would manage those authorities\n     That he hath given away! Now, by my life,\n     Old fools are babes again, and must be us'd\n     With checks as flatteries, when they are seen abus'd.\n     Remember what I have said.\n  Osw. Very well, madam.\n  Gon. And let his knights have colder looks among you.\n     What grows of it, no matter. Advise your fellows so.\n     I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,\n     That I may speak. I'll write straight to my sister\n     To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene IV.\nThe Duke of Albany's Palace.\n\nEnter Kent, [disguised].\n\n  Kent. If but as well I other accents borrow,\n     That can my speech defuse, my good intent\n     May carry through itself to that full issue\n     For which I raz'd my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,\n     If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,\n     So may it come, thy master, whom thou lov'st,\n     Shall find thee full of labours.\n\n         Horns within. Enter Lear, [Knights,] and Attendants.\n\n  Lear. Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready. [Exit\n     an Attendant.] How now? What art thou?\n  Kent. A man, sir.\n  Lear. What dost thou profess? What wouldst thou with us?\n  Kent. I do profess to be no less than I seem, to serve him\ntruly\n     that will put me in trust, to love him that is honest, to\n     converse with him that is wise and says little, to fear \n     judgment, to fight when I cannot choose, and to eat no fish.\n  Lear. What art thou?\n  Kent. A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the King.\n  Lear. If thou be'st as poor for a subject as he's for a king,\nthou\n     art poor enough. What wouldst thou?\n  Kent. Service.\n  Lear. Who wouldst thou serve?\n  Kent. You.\n  Lear. Dost thou know me, fellow?\n  Kent. No, sir; but you have that in your countenance which I\nwould\n     fain call master.\n  Lear. What's that?\n  Kent. Authority.\n  Lear. What services canst thou do?\n  Kent. I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious tale\nin\n     telling it and deliver a plain message bluntly. That which\n     ordinary men are fit for, I am qualified in, and the best of\nme\n     is diligence.\n  Lear. How old art thou?\n  Kent. Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor so\nold to \n     dote on her for anything. I have years on my back\nforty-eight.\n  Lear. Follow me; thou shalt serve me. If I like thee no worse\nafter\n     dinner, I will not part from thee yet. Dinner, ho, dinner!\n     Where's my knave? my fool? Go you and call my fool hither.\n\n                                            [Exit an attendant.]\n\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\n\n     You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?\n  Osw. So please you-                                      Exit.\n  Lear. What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.\n     [Exit a Knight.] Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's\n     asleep.\n\n                            [Enter Knight]\n\n     How now? Where's that mongrel?\n  Knight. He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.\n  Lear. Why came not the slave back to me when I call'd him? \n  Knight. Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would\nnot.\n  Lear. He would not?\n  Knight. My lord, I know not what the matter is; but to my\njudgment\n     your Highness is not entertain'd with that ceremonious\naffection\n     as you were wont. There's a great abatement of kindness\nappears\n     as well in the general dependants as in the Duke himself\nalso\n     and your daughter.\n  Lear. Ha! say'st thou so?\n  Knight. I beseech you pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken; for\n     my duty cannot be silent when I think your Highness wrong'd.\n  Lear. Thou but rememb'rest me of mine own conception. I have\n     perceived a most faint neglect of late, which I have rather\n     blamed as mine own jealous curiosity than as a very pretence\n     and purpose of unkindness. I will look further into't. But\n     where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days.\n  Knight. Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the fool\n     hath much pined away.\n  Lear. No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you and tell my\n     daughter I would speak with her. [Exit Knight.] Go you, call\n     hither my fool. \n                                            [Exit an Attendant.]\n\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\n\n     O, you, sir, you! Come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir?\n  Osw. My lady's father.\n  Lear. 'My lady's father'? My lord's knave! You whoreson dog!\nyou\n     slave! you cur!\n  Osw. I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.\n  Lear. Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?\n                                                  [Strikes him.]\n  Osw. I'll not be strucken, my lord.\n  Kent. Nor tripp'd neither, you base football player?\n                                            [Trips up his heels.\n  Lear. I thank thee, fellow. Thou serv'st me, and I'll love\nthee.\n  Kent. Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences. Away,\n     away! If you will measure your lubber's length again, tarry;\nbut\n     away! Go to! Have you wisdom? So.\n                                               [Pushes him out.]\n  Lear. Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee. There's earnest of\nthy \n     service.                                     [Gives money.]\n\n                             Enter Fool.\n\n  Fool. Let me hire him too. Here's my coxcomb.\n                                          [Offers Kent his cap.]\n  Lear. How now, my pretty knave? How dost thou?\n  Fool. Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.\n  Kent. Why, fool?\n  Fool. Why? For taking one's part that's out of favour. Nay, an\nthou\n     canst not smile as the wind sits, thou'lt catch cold\nshortly.\n     There, take my coxcomb! Why, this fellow hath banish'd two\non's\n     daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If\n     thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.- How now,\n     nuncle? Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!\n  Lear. Why, my boy?\n  Fool. If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs\nmyself.\n     There's mine! beg another of thy daughters.\n  Lear. Take heed, sirrah- the whip.\n  Fool. Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipp'd out,\nwhen \n     Lady the brach may stand by th' fire and stink.\n  Lear. A pestilent gall to me!\n  Fool. Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.\n  Lear. Do.\n  Fool. Mark it, nuncle.\n          Have more than thou showest,\n          Speak less than thou knowest,\n          Lend less than thou owest,\n          Ride more than thou goest,\n          Learn more than thou trowest,\n          Set less than thou throwest;\n          Leave thy drink and thy whore,\n          And keep in-a-door,\n          And thou shalt have more\n          Than two tens to a score.\n  Kent. This is nothing, fool.\n  Fool. Then 'tis like the breath of an unfeed lawyer- you gave\nme\n     nothing for't. Can you make no use of nothing, nuncle?\n  Lear. Why, no, boy. Nothing can be made out of nothing.\n  Fool. [to Kent] Prithee tell him, so much the rent of his land \n     comes to. He will not believe a fool.\n  Lear. A bitter fool!\n  Fool. Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a bitter\n     fool and a sweet fool?\n  Lear. No, lad; teach me.\n  Fool.   That lord that counsell'd thee\n            To give away thy land,\n          Come place him here by me-\n            Do thou for him stand.\n          The sweet and bitter fool\n            Will presently appear;\n          The one in motley here,\n            The other found out there.\n  Lear. Dost thou call me fool, boy?\n  Fool. All thy other titles thou hast given away; that thou wast\n     born with.\n  Kent. This is not altogether fool, my lord.\n  Fool. No, faith; lords and great men will not let me. If I had\na\n     monopoly out, they would have part on't. And ladies too,\nthey\n     will not let me have all the fool to myself; they'll be \n     snatching. Give me an egg, nuncle, and I'll give thee two\n     crowns.\n  Lear. What two crowns shall they be?\n  Fool. Why, after I have cut the egg i' th' middle and eat up\nthe\n     meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou clovest thy crown\ni'\n     th' middle and gav'st away both parts, thou bor'st thine ass\non\n     thy back o'er the dirt. Thou hadst little wit in thy bald\ncrown\n     when thou gav'st thy golden one away. If I speak like myself\nin\n     this, let him be whipp'd that first finds it so.\n\n     [Sings]    Fools had ne'er less grace in a year,\n                  For wise men are grown foppish;\n                They know not how their wits to wear,\n                  Their manners are so apish.\n\n  Lear. When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?\n  Fool. I have us'd it, nuncle, ever since thou mad'st thy\ndaughters\n     thy mother; for when thou gav'st them the rod, and put'st\ndown\n     thine own breeches,\n \n     [Sings]    Then they for sudden joy did weep,\n                  And I for sorrow sung,\n                That such a king should play bo-peep\n                  And go the fools among.\n\n     Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool\nto\n     lie. I would fain learn to lie.\n  Lear. An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipp'd.\n  Fool. I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are. They'll\nhave me\n     whipp'd for speaking true; thou'lt have me whipp'd for\nlying;\n     and sometimes I am whipp'd for holding my peace. I had\nrather be\n     any kind o' thing than a fool! And yet I would not be thee,\n     nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides and left\nnothing\n     i' th' middle. Here comes one o' the parings.\n\n                            Enter Goneril.\n\n  Lear. How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks\nyou\n     are too much o' late i' th' frown.\n  Fool. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care\nfor \n     her frowning. Now thou art an O without a figure. I am\nbetter\n     than thou art now: I am a fool, thou art nothing.\n     [To Goneril] Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your\nface\n     bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum!\n\n            He that keeps nor crust nor crum,\n            Weary of all, shall want some.-\n\n     [Points at Lear] That's a sheal'd peascod.\n  Gon. Not only, sir, this your all-licens'd fool,\n     But other of your insolent retinue\n     Do hourly carp and quarrel, breaking forth\n     In rank and not-to-be-endured riots. Sir,\n     I had thought, by making this well known unto you,\n     To have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful,\n     By what yourself, too, late have spoke and done,\n     That you protect this course, and put it on\n     By your allowance; which if you should, the fault\n     Would not scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,\n     Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal, \n     Might in their working do you that offence\n     Which else were shame, that then necessity\n     Must call discreet proceeding.\n  Fool. For you know, nuncle,\n\n          The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long\n          That it had it head bit off by it young.\n\n     So out went the candle, and we were left darkling.\n  Lear. Are you our daughter?\n  Gon. Come, sir,\n     I would you would make use of that good wisdom\n     Whereof I know you are fraught, and put away\n     These dispositions that of late transform you\n     From what you rightly are.\n  Fool. May not an ass know when the cart draws the horse?\n     Whoop, Jug, I love thee!\n  Lear. Doth any here know me? This is not Lear.\n     Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?\n     Either his notion weakens, his discernings \n     Are lethargied- Ha! waking? 'Tis not so!\n     Who is it that can tell me who I am?\n  Fool. Lear's shadow.\n  Lear. I would learn that; for, by the marks of sovereignty,\n     Knowledge, and reason, I should be false persuaded\n     I had daughters.\n  Fool. Which they will make an obedient father.\n  Lear. Your name, fair gentlewoman?\n  Gon. This admiration, sir, is much o' th' savour\n     Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you\n     To understand my purposes aright.\n     As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.\n     Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;\n     Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd, and bold\n     That this our court, infected with their manners,\n     Shows like a riotous inn. Epicurism and lust\n     Make it more like a tavern or a brothel\n     Than a grac'd palace. The shame itself doth speak\n     For instant remedy. Be then desir'd\n     By her that else will take the thing she begs \n     A little to disquantity your train,\n     And the remainder that shall still depend\n     To be such men as may besort your age,\n     Which know themselves, and you.\n  Lear. Darkness and devils!\n     Saddle my horses! Call my train together!\n     Degenerate bastard, I'll not trouble thee;\n     Yet have I left a daughter.\n  Gon. You strike my people, and your disorder'd rabble\n     Make servants of their betters.\n\n                            Enter Albany.\n\n  Lear. Woe that too late repents!- O, sir, are you come?\n     Is it your will? Speak, sir!- Prepare my horses.\n     Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,\n     More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child\n     Than the sea-monster!\n  Alb. Pray, sir, be patient.\n  Lear. [to Goneril] Detested kite, thou liest! \n     My train are men of choice and rarest parts,\n     That all particulars of duty know\n     And in the most exact regard support\n     The worships of their name.- O most small fault,\n     How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!\n     Which, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature\n     From the fix'd place; drew from my heart all love\n     And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!\n     Beat at this gate that let thy folly in  [Strikes his head.]\n     And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.\n  Alb. My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant\n     Of what hath mov'd you.\n  Lear. It may be so, my lord.\n     Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!\n     Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend\n     To make this creature fruitful.\n     Into her womb convey sterility;\n     Dry up in her the organs of increase;\n     And from her derogate body never spring\n     A babe to honour her! If she must teem, \n     Create her child of spleen, that it may live\n     And be a thwart disnatur'd torment to her.\n     Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,\n     With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,\n     Turn all her mother's pains and benefits\n     To laughter and contempt, that she may feel\n     How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is\n     To have a thankless child! Away, away!                Exit.\n  Alb. Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?\n  Gon. Never afflict yourself to know the cause;\n     But let his disposition have that scope\n     That dotage gives it.\n\n                             Enter Lear.\n\n  Lear. What, fifty of my followers at a clap?\n     Within a fortnight?\n  Alb. What's the matter, sir?\n  Lear. I'll tell thee. [To Goneril] Life and death! I am asham'd\n     That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus; \n     That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,\n     Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!\n     Th' untented woundings of a father's curse\n     Pierce every sense about thee!- Old fond eyes,\n     Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,\n     And cast you, with the waters that you lose,\n     To temper clay. Yea, is it come to this?\n     Let it be so. Yet have I left a daughter,\n     Who I am sure is kind and comfortable.\n     When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails\n     She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find\n     That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think\n     I have cast off for ever; thou shalt, I warrant thee.\n                            Exeunt [Lear, Kent, and Attendants].\n  Gon. Do you mark that, my lord?\n  Alb. I cannot be so partial, Goneril,\n     To the great love I bear you -\n  Gon. Pray you, content.- What, Oswald, ho!\n     [To the Fool] You, sir, more knave than fool, after your\nmaster!\n  Fool. Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry! Take the fool with thee.\n\n\n          A fox when one has caught her,\n          And such a daughter,\n          Should sure to the slaughter,\n          If my cap would buy a halter.\n          So the fool follows after.                       Exit.\n  Gon. This man hath had good counsel! A hundred knights?\n     'Tis politic and safe to let him keep\n     At point a hundred knights; yes, that on every dream,\n     Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,\n     He may enguard his dotage with their pow'rs\n     And hold our lives in mercy.- Oswald, I say!\n  Alb. Well, you may fear too far.\n  Gon. Safer than trust too far.\n     Let me still take away the harms I fear,\n     Not fear still to be taken. I know his heart.\n     What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister.\n     If she sustain him and his hundred knights,\n     When I have show'd th' unfitness-\n \n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\n\n     How now, Oswald?\n     What, have you writ that letter to my sister?\n  Osw. Yes, madam.\n  Gon. Take you some company, and away to horse!\n     Inform her full of my particular fear,\n     And thereto add such reasons of your own\n     As may compact it more. Get you gone,\n     And hasten your return. [Exit Oswald.] No, no, my lord!\n     This milky gentleness and course of yours,\n     Though I condemn it not, yet, under pardon,\n     You are much more at task for want of wisdom\n     Than prais'd for harmful mildness.\n  Alb. How far your eyes may pierce I cannot tell.\n     Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.\n  Gon. Nay then-\n  Alb. Well, well; th' event.                            Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene V.\nCourt before the Duke of Albany's Palace.\n\nEnter Lear, Kent, and Fool.\n\n  Lear. Go you before to Gloucester with these letters. Acquaint\nmy\n     daughter no further with anything you know than comes from\nher\n     demand out of the letter. If your diligence be not speedy, I\n     shall be there afore you.\n  Kent. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your\nletter.\nExit.\n  Fool. If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in danger\nof\n     kibes?\n  Lear. Ay, boy.\n  Fool. Then I prithee be merry. Thy wit shall ne'er go\nslip-shod.\n  Lear. Ha, ha, ha!\n  Fool. Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly; for\nthough\n     she's as like this as a crab's like an apple, yet I can tell\n     what I can tell.\n  Lear. What canst tell, boy?\n  Fool. She'll taste as like this as a crab does to a crab. Thou\n     canst tell why one's nose stands i' th' middle on's face? \n  Lear. No.\n  Fool. Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose, that what\na\n     man cannot smell out, 'a may spy into.\n  Lear. I did her wrong.\n  Fool. Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?\n  Lear. No.\n  Fool. Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.\n  Lear. Why?\n  Fool. Why, to put's head in; not to give it away to his\ndaughters,\n     and leave his horns without a case.\n  Lear. I will forget my nature. So kind a father!- Be my horses\n     ready?\n  Fool. Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the seven\nstars\n     are no moe than seven is a pretty reason.\n  Lear. Because they are not eight?\n  Fool. Yes indeed. Thou wouldst make a good fool.\n  Lear. To tak't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!\n  Fool. If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten for\nbeing\n     old before thy time.\n  Lear. How's that? \n  Fool. Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst been\nwise.\n  Lear. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven!\n     Keep me in temper; I would not be mad!\n\n                         [Enter a Gentleman.]\n\n     How now? Are the horses ready?\n  Gent. Ready, my lord.\n  Lear. Come, boy.\n  Fool.

Scene I.\nA court within the Castle of the Earl of Gloucester.\n\nEnter [Edmund the] Bastard and Curan, meeting.\n\n  Edm. Save thee, Curan.\n  Cur. And you, sir. I have been with your father, and given him\n     notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan his Duchess will\nbe\n     here with him this night.\n  Edm. How comes that?\n  Cur. Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad- I mean\nthe\n     whisper'd ones, for they are yet but ear-kissing arguments?\n  Edm. Not I. Pray you, what are they?\n  Cur. Have you heard of no likely wars toward 'twixt the two\nDukes\n     of Cornwall and Albany?\n  Edm. Not a word.\n  Cur. You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.      Exit.\n  Edm. The Duke be here to-night? The better! best!\n     This weaves itself perforce into my business.\n     My father hath set guard to take my brother;\n     And I have one thing, of a queasy question,\n     Which I must act. Briefness and fortune, work! \n     Brother, a word! Descend! Brother, I say!\n\n                             Enter Edgar.\n\n     My father watches. O sir, fly this place!\n     Intelligence is given where you are hid.\n     You have now the good advantage of the night.\n     Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?\n     He's coming hither; now, i' th' night, i' th' haste,\n     And Regan with him. Have you nothing said\n     Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?\n     Advise yourself.\n  Edg. I am sure on't, not a word.\n  Edm. I hear my father coming. Pardon me!\n     In cunning I must draw my sword upon you.\n     Draw, seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.-\n     Yield! Come before my father. Light, ho, here!\n     Fly, brother.- Torches, torches!- So farewell.\n                                                     Exit Edgar.\n     Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion \n     Of my more fierce endeavour. [Stabs his arm.] I have seen\n        drunkards\n     Do more than this in sport.- Father, father!-\n     Stop, stop! No help?\n\n             Enter Gloucester, and Servants with torches.\n\n  Glou. Now, Edmund, where's the villain?\n  Edm. Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,\n     Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon\n     To stand 's auspicious mistress.\n  Glou. But where is he?\n  Edm. Look, sir, I bleed.\n  Glou. Where is the villain, Edmund?\n  Edm. Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could-\n  Glou. Pursue him, ho! Go after.        [Exeunt some Servants].\n     By no means what?\n  Edm. Persuade me to the murther of your lordship;\n     But that I told him the revenging gods\n     'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend; \n     Spoke with how manifold and strong a bond\n     The child was bound to th' father- sir, in fine,\n     Seeing how loathly opposite I stood\n     To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion\n     With his prepared sword he charges home\n     My unprovided body, lanch'd mine arm;\n     But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,\n     Bold in the quarrel's right, rous'd to th' encounter,\n     Or whether gasted by the noise I made,\n     Full suddenly he fled.\n  Glou. Let him fly far.\n     Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;\n     And found- dispatch. The noble Duke my master,\n     My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night.\n     By his authority I will proclaim it\n     That he which find, him shall deserve our thanks,\n     Bringing the murderous caitiff to the stake;\n     He that conceals him, death.\n  Edm. When I dissuaded him from his intent\n     And found him pight to do it, with curst speech \n     I threaten'd to discover him. He replied,\n     'Thou unpossessing bastard, dost thou think,\n     If I would stand against thee, would the reposal\n     Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee\n     Make thy words faith'd? No. What I should deny\n     (As this I would; ay, though thou didst produce\n     My very character), I'ld turn it all\n     To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practice;\n     And thou must make a dullard of the world,\n     If they not thought the profits of my death\n     Were very pregnant and potential spurs\n     To make thee seek it.'\n  Glou. Strong and fast'ned villain!\n     Would he deny his letter? I never got him.\n                                                  Tucket within.\n     Hark, the Duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.\n     All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not scape;\n     The Duke must grant me that. Besides, his picture\n     I will send far and near, that all the kingdom\n     May have due note of him, and of my land, \n     Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means\n     To make thee capable.\n\n                Enter Cornwall, Regan, and Attendants.\n\n  Corn. How now, my noble friend? Since I came hither\n     (Which I can call but now) I have heard strange news.\n  Reg. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short\n     Which can pursue th' offender. How dost, my lord?\n  Glou. O madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!\n  Reg. What, did my father's godson seek your life?\n     He whom my father nam'd? Your Edgar?\n  Glou. O lady, lady, shame would have it hid!\n  Reg. Was he not companion with the riotous knights\n     That tend upon my father?\n  Glou. I know not, madam. 'Tis too bad, too bad!\n  Edm. Yes, madam, he was of that consort.\n  Reg. No marvel then though he were ill affected.\n     'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,\n     To have th' expense and waste of his revenues. \n     I have this present evening from my sister\n     Been well inform'd of them, and with such cautions\n     That, if they come to sojourn at my house,\n     I'll not be there.\n  Corn. Nor I, assure thee, Regan.\n     Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father\n     A childlike office.\n  Edm. 'Twas my duty, sir.\n  Glou. He did bewray his practice, and receiv'd\n     This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.\n  Corn. Is he pursued?\n  Glou. Ay, my good lord.\n  Corn. If he be taken, he shall never more\n     Be fear'd of doing harm. Make your own purpose,\n     How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,\n     Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant\n     So much commend itself, you shall be ours.\n     Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;\n     You we first seize on.\n  Edm. I shall serve you, sir, \n     Truly, however else.\n  Glou. For him I thank your Grace.\n  Corn. You know not why we came to visit you-\n  Reg. Thus out of season, threading dark-ey'd night.\n     Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,\n     Wherein we must have use of your advice.\n     Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,\n     Of differences, which I best thought it fit\n     To answer from our home. The several messengers\n     From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,\n     Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow\n     Your needful counsel to our business,\n     Which craves the instant use.\n  Glou. I serve you, madam.\n     Your Graces are right welcome.\n                                               Exeunt. Flourish.\n\n\n\n\nScene II.\nBefore Gloucester's Castle.\n\nEnter Kent and [Oswald the] Steward, severally.\n\n  Osw. Good dawning to thee, friend. Art of this house?\n  Kent. Ay.\n  Osw. Where may we set our horses?\n  Kent. I' th' mire.\n  Osw. Prithee, if thou lov'st me, tell me.\n  Kent. I love thee not.\n  Osw. Why then, I care not for thee.\n  Kent. If I had thee in Lipsbury Pinfold, I would make thee care\nfor\n     me.\n  Osw. Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.\n  Kent. Fellow, I know thee.\n  Osw. What dost thou know me for?\n  Kent. A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a base,\nproud,\n     shallow, beggarly, three-suited, hundred-pound, filthy,\n     worsted-stocking knave; a lily-liver'd, action-taking,\nwhoreson,\n     glass-gazing, superserviceable, finical rogue;\n     one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a bawd in\nway of\n     good service, and art nothing but the composition of a\nknave, \n     beggar, coward, pander, and the son and heir of a mongrel\nbitch;\n     one whom I will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deny\nthe\n     least syllable of thy addition.\n  Osw. Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail on one\n     that's neither known of thee nor knows thee!\n  Kent. What a brazen-fac'd varlet art thou, to deny thou knowest\nme!\n     Is it two days ago since I beat thee and tripp'd up thy\nheels\n     before the King? [Draws his sword.] Draw, you rogue! for,\nthough\n     it be night, yet the moon shines. I'll make a sop o' th'\n     moonshine o' you. Draw, you whoreson cullionly barbermonger!\n     draw!\n  Osw. Away! I have nothing to do with thee.\n  Kent. Draw, you rascal! You come with letters against the King,\nand\n     take Vanity the puppet's part against the royalty of her\nfather.\n     Draw, you rogue, or I'll so carbonado your shanks! Draw, you\n     rascal! Come your ways!\n  Osw. Help, ho! murther! help!\n  Kent. Strike, you slave! Stand, rogue! Stand, you neat slave!\n     Strike!                                        [Beats him.] \n  Osw. Help, ho! murther! murther!\n\n      Enter Edmund, with his rapier drawn, Gloucester, Cornwall,\n                           Regan, Servants.\n\n  Edm. How now? What's the matter?                 Parts [them].\n  Kent. With you, goodman boy, an you please! Come, I'll flesh\nye!\n     Come on, young master!\n  Glou. Weapons? arms? What's the matter here?\n  Corn. Keep peace, upon your lives!\n     He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?\n  Reg. The messengers from our sister and the King\n  Corn. What is your difference? Speak.\n  Osw. I am scarce in breath, my lord.\n  Kent. No marvel, you have so bestirr'd your valour. You\ncowardly\n     rascal, nature disclaims in thee; a tailor made thee.\n  Corn. Thou art a strange fellow. A tailor make a man?\n  Kent. Ay, a tailor, sir. A stonecutter or a painter could not\nhave\n     made him so ill, though he had been but two hours at the\ntrade.\n  Corn. Speak yet, how grew your quarrel? \n  Osw. This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spar'd\n     At suit of his grey beard-\n  Kent. Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My lord, if\n     you'll give me leave, I will tread this unbolted villain\ninto\n     mortar and daub the walls of a jakes with him. 'Spare my\ngrey\n     beard,' you wagtail?\n  Corn. Peace, sirrah!\n     You beastly knave, know you no reverence?\n  Kent. Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege.\n  Corn. Why art thou angry?\n  Kent. That such a slave as this should wear a sword,\n     Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,\n     Like rats, oft bite the holy cords atwain\n     Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion\n     That in the natures of their lords rebel,\n     Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;\n     Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks\n     With every gale and vary of their masters,\n     Knowing naught (like dogs) but following.\n     A plague upon your epileptic visage! \n     Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?\n     Goose, an I had you upon Sarum Plain,\n     I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.\n  Corn. What, art thou mad, old fellow?\n  Glou. How fell you out? Say that.\n  Kent. No contraries hold more antipathy\n     Than I and such a knave.\n  Corn. Why dost thou call him knave? What is his fault?\n  Kent. His countenance likes me not.\n  Corn. No more perchance does mine, or his, or hers.\n  Kent. Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain.\n     I have seen better faces in my time\n     Than stands on any shoulder that I see\n     Before me at this instant.\n  Corn. This is some fellow\n     Who, having been prais'd for bluntness, doth affect\n     A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb\n     Quite from his nature. He cannot flatter, he!\n     An honest mind and plain- he must speak truth!\n     An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain. \n     These kind of knaves I know which in this plainness\n     Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends\n     Than twenty silly-ducking observants\n     That stretch their duties nicely.\n  Kent. Sir, in good faith, in sincere verity,\n     Under th' allowance of your great aspect,\n     Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire\n     On flickering Phoebus' front-\n  Corn. What mean'st by this?\n  Kent. To go out of my dialect, which you discommend so much. I\n     know, sir, I am no flatterer. He that beguil'd you in a\nplain\n     accent was a plain knave, which, for my part, I will not be,\n     though I should win your displeasure to entreat me to't.\n  Corn. What was th' offence you gave him?\n  Osw. I never gave him any.\n     It pleas'd the King his master very late\n     To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;\n     When he, conjunct, and flattering his displeasure,\n     Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd\n     And put upon him such a deal of man \n     That worthied him, got praises of the King\n     For him attempting who was self-subdu'd;\n     And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,\n     Drew on me here again.\n  Kent. None of these rogues and cowards\n     But Ajax is their fool.\n  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks!\n     You stubborn ancient knave, you reverent braggart,\n     We'll teach you-\n  Kent. Sir, I am too old to learn.\n     Call not your stocks for me. I serve the King;\n     On whose employment I was sent to you.\n     You shall do small respect, show too bold malice\n     Against the grace and person of my master,\n     Stocking his messenger.\n  Corn. Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,\n     There shall he sit till noon.\n  Reg. Till noon? Till night, my lord, and all night too!\n  Kent. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,\n     You should not use me so. \n  Reg. Sir, being his knave, I will.\n  Corn. This is a fellow of the selfsame colour\n     Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!\n                                             Stocks brought out.\n  Glou. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so.\n     His fault is much, and the good King his master\n     Will check him for't. Your purpos'd low correction\n     Is such as basest and contemn'dest wretches\n     For pilf'rings and most common trespasses\n     Are punish'd with. The King must take it ill\n     That he, so slightly valued in his messenger,\n     Should have him thus restrain'd.\n  Corn. I'll answer that.\n  Reg. My sister may receive it much more worse,\n     To have her gentleman abus'd, assaulted,\n     For following her affairs. Put in his legs.-\n                                    [Kent is put in the stocks.]\n     Come, my good lord, away.\n                           Exeunt [all but Gloucester and Kent].\n  Glou. I am sorry for thee, friend. 'Tis the Duke's pleasure, \n     Whose disposition, all the world well knows,\n     Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd. I'll entreat for thee.\n  Kent. Pray do not, sir. I have watch'd and travell'd hard.\n     Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.\n     A good man's fortune may grow out at heels.\n     Give you good morrow!\n  Glou. The Duke 's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.\nExit.\n  Kent. Good King, that must approve the common saw,\n     Thou out of heaven's benediction com'st\n     To the warm sun!\n     Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,\n     That by thy comfortable beams I may\n     Peruse this letter. Nothing almost sees miracles\n     But misery. I know 'tis from Cordelia,\n     Who hath most fortunately been inform'd\n     Of my obscured course- and [reads] 'shall find time\n     From this enormous state, seeking to give\n     Losses their remedies'- All weary and o'erwatch'd,\n     Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold \n     This shameful lodging.\n     Fortune, good night; smile once more, turn thy wheel.\n                                                         Sleeps.\n\n\n\n\nScene III.\nThe open country.\n\nEnter Edgar.\n\n  Edg. I heard myself proclaim'd,\n     And by the happy hollow of a tree\n     Escap'd the hunt. No port is free, no place\n     That guard and most unusual vigilance\n     Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may scape,\n     I will preserve myself; and am bethought\n     To take the basest and most poorest shape\n     That ever penury, in contempt of man,\n     Brought near to beast. My face I'll grime with filth,\n     Blanket my loins, elf all my hair in knots,\n     And with presented nakedness outface\n     The winds and persecutions of the sky.\n     The country gives me proof and precedent\n     Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,\n     Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms\n     Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;\n     And with this horrible object, from low farms, \n     Poor pelting villages, sheepcotes, and mills,\n     Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,\n     Enforce their charity. 'Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!'\n     That's something yet! Edgar I nothing am.             Exit.\n\n\n\n\nScene IV.\nBefore Gloucester's Castle; Kent in the stocks.\n\nEnter Lear, Fool, and Gentleman.\n\n  Lear. 'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,\n     And not send back my messenger.\n  Gent. As I learn'd,\n     The night before there was no purpose in them\n     Of this remove.\n  Kent. Hail to thee, noble master!\n  Lear. Ha!\n     Mak'st thou this shame thy pastime?\n  Kent. No, my lord.\n  Fool. Ha, ha! look! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by\nthe\n     head, dogs and bears by th' neck, monkeys by th' loins, and\nmen\n     by th' legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears\n     wooden nether-stocks.\n  Lear. What's he that hath so much thy place mistook\n     To set thee here?\n  Kent. It is both he and she-\n     Your son and daughter. \n  Lear. No.\n  Kent. Yes.\n  Lear. No, I say.\n  Kent. I say yea.\n  Lear. No, no, they would not!\n  Kent. Yes, they have.\n  Lear. By Jupiter, I swear no!\n  Kent. By Juno, I swear ay!\n  Lear. They durst not do't;\n     They would not, could not do't. 'Tis worse than murther\n     To do upon respect such violent outrage.\n     Resolve me with all modest haste which way\n     Thou mightst deserve or they impose this usage,\n     Coming from us.\n  Kent. My lord, when at their home\n     I did commend your Highness' letters to them,\n     Ere I was risen from the place that show'd\n     My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,\n     Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth\n     From Goneril his mistress salutations; \n     Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,\n     Which presently they read; on whose contents,\n     They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse,\n     Commanded me to follow and attend\n     The leisure of their answer, gave me cold looks,\n     And meeting here the other messenger,\n     Whose welcome I perceiv'd had poison'd mine-\n     Being the very fellow which of late\n     Display'd so saucily against your Highness-\n     Having more man than wit about me, drew.\n     He rais'd the house with loud and coward cries.\n     Your son and daughter found this trespass worth\n     The shame which here it suffers.\n  Fool. Winter's not gone yet, if the wild geese fly that way.\n\n          Fathers that wear rags\n            Do make their children blind;\n          But fathers that bear bags\n            Shall see their children kind.\n          Fortune, that arrant whore, \n          Ne'er turns the key to th' poor.\n\n     But for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours for thy\n     daughters as thou canst tell in a year.\n  Lear. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!\n     Hysterica passio! Down, thou climbing sorrow!\n     Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?\n  Kent. With the Earl, sir, here within.\n  Lear. Follow me not;\n     Stay here.                                            Exit.\n  Gent. Made you no more offence but what you speak of?\n  Kent. None.\n     How chance the King comes with so small a number?\n  Fool. An thou hadst been set i' th' stocks for that question,\n     thou'dst well deserv'd it.\n  Kent. Why, fool?\n  Fool. We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee there's\nno\n     labouring i' th' winter. All that follow their noses are led\nby\n     their eyes but blind men, and there's not a nose among\ntwenty\n     but can smell him that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a\ngreat \n     wheel runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with\nfollowing\n     it; but the great one that goes upward, let him draw thee\nafter.\n     When a wise man gives thee better counsel, give me mine\nagain. I\n     would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.\n          That sir which serves and seeks for gain,\n            And follows but for form,\n          Will pack when it begins to rain\n            And leave thee in the storm.\n          But I will tarry; the fool will stay,\n            And let the wise man fly.\n          The knave turns fool that runs away;\n            The fool no knave, perdy.\n  Kent. Where learn'd you this, fool?\n  Fool. Not i' th' stocks, fool.\n\n                      Enter Lear and Gloucester\n\n  Lear. Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?\n     They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches-\n     The images of revolt and flying off! \n     Fetch me a better answer.\n  Glou. My dear lord,\n     You know the fiery quality of the Duke,\n     How unremovable and fix'd he is\n     In his own course.\n  Lear. Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!\n     Fiery? What quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,\n     I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.\n  Glou. Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.\n  Lear. Inform'd them? Dost thou understand me, man?\n  Glou. Ay, my good lord.\n  Lear. The King would speak with Cornwall; the dear father\n     Would with his daughter speak, commands her service.\n     Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!\n     Fiery? the fiery Duke? Tell the hot Duke that-\n     No, but not yet! May be he is not well.\n     Infirmity doth still neglect all office\n     Whereto our health is bound. We are not ourselves\n     When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind\n     To suffer with the body. I'll forbear; \n     And am fallen out with my more headier will,\n     To take the indispos'd and sickly fit\n     For the sound man.- Death on my state! Wherefore\n     Should be sit here? This act persuades me\n     That this remotion of the Duke and her\n     Is practice only. Give me my servant forth.\n     Go tell the Duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them-\n     Now, presently. Bid them come forth and hear me,\n     Or at their chamber door I'll beat the drum\n     Till it cry sleep to death.\n  Glou. I would have all well betwixt you.                 Exit.\n  Lear. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But down!\n  Fool. Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels when\nshe\n     put 'em i' th' paste alive. She knapp'd 'em o' th' coxcombs\nwith\n     a stick and cried 'Down, wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother\nthat,\n     in pure kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.\n\n             Enter Cornwall, Regan, Gloucester, Servants.\n\n  Lear. Good morrow to you both. \n  Corn. Hail to your Grace!\n                                       Kent here set at liberty.\n  Reg. I am glad to see your Highness.\n  Lear. Regan, I think you are; I know what reason\n     I have to think so. If thou shouldst not be glad,\n     I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,\n     Sepulchring an adultress. [To Kent] O, are you free?\n     Some other time for that.- Beloved Regan,\n     Thy sister's naught. O Regan, she hath tied\n     Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here!\n                                   [Lays his hand on his heart.]\n     I can scarce speak to thee. Thou'lt not believe\n     With how deprav'd a quality- O Regan!\n  Reg. I pray you, sir, take patience. I have hope\n     You less know how to value her desert\n     Than she to scant her duty.\n  Lear. Say, how is that?\n  Reg. I cannot think my sister in the least\n     Would fail her obligation. If, sir, perchance\n     She have restrain'd the riots of your followers, \n     'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,\n     As clears her from all blame.\n  Lear. My curses on her!\n  Reg. O, sir, you are old!\n     Nature in you stands on the very verge\n     Of her confine. You should be rul'd, and led\n     By some discretion that discerns your state\n     Better than you yourself. Therefore I pray you\n     That to our sister you do make return;\n     Say you have wrong'd her, sir.\n  Lear. Ask her forgiveness?\n     Do you but mark how this becomes the house:\n     'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old.          [Kneels.]\n     Age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg\n     That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'\n  Reg. Good sir, no more! These are unsightly tricks.\n     Return you to my sister.\n  Lear. [rises] Never, Regan!\n     She hath abated me of half my train;\n     Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue, \n     Most serpent-like, upon the very heart.\n     All the stor'd vengeances of heaven fall\n     On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,\n     You taking airs, with lameness!\n  Corn. Fie, sir, fie!\n  Lear. You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames\n     Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,\n     You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the pow'rful sun,\n     To fall and blast her pride!\n  Reg. O the blest gods! so will you wish on me\n     When the rash mood is on.\n  Lear. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse.\n     Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give\n     Thee o'er to harshness. Her eyes are fierce; but thine\n     Do comfort, and not burn. 'Tis not in thee\n     To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,\n     To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,\n     And, in conclusion, to oppose the bolt\n     Against my coming in. Thou better know'st\n     The offices of nature, bond of childhood, \n     Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude.\n     Thy half o' th' kingdom hast thou not forgot,\n     Wherein I thee endow'd.\n  Reg. Good sir, to th' purpose.\n                                                  Tucket within.\n  Lear. Who put my man i' th' stocks?\n  Corn. What trumpet's that?\n  Reg. I know't- my sister's. This approves her letter,\n     That she would soon be here.\n\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\n\n     Is your lady come?\n  Lear. This is a slave, whose easy-borrowed pride\n     Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.\n     Out, varlet, from my sight!\n  Corn. What means your Grace?\n\n                            Enter Goneril.\n \n  Lear. Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope\n     Thou didst not know on't.- Who comes here? O heavens!\n     If you do love old men, if your sweet sway\n     Allow obedience- if yourselves are old,\n     Make it your cause! Send down, and take my part!\n     [To Goneril] Art not asham'd to look upon this beard?-\n     O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?\n  Gon. Why not by th' hand, sir? How have I offended?\n     All's not offence that indiscretion finds\n     And dotage terms so.\n  Lear. O sides, you are too tough!\n     Will you yet hold? How came my man i' th' stocks?\n  Corn. I set him there, sir; but his own disorders\n     Deserv'd much less advancement.\n  Lear. You? Did you?\n  Reg. I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.\n     If, till the expiration of your month,\n     You will return and sojourn with my sister,\n     Dismissing half your train, come then to me.\n     I am now from home, and out of that provision \n     Which shall be needful for your entertainment.\n  Lear. Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?\n     No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose\n     To wage against the enmity o' th' air,\n     To be a comrade with the wolf and owl-\n     Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?\n     Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took\n     Our youngest born, I could as well be brought\n     To knee his throne, and, squire-like, pension beg\n     To keep base life afoot. Return with her?\n     Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter\n     To this detested groom.                 [Points at Oswald.]\n  Gon. At your choice, sir.\n  Lear. I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad.\n     I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell.\n     We'll no more meet, no more see one another.\n     But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;\n     Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,\n     Which I must needs call mine. Thou art a boil,\n     A plague sore, an embossed carbuncle \n     In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee.\n     Let shame come when it will, I do not call it.\n     I do not bid the Thunder-bearer shoot\n     Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove.\n     Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure;\n     I can be patient, I can stay with Regan,\n     I and my hundred knights.\n  Reg. Not altogether so.\n     I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided\n     For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;\n     For those that mingle reason with your passion\n     Must be content to think you old, and so-\n     But she knows what she does.\n  Lear. Is this well spoken?\n  Reg. I dare avouch it, sir. What, fifty followers?\n     Is it not well? What should you need of more?\n     Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger\n     Speak 'gainst so great a number? How in one house\n     Should many people, under two commands,\n     Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible. \n  Gon. Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance\n     From those that she calls servants, or from mine?\n  Reg. Why not, my lord? If then they chanc'd to slack ye,\n     We could control them. If you will come to me\n     (For now I spy a danger), I entreat you\n     To bring but five-and-twenty. To no more\n     Will I give place or notice.\n  Lear. I gave you all-\n  Reg. And in good time you gave it!\n  Lear. Made you my guardians, my depositaries;\n     But kept a reservation to be followed\n     With such a number. What, must I come to you\n     With five-and-twenty, Regan? Said you so?\n  Reg. And speak't again my lord. No more with me.\n  Lear. Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd\n     When others are more wicked; not being the worst\n     Stands in some rank of praise. [To Goneril] I'll go with\nthee.\n     Thy fifty yet doth double five-and-twenty,\n     And thou art twice her love.\n  Gon. Hear, me, my lord. \n     What need you five-and-twenty, ten, or five,\n     To follow in a house where twice so many\n     Have a command to tend you?\n  Reg. What need one?\n  Lear. O, reason not the need! Our basest beggars\n     Are in the poorest thing superfluous.\n     Allow not nature more than nature needs,\n     Man's life is cheap as beast's. Thou art a lady:\n     If only to go warm were gorgeous,\n     Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st\n     Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need-\n     You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!\n     You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,\n     As full of grief as age; wretched in both.\n     If it be you that stirs these daughters' hearts\n     Against their father, fool me not so much\n     To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,\n     And let not women's weapons, water drops,\n     Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags!\n     I will have such revenges on you both \n     That all the world shall- I will do such things-\n     What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be\n     The terrors of the earth! You think I'll weep.\n     No, I'll not weep.\n     I have full cause of weeping, but this heart\n     Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws\n     Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!\n              Exeunt Lear, Gloucester, Kent, and Fool. Storm and\n                                                        tempest.\n  Corn. Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.\n  Reg. This house is little; the old man and 's people\n     Cannot be well bestow'd.\n  Gon. 'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest\n     And must needs taste his folly.\n  Reg. For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,\n     But not one follower.\n  Gon. So am I purpos'd.\n     Where is my Lord of Gloucester?\n  Corn. Followed the old man forth.\n \n                          Enter Gloucester.\n\n     He is return'd.\n  Glou. The King is in high rage.\n  Corn. Whither is he going?\n  Glou. He calls to horse, but will I know not whither.\n  Corn. 'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.\n  Gon. My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.\n  Glou. Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds\n     Do sorely ruffle. For many miles about\n     There's scarce a bush.\n  Reg. O, sir, to wilful men\n     The injuries that they themselves procure\n     Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors.\n     He is attended with a desperate train,\n     And what they may incense him to, being apt\n     To have his ear abus'd, wisdom bids fear.\n  Corn. Shut up your doors, my lord: 'tis a wild night.\n     My Regan counsels well. Come out o' th' storm.       \n[Exeunt.]\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Enter Kent and a Gentleman at several doors.\n\n  Kent. Who's there, besides foul weather?\n  Gent. One minded like the weather, most unquietly.\n  Kent. I know you. Where's the King?\n  Gent. Contending with the fretful elements;\n     Bids the wind blow the earth into the sea,\n     Or swell the curled waters 'bove the main,\n     That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,\n     Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,\n     Catch in their fury and make nothing of;\n     Strives in his little world of man to outscorn\n     The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.\n     This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,\n     The lion and the belly-pinched wolf\n     Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,\n     And bids what will take all.\n  Kent. But who is with him?\n  Gent. None but the fool, who labours to outjest \n     His heart-struck injuries.\n  Kent. Sir, I do know you,\n     And dare upon the warrant of my note\n     Commend a dear thing to you. There is division\n     (Although as yet the face of it be cover'd\n     With mutual cunning) 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;\n     Who have (as who have not, that their great stars\n     Thron'd and set high?) servants, who seem no less,\n     Which are to France the spies and speculations\n     Intelligent of our state. What hath been seen,\n     Either in snuffs and packings of the Dukes,\n     Or the hard rein which both of them have borne\n     Against the old kind King, or something deeper,\n     Whereof, perchance, these are but furnishings-\n     But, true it is, from France there comes a power\n     Into this scattered kingdom, who already,\n     Wise in our negligence, have secret feet\n     In some of our best ports and are at point\n     To show their open banner. Now to you:\n     If on my credit you dare build so far \n     To make your speed to Dover, you shall find\n     Some that will thank you, making just report\n     Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow\n     The King hath cause to plain.\n     I am a gentleman of blood and breeding,\n     And from some knowledge and assurance offer\n     This office to you.\n  Gent. I will talk further with you.\n  Kent. No, do not.\n     For confirmation that I am much more\n     Than my out-wall, open this purse and take\n     What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia\n     (As fear not but you shall), show her this ring,\n     And she will tell you who your fellow is\n     That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!\n     I will go seek the King.\n  Gent. Give me your hand. Have you no more to say?\n  Kent. Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet:\n     That, when we have found the King (in which your pain\n     That way, I'll this), he that first lights on him \n     Holla the other.\n                                             Exeunt [severally].\n\n\n\n\nScene II.\nAnother part of the heath.\n\nStorm still. Enter Lear and Fool.\n\n  Lear. Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!\n     You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout\n     Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!\n     You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,\n     Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,\n     Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,\n     Strike flat the thick rotundity o' th' world,\n     Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,\n     That makes ingrateful man!\n  Fool. O nuncle, court holy water in a dry house is better than\nthis\n     rain water out o' door. Good nuncle, in, and ask thy\ndaughters\n     blessing! Here's a night pities nether wise men nor fools.\n  Lear. Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!\n     Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.\n     I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.\n     I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,\n     You owe me no subscription. Then let fall \n     Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,\n     A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.\n     But yet I call you servile ministers,\n     That will with two pernicious daughters join\n     Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head\n     So old and white as this! O! O! 'tis foul!\n  Fool. He that has a house to put 's head in has a good\nhead-piece.\n          The codpiece that will house\n            Before the head has any,\n          The head and he shall louse:\n            So beggars marry many.\n          The man that makes his toe\n            What he his heart should make\n          Shall of a corn cry woe,\n            And turn his sleep to wake.\n     For there was never yet fair woman but she made mouths in a\n     glass.\n\n                             Enter Kent.\n \n  Lear. No, I will be the pattern of all patience;\n     I will say nothing.\n  Kent. Who's there?\n  Fool. Marry, here's grace and a codpiece; that's a wise man and\na\n     fool.\n  Kent. Alas, sir, are you here? Things that love night\n     Love not such nights as these. The wrathful skies\n     Gallow the very wanderers of the dark\n     And make them keep their caves. Since I was man,\n     Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,\n     Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never\n     Remember to have heard. Man's nature cannot carry\n     Th' affliction nor the fear.\n  Lear. Let the great gods,\n     That keep this dreadful pudder o'er our heads,\n     Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,\n     That hast within thee undivulged crimes\n     Unwhipp'd of justice. Hide thee, thou bloody hand;\n     Thou perjur'd, and thou simular man of virtue\n     That art incestuous. Caitiff, in pieces shake \n     That under covert and convenient seeming\n     Hast practis'd on man's life. Close pent-up guilts,\n     Rive your concealing continents, and cry\n     These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man\n     More sinn'd against than sinning.\n  Kent. Alack, bareheaded?\n     Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;\n     Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest.\n     Repose you there, whilst I to this hard house\n     (More harder than the stones whereof 'tis rais'd,\n     Which even but now, demanding after you,\n     Denied me to come in) return, and force\n     Their scanted courtesy.\n  Lear. My wits begin to turn.\n     Come on, my boy. How dost, my boy? Art cold?\n     I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?\n     The art of our necessities is strange,\n     That can make vile things precious. Come, your hovel.\n     Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart\n     That's sorry yet for thee. \n  Fool. [sings]\n\n          He that has and a little tiny wit-\n            With hey, ho, the wind and the rain-\n          Must make content with his fortunes fit,\n             For the rain it raineth every day.\n\n  Lear. True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.\n                                         Exeunt [Lear and Kent].\n  Fool. This is a brave night to cool a courtesan. I'll speak a\n     prophecy ere I go:\n          When priests are more in word than matter;\n          When brewers mar their malt with water;\n          When nobles are their tailors' tutors,\n          No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;\n          When every case in law is right,\n          No squire in debt nor no poor knight;\n          When slanders do not live in tongues,\n          Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;\n          When usurers tell their gold i' th' field, \n          And bawds and whores do churches build:\n          Then shall the realm of Albion\n          Come to great confusion.\n          Then comes the time, who lives to see't,\n          That going shall be us'd with feet.\n     This prophecy Merlin shall make, for I live before his time.\nExit.\n\n\n\n\nScene III.\nGloucester's Castle.\n\nEnter Gloucester and Edmund.\n\n  Glou. Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural dealing!\nWhen\n     I desir'd their leave that I might pity him, they took from\nme\n     the use of mine own house, charg'd me on pain of perpetual\n     displeasure neither to speak of him, entreat for him, nor\nany\n     way sustain him.\n  Edm. Most savage and unnatural!\n  Glou. Go to; say you nothing. There is division betwixt the\nDukes,\n     and a worse matter than that. I have received a letter this\n     night- 'tis dangerous to be spoken- I have lock'd the letter\nin\n     my closet. These injuries the King now bears will be\nrevenged\n     home; there's part of a power already footed; we must\nincline to\n     the King. I will seek him and privily relieve him. Go you\nand\n     maintain talk with the Duke, that my charity be not of him\n     perceived. If he ask for me, I am ill and gone to bed.\nThough I\n     die for't, as no less is threat'ned me, the King my old\nmaster\n     must be relieved. There is some strange thing toward,\nEdmund.\n     Pray you be careful.                                  Exit. \n  Edm. This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the Duke\n     Instantly know, and of that letter too.\n     This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me\n     That which my father loses- no less than all.\n     The younger rises when the old doth fall.             Exit.\n\n\n\n\nScene IV.\nThe heath. Before a hovel.\n\nStorm still. Enter Lear, Kent, and Fool.\n\n  Kent. Here is the place, my lord. Good my lord, enter.\n     The tyranny of the open night 's too rough\n     For nature to endure.\n  Lear. Let me alone.\n  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.\n  Lear. Wilt break my heart?\n  Kent. I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.\n  Lear. Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm\n     Invades us to the skin. So 'tis to thee;\n     But where the greater malady is fix'd,\n     The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear;\n     But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,\n     Thou'dst meet the bear i' th' mouth. When the mind's free,\n     The body's delicate. The tempest in my mind\n     Doth from my senses take all feeling else\n     Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!\n     Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand \n     For lifting food to't? But I will punish home!\n     No, I will weep no more. In such a night\n     'To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.\n     In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!\n     Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all!\n     O, that way madness lies; let me shun that!\n     No more of that.\n  Kent. Good my lord, enter here.\n  Lear. Prithee go in thyself; seek thine own ease.\n     This tempest will not give me leave to ponder\n     On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.\n     [To the Fool] In, boy; go first.- You houseless poverty-\n     Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.\n                                                    Exit [Fool].\n     Poor naked wretches, wheresoe'er you are,\n     That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,\n     How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,\n     Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you\n     From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en\n     Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp; \n     Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,\n     That thou mayst shake the superflux to them\n     And show the heavens more just.\n  Edg. [within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!\n\n                     Enter Fool [from the hovel].\n\n  Fool. Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit. Help me, help\nme!\n  Kent. Give me thy hand. Who's there?\n  Fool. A spirit, a spirit! He says his name's poor Tom.\n  Kent. What art thou that dost grumble there i' th' straw?\n     Come forth.\n\n                 Enter Edgar [disguised as a madman].\n\n  Edg. Away! the foul fiend follows me! Through the sharp\nhawthorn\n     blows the cold wind. Humh! go to thy cold bed, and warm\nthee.\n  Lear. Hast thou given all to thy two daughters, and art thou\ncome\n     to this?\n  Edg. Who gives anything to poor Tom? whom the foul fiend hath\nled \n     through fire and through flame, through ford and whirlpool,\no'er\n     bog and quagmire; that hath laid knives under his pillow and\n     halters in his pew, set ratsbane by his porridge, made him\nproud\n     of heart, to ride on a bay trotting horse over four-inch'd\n     bridges, to course his own shadow for a traitor. Bless thy\nfive\n     wits! Tom 's acold. O, do de, do de, do de. Bless thee from\n     whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some\ncharity,\n     whom the foul fiend vexes. There could I have him now- and\nthere-\n     and there again- and there!\n                                                    Storm still.\n  Lear. What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?\n     Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give 'em all?\n  Fool. Nay, he reserv'd a blanket, else we had been all sham'd.\n  Lear. Now all the plagues that in the pendulous air\n     Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!\n  Kent. He hath no daughters, sir.\n  Lear. Death, traitor! nothing could have subdu'd nature\n     To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.\n     Is it the fashion that discarded fathers\n     Should have thus little mercy on their flesh? \n     Judicious punishment! 'Twas this flesh begot\n     Those pelican daughters.\n  Edg. Pillicock sat on Pillicock's Hill. 'Allow, 'allow, loo,\nloo!\n  Fool. This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.\n  Edg. Take heed o' th' foul fiend; obey thy parents: keep thy\nword\n     justly; swear not; commit not with man's sworn spouse; set\nnot\n     thy sweet heart on proud array. Tom 's acold.\n  Lear. What hast thou been?\n  Edg. A servingman, proud in heart and mind; that curl'd my\nhair,\n     wore gloves in my cap; serv'd the lust of my mistress' heart\nand\n     did the act of darkness with her; swore as many oaths as I\nspake\n     words, and broke them in the sweet face of heaven; one that\n     slept in the contriving of lust, and wak'd to do it. Wine\nlov'd\n     I deeply, dice dearly; and in woman out-paramour'd the Turk.\n     False of heart, light of ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth,\nfox\n     in stealth, wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in\nprey.\n     Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of silks\nbetray\n     thy poor heart to woman. Keep thy foot out of brothel, thy\nhand\n     out of placket, thy pen from lender's book, and defy the\nfoul\n     fiend. Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind; says \n     suum, mun, hey, no, nonny. Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa!\nlet\n     him trot by.\n                                                    Storm still.\n  Lear. Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer with\nthy\n     uncover'd body this extremity of the skies. Is man no more\nthan\n     this? Consider him well. Thou ow'st the worm no silk, the\nbeast\n     no hide, the sheep no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! Here's\nthree\n     on's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself;\n     unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor, bare, forked\n     animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings! Come, unbutton\n     here.\n                                         [Tears at his clothes.]\n  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, be contented! 'Tis a naughty night to\nswim\n     in. Now a little fire in a wild field were like an old\nlecher's\n     heart- a small spark, all the rest on's body cold. Look,\nhere\n     comes a walking fire.\n\n                    Enter Gloucester with a torch.\n\n  Edg. This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet. He begins at\ncurfew, \n     and walks till the first cock. He gives the web and the pin,\n     squints the eye, and makes the harelip; mildews the white\nwheat,\n     and hurts the poor creature of earth.\n\n           Saint Withold footed thrice the 'old;\n           He met the nightmare, and her nine fold;\n              Bid her alight\n              And her troth plight,\n           And aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!\n\n  Kent. How fares your Grace?\n  Lear. What's he?\n  Kent. Who's there? What is't you seek?\n  Glou. What are you there? Your names?\n  Edg. Poor Tom, that eats the swimming frog, the toad, the\ntodpole,\n     the wall-newt and the water; that in the fury of his heart,\nwhen\n     the foul fiend rages, eats cow-dung for sallets, swallows\nthe\n     old rat and the ditch-dog, drinks the green mantle of the\n     standing pool; who is whipp'd from tithing to tithing, and\n     stock-punish'd and imprison'd; who hath had three suits to\nhis \n     back, six shirts to his body, horse to ride, and weapons to\n     wear;\n\n          But mice and rats, and such small deer,\n          Have been Tom's food for seven long year.\n\n     Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin! peace, thou fiend!\n  Glou. What, hath your Grace no better company?\n  Edg. The prince of darkness is a gentleman!\n     Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.\n  Glou. Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,\n     That it doth hate what gets it.\n  Edg. Poor Tom 's acold.\n  Glou. Go in with me. My duty cannot suffer\n     T' obey in all your daughters' hard commands.\n     Though their injunction be to bar my doors\n     And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,\n     Yet have I ventur'd to come seek you out\n     And bring you where both fire and food is ready.\n  Lear. First let me talk with this philosopher. \n     What is the cause of thunder?\n  Kent. Good my lord, take his offer; go into th' house.\n  Lear. I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.\n     What is your study?\n  Edg. How to prevent the fiend and to kill vermin.\n  Lear. Let me ask you one word in private.\n  Kent. Importune him once more to go, my lord.\n     His wits begin t' unsettle.\n  Glou. Canst thou blame him?\n                                                    Storm still.\n     His daughters seek his death. Ah, that good Kent!\n     He said it would be thus- poor banish'd man!\n     Thou say'st the King grows mad: I'll tell thee, friend,\n     I am almost mad myself. I had a son,\n     Now outlaw'd from my blood. He sought my life\n     But lately, very late. I lov'd him, friend-\n     No father his son dearer. True to tell thee,\n     The grief hath craz'd my wits. What a night 's this!\n     I do beseech your Grace-\n  Lear. O, cry you mercy, sir. \n     Noble philosopher, your company.\n  Edg. Tom's acold.\n  Glou. In, fellow, there, into th' hovel; keep thee warm.\n  Lear. Come, let's in all.\n  Kent. This way, my lord.\n  Lear. With him!\n     I will keep still with my philosopher.\n  Kent. Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.\n  Glou. Take him you on.\n  Kent. Sirrah, come on; go along with us.\n  Lear. Come, good Athenian.\n  Glou. No words, no words! hush.\n  Edg. Child Rowland to the dark tower came;\n     His word was still\n\n          Fie, foh, and fum!\n          I smell the blood of a British man.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\nScene V.\nGloucester's Castle.\n\nEnter Cornwall and Edmund.\n\n  Corn. I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.\n  Edm. How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus gives\nway to\n     loyalty, something fears me to think of.\n  Corn. I now perceive it was not altogether your brother's evil\n     disposition made him seek his death; but a provoking merit,\nset\n     awork by a reproveable badness in himself.\n  Edm. How malicious is my fortune that I must repent to be just!\n     This is the letter he spoke of, which approves him an\n     intelligent party to the advantages of France. O heavens!\nthat\n     this treason were not- or not I the detector!\n  Corn. Go with me to the Duchess.\n  Edm. If the matter of this paper be certain, you have mighty\n     business in hand.\n  Corn. True or false, it hath made thee Earl of Gloucester.\n     Seek out where thy father is, that he may be ready for our\n     apprehension.\n  Edm. [aside] If I find him comforting the King, it will stuff\nhis \n     suspicion more fully.- I will persever in my course of\nloyalty,\n     though the conflict be sore between that and my blood.\n  Corn. I will lay trust upon thee, and thou shalt find a dearer\n     father in my love.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene VI.\nA farmhouse near Gloucester's Castle.\n\nEnter Gloucester, Lear, Kent, Fool, and Edgar.\n\n  Glou. Here is better than the open air; take it thankfully. I\nwill\n     piece out the comfort with what addition I can. I will not\nbe\n     long from you.\n  Kent. All the power of his wits have given way to his\nimpatience.\n     The gods reward your kindness!\n                                              Exit [Gloucester].\n  Edg. Frateretto calls me, and tells me Nero is an angler in the\n     lake of darkness. Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.\n  Fool. Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a gentleman\nor a\n     yeoman.\n  Lear. A king, a king!\n  Fool. No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son; for\nhe's a\n     mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman before him.\n  Lear. To have a thousand with red burning spits\n     Come hizzing in upon 'em-\n  Edg. The foul fiend bites my back.\n  Fool. He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a horse's\n     health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath. \n  Lear. It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.\n     [To Edgar] Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer.\n     [To the Fool] Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you\nshe-foxes!\n  Edg. Look, where he stands and glares! Want'st thou eyes at\ntrial,\n     madam?\n\n             Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me.\n\n  Fool.      Her boat hath a leak,\n             And she must not speak\n           Why she dares not come over to thee.\n\n  Edg. The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a\nnightingale.\n     Hoppedance cries in Tom's belly for two white herring. Croak\n     not, black angel; I have no food for thee.\n  Kent. How do you, sir? Stand you not so amaz'd.\n     Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?\n  Lear. I'll see their trial first. Bring in their evidence.\n     [To Edgar] Thou, robed man of justice, take thy place.\n     [To the Fool] And thou, his yokefellow of equity, \n     Bench by his side. [To Kent] You are o' th' commission,\n     Sit you too.\n  Edg. Let us deal justly.\n\n          Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?\n            Thy sheep be in the corn;\n          And for one blast of thy minikin mouth\n            Thy sheep shall take no harm.\n\n     Purr! the cat is gray.\n  Lear. Arraign her first. 'Tis Goneril. I here take my oath\nbefore\n     this honourable assembly, she kicked the poor King her\nfather.\n  Fool. Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?\n  Lear. She cannot deny it.\n  Fool. Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.\n  Lear. And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim\n     What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!\n     Arms, arms! sword! fire! Corruption in the place!\n     False justicer, why hast thou let her scape?\n  Edg. Bless thy five wits! \n  Kent. O pity! Sir, where is the patience now\n     That you so oft have boasted to retain?\n  Edg. [aside] My tears begin to take his part so much\n     They'll mar my counterfeiting.\n  Lear. The little dogs and all,\n     Tray, Blanch, and Sweetheart, see, they bark at me.\n  Edg. Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!\n           Be thy mouth or black or white,\n           Tooth that poisons if it bite;\n           Mastiff, greyhound, mongrel grim,\n           Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,\n           Bobtail tyke or trundle-tall-\n           Tom will make them weep and wail;\n           For, with throwing thus my head,\n           Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.\n     Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and fairs and\nmarket\n     towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.\n  Lear. Then let them anatomize Regan. See what breeds about her\n     heart. Is there any cause in nature that makes these hard\n     hearts? [To Edgar] You, sir- I entertain you for one of my \n     hundred; only I do not like the fashion of your garments.\nYou'll\n     say they are Persian attire; but let them be chang'd.\n  Kent. Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.\n  Lear. Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains.\n     So, so, so. We'll go to supper i' th' morning. So, so, so.\n  Fool. And I'll go to bed at noon.\n\n                          Enter Gloucester.\n\n  Glou. Come hither, friend. Where is the King my master?\n  Kent. Here, sir; but trouble him not; his wits are gone.\n  Glou. Good friend, I prithee take him in thy arms.\n     I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him.\n     There is a litter ready; lay him in't\n     And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet\n     Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master.\n     If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,\n     With thine, and all that offer to defend him,\n     Stand in assured loss. Take up, take up!\n     And follow me, that will to some provision \n     Give thee quick conduct.\n  Kent. Oppressed nature sleeps.\n     This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,\n     Which, if convenience will not allow,\n     Stand in hard cure. [To the Fool] Come, help to bear thy\nmaster.\n     Thou must not stay behind.\n  Glou. Come, come, away!\n                                         Exeunt [all but Edgar].\n  Edg. When we our betters see bearing our woes,\n     We scarcely think our miseries our foes.\n     Who alone suffers suffers most i' th' mind,\n     Leaving free things and happy shows behind;\n     But then the mind much sufferance doth o'erskip\n     When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.\n     How light and portable my pain seems now,\n     When that which makes me bend makes the King bow,\n     He childed as I fathered! Tom, away!\n     Mark the high noises, and thyself bewray\n     When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,\n     In thy just proof repeals and reconciles thee. \n     What will hap more to-night, safe scape the King!\n     Lurk, lurk.

By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done\n     To pluck me by the beard.\n  Reg. So white, and such a traitor!\n  Glou. Naughty lady,\n     These hairs which thou dost ravish from my chin\n     Will quicken, and accuse thee. I am your host.\n     With robber's hands my hospitable favours\n     You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?\n  Corn. Come, sir, what letters had you late from France? \n  Reg. Be simple-answer'd, for we know the truth.\n  Corn. And what confederacy have you with the traitors\n     Late footed in the kingdom?\n  Reg. To whose hands have you sent the lunatic King?\n     Speak.\n  Glou. I have a letter guessingly set down,\n     Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,\n     And not from one oppos'd.\n  Corn. Cunning.\n  Reg. And false.\n  Corn. Where hast thou sent the King?\n  Glou. To Dover.\n  Reg. Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charg'd at peril-\n  Corn. Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.\n  Glou. I am tied to th' stake, and I must stand the course.\n  Reg. Wherefore to Dover, sir?\n  Glou. Because I would not see thy cruel nails\n     Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister\n     In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.\n     The sea, with such a storm as his bare head \n     In hell-black night endur'd, would have buoy'd up\n     And quench'd the steeled fires.\n     Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.\n     If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,\n     Thou shouldst have said, 'Good porter, turn the key.'\n     All cruels else subscrib'd. But I shall see\n     The winged vengeance overtake such children.\n  Corn. See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.\n     Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.\n  Glou. He that will think to live till he be old,\n     Give me some help!- O cruel! O ye gods!\n  Reg. One side will mock another. Th' other too!\n  Corn. If you see vengeance-\n  1. Serv. Hold your hand, my lord!\n     I have serv'd you ever since I was a child;\n     But better service have I never done you\n     Than now to bid you hold.\n  Reg. How now, you dog?\n  1. Serv. If you did wear a beard upon your chin,\n     I'ld shake it on this quarrel. \n  Reg. What do you mean?\n  Corn. My villain!                               Draw and fight.\n  1. Serv. Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.\n  Reg. Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus?\n                        She takes a sword and runs at him behind.\n  1. Serv. O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left\n     To see some mischief on him. O!                     He dies.\n  Corn. Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!\n     Where is thy lustre now?\n  Glou. All dark and comfortless! Where's my son Edmund?\n     Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature\n     To quit this horrid act.\n  Reg. Out, treacherous villain!\n     Thou call'st on him that hates thee. It was he\n     That made the overture of thy treasons to us;\n     Who is too good to pity thee.\n  Glou. O my follies! Then Edgar was abus'd.\n     Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!\n  Reg. Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell\n     His way to Dover. \n                                     Exit [one] with Gloucester.\n     How is't, my lord? How look you?\n  Corn. I have receiv'd a hurt. Follow me, lady.\n     Turn out that eyeless villain. Throw this slave\n     Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace.\n     Untimely comes this hurt. Give me your arm.\n                                  Exit [Cornwall, led by Regan].\n  2. Serv. I'll never care what wickedness I do,\n     If this man come to good.\n  3. Serv. If she live long,\n     And in the end meet the old course of death,\n     Women will all turn monsters.\n  2. Serv. Let's follow the old Earl, and get the bedlam\n     To lead him where he would. His roguish madness\n     Allows itself to anything.\n  3. Serv. Go thou. I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs\n     To apply to his bleeding face. Now heaven help him!\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,\n     Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,\n     The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,\n     Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear.\n     The lamentable change is from the best;\n     The worst returns to laughter. Welcome then,\n     Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!\n     The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst\n     Owes nothing to thy blasts.\n\n                 Enter Gloucester, led by an Old Man.\n\n     But who comes here?\n     My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!\n     But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,\n     Life would not yield to age.\n  Old Man. O my good lord, \n     I have been your tenant, and your father's tenant,\n     These fourscore years.\n  Glou. Away, get thee away! Good friend, be gone.\n     Thy comforts can do me no good at all;\n     Thee they may hurt.\n  Old Man. You cannot see your way.\n  Glou. I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;\n     I stumbled when I saw. Full oft 'tis seen\n     Our means secure us, and our mere defects\n     Prove our commodities. Ah dear son Edgar,\n     The food of thy abused father's wrath!\n     Might I but live to see thee in my touch,\n     I'ld say I had eyes again!\n  Old Man. How now? Who's there?\n  Edg. [aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at the worst'?\n     I am worse than e'er I was.\n  Old Man. 'Tis poor mad Tom.\n  Edg. [aside] And worse I may be yet. The worst is not\n     So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'\n  Old Man. Fellow, where goest? \n  Glou. Is it a beggarman?\n  Old Man. Madman and beggar too.\n  Glou. He has some reason, else he could not beg.\n     I' th' last night's storm I such a fellow saw,\n     Which made me think a man a worm. My son\n     Came then into my mind, and yet my mind\n     Was then scarce friends with him. I have heard more since.\n     As flies to wanton boys are we to th' gods.\n     They kill us for their sport.\n  Edg. [aside] How should this be?\n     Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,\n     Ang'ring itself and others.- Bless thee, master!\n  Glou. Is that the naked fellow?\n  Old Man. Ay, my lord.\n  Glou. Then prithee get thee gone. If for my sake\n     Thou wilt o'ertake us hence a mile or twain\n     I' th' way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;\n     And bring some covering for this naked soul,\n     Who I'll entreat to lead me.\n  Old Man. Alack, sir, he is mad! \n  Glou. 'Tis the time's plague when madmen lead the blind.\n     Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure.\n     Above the rest, be gone.\n  Old Man. I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,\n     Come on't what will.                                  Exit.\n  Glou. Sirrah naked fellow-\n  Edg. Poor Tom's acold. [Aside] I cannot daub it further.\n  Glou. Come hither, fellow.\n  Edg. [aside] And yet I must.- Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.\n  Glou. Know'st thou the way to Dover?\n  Edg. Both stile and gate, horseway and footpath. Poor Tom hath\nbeen\n     scar'd out of his good wits. Bless thee, good man's son,\nfrom\n     the foul fiend! Five fiends have been in poor Tom at once:\nof\n     lust, as Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu,\nof\n     stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of mopping and\n     mowing, who since possesses chambermaids and waiting women.\nSo,\n     bless thee, master!\n  Glou. Here, take this Purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues\n     Have humbled to all strokes. That I am wretched\n     Makes thee the happier. Heavens, deal so still! \n     Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,\n     That slaves your ordinance, that will not see\n     Because he does not feel, feel your pow'r quickly;\n     So distribution should undo excess,\n     And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?\n  Edg. Ay, master.\n  Glou. There is a cliff, whose high and bending head\n     Looks fearfully in the confined deep.\n     Bring me but to the very brim of it,\n     And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear\n     With something rich about me. From that place\n     I shall no leading need.\n  Edg. Give me thy arm.\n     Poor Tom shall lead thee.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene II.\nBefore the Duke of Albany's Palace.\n\nEnter Goneril and [Edmund the] Bastard.\n\n  Gon. Welcome, my lord. I marvel our mild husband\n     Not met us on the way.\n\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\n\n     Now, where's your master?\n  Osw. Madam, within, but never man so chang'd.\n     I told him of the army that was landed:\n     He smil'd at it. I told him you were coming:\n     His answer was, 'The worse.' Of Gloucester's treachery\n     And of the loyal service of his son\n     When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot\n     And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out.\n     What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;\n     What like, offensive.\n  Gon. [to Edmund] Then shall you go no further.\n     It is the cowish terror of his spirit, \n     That dares not undertake. He'll not feel wrongs\n     Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way\n     May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother.\n     Hasten his musters and conduct his pow'rs.\n     I must change arms at home and give the distaff\n     Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant\n     Shall pass between us. Ere long you are like to hear\n     (If you dare venture in your own behalf)\n     A mistress's command. Wear this.          [Gives a favour.]\n     Spare speech.\n     Decline your head. This kiss, if it durst speak,\n     Would stretch thy spirits up into the air.\n     Conceive, and fare thee well.\n  Edm. Yours in the ranks of death!                        Exit.\n  Gon. My most dear Gloucester!\n     O, the difference of man and man!\n     To thee a woman's services are due;\n     My fool usurps my body.\n  Osw. Madam, here comes my lord.                          Exit.\n \n                            Enter Albany.\n\n  Gon. I have been worth the whistle.\n  Alb. O Goneril,\n     You are not worth the dust which the rude wind\n     Blows in your face! I fear your disposition.\n     That nature which contemns it origin\n     Cannot be bordered certain in itself.\n     She that herself will sliver and disbranch\n     From her material sap, perforce must wither\n     And come to deadly use.\n  Gon. No more! The text is foolish.\n  Alb. Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile;\n     Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?\n     Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?\n     A father, and a gracious aged man,\n     Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,\n     Most barbarous, most degenerate, have you madded.\n     Could my good brother suffer you to do it?\n     A man, a prince, by him so benefited! \n     If that the heavens do not their visible spirits\n     Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,\n     It will come,\n     Humanity must perforce prey on itself,\n     Like monsters of the deep.\n  Gon. Milk-liver'd man!\n     That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;\n     Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning\n     Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st\n     Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd\n     Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?\n     France spreads his banners in our noiseless land,\n     With plumed helm thy state begins to threat,\n     Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest\n     'Alack, why does he so?'\n  Alb. See thyself, devil!\n     Proper deformity seems not in the fiend\n     So horrid as in woman.\n  Gon. O vain fool!\n  Alb. Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame! \n     Bemonster not thy feature! Were't my fitness\n     To let these hands obey my blood,\n     They are apt enough to dislocate and tear\n     Thy flesh and bones. Howe'er thou art a fiend,\n     A woman's shape doth shield thee.\n  Gon. Marry, your manhood mew!\n\n                          Enter a Gentleman.\n\n  Alb. What news?\n  Gent. O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall 's dead,\n     Slain by his servant, going to put out\n     The other eye of Gloucester.\n  Alb. Gloucester's eyes?\n  Gent. A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,\n     Oppos'd against the act, bending his sword\n     To his great master; who, thereat enrag'd,\n     Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;\n     But not without that harmful stroke which since\n     Hath pluck'd him after. \n  Alb. This shows you are above,\n     You justicers, that these our nether crimes\n     So speedily can venge! But O poor Gloucester!\n     Lose he his other eye?\n  Gent. Both, both, my lord.\n     This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer.\n     'Tis from your sister.\n  Gon. [aside] One way I like this well;\n     But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,\n     May all the building in my fancy pluck\n     Upon my hateful life. Another way\n     The news is not so tart.- I'll read, and answer.\nExit.\n  Alb. Where was his son when they did take his eyes?\n  Gent. Come with my lady hither.\n  Alb. He is not here.\n  Gent. No, my good lord; I met him back again.\n  Alb. Knows he the wickedness?\n  Gent. Ay, my good lord. 'Twas he inform'd against him,\n     And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment \n     Might have the freer course.\n  Alb. Gloucester, I live\n     To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the King,\n     And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend.\n     Tell me what more thou know'st.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene III.\nThe French camp near Dover.\n\nEnter Kent and a Gentleman.\n\n  Kent. Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back know you\nthe\n     reason?\n  Gent. Something he left imperfect in the state, which since his\n     coming forth is thought of, which imports to the kingdom so\nmuch\n     fear and danger that his personal return was most required\nand\n     necessary.\n  Kent. Who hath he left behind him general?\n  Gent. The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.\n  Kent. Did your letters pierce the Queen to any demonstration of\n     grief?\n  Gent. Ay, sir. She took them, read them in my presence,\n     And now and then an ample tear trill'd down\n     Her delicate cheek. It seem'd she was a queen\n     Over her passion, who, most rebel-like,\n     Sought to be king o'er her.\n  Kent. O, then it mov'd her?\n  Gent. Not to a rage. Patience and sorrow strove \n     Who should express her goodliest. You have seen\n     Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears\n     Were like, a better way. Those happy smilets\n     That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know\n     What guests were in her eyes, which parted thence\n     As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,\n     Sorrow would be a rarity most belov'd,\n     If all could so become it.\n  Kent. Made she no verbal question?\n  Gent. Faith, once or twice she heav'd the name of father\n     Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart;\n     Cried 'Sisters, sisters! Shame of ladies! Sisters!\n     Kent! father! sisters! What, i' th' storm? i' th' night?\n     Let pity not be believ'd!' There she shook\n     The holy water from her heavenly eyes,\n     And clamour moisten'd. Then away she started\n     To deal with grief alone.\n  Kent. It is the stars,\n     The stars above us, govern our conditions;\n     Else one self mate and mate could not beget \n     Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?\n  Gent. No.\n  Kent. Was this before the King return'd?\n  Gent. No, since.\n  Kent. Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' th' town;\n     Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers\n     What we are come about, and by no means\n     Will yield to see his daughter.\n  Gent. Why, good sir?\n  Kent. A sovereign shame so elbows him; his own unkindness,\n     That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her\n     To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights\n     To his dog-hearted daughters- these things sting\n     His mind so venomously that burning shame\n     Detains him from Cordelia.\n  Gent. Alack, poor gentleman!\n  Kent. Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?\n  Gent. 'Tis so; they are afoot.\n  Kent. Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear\n     And leave you to attend him. Some dear cause \n     Will in concealment wrap me up awhile.\n     When I am known aright, you shall not grieve\n     Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you go\n     Along with me.                                      Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene IV.\nThe French camp.\n\nEnter, with Drum and Colours, Cordelia, Doctor, and Soldiers.\n\n  Cor. Alack, 'tis he! Why, he was met even now\n     As mad as the vex'd sea, singing aloud,\n     Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow weeds,\n     With hardocks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo flow'rs,\n     Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow\n     In our sustaining corn. A century send forth.\n     Search every acre in the high-grown field\n     And bring him to our eye. [Exit an Officer.] What can man's\n        wisdom\n     In the restoring his bereaved sense?\n     He that helps him take all my outward worth.\n  Doct. There is means, madam.\n     Our foster nurse of nature is repose,\n     The which he lacks. That to provoke in him\n     Are many simples operative, whose power\n     Will close the eye of anguish.\n  Cor. All blest secrets, \n     All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,\n     Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate\n     In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him!\n     Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life\n     That wants the means to lead it.\n\n                           Enter Messenger.\n\n  Mess. News, madam.\n     The British pow'rs are marching hitherward.\n  Cor. 'Tis known before. Our preparation stands\n     In expectation of them. O dear father,\n     It is thy business that I go about.\n     Therefore great France\n     My mourning and important tears hath pitied.\n     No blown ambition doth our arms incite,\n     But love, dear love, and our ag'd father's right.\n     Soon may I hear and see him!\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene V.\nGloucester's Castle.\n\nEnter Regan and [Oswald the] Steward.\n\n  Reg. But are my brother's pow'rs set forth?\n  Osw. Ay, madam.\n  Reg. Himself in person there?\n  Osw. Madam, with much ado.\n     Your sister is the better soldier.\n  Reg. Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?\n  Osw. No, madam.\n  Reg. What might import my sister's letter to him?\n  Osw. I know not, lady.\n  Reg. Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.\n     It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,\n     To let him live. Where he arrives he moves\n     All hearts against us. Edmund, I think, is gone,\n     In pity of his misery, to dispatch\n     His nighted life; moreover, to descry\n     The strength o' th' enemy.\n  Osw. I must needs after him, madam, with my letter. \n  Reg. Our troops set forth to-morrow. Stay with us.\n     The ways are dangerous.\n  Osw. I may not, madam.\n     My lady charg'd my duty in this business.\n  Reg. Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you\n     Transport her purposes by word? Belike,\n     Something- I know not what- I'll love thee much-\n     Let me unseal the letter.\n  Osw. Madam, I had rather-\n  Reg. I know your lady does not love her husband;\n     I am sure of that; and at her late being here\n     She gave strange eliads and most speaking looks\n     To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.\n  Osw. I, madam?\n  Reg. I speak in understanding. Y'are! I know't.\n     Therefore I do advise you take this note.\n     My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd,\n     And more convenient is he for my hand\n     Than for your lady's. You may gather more.\n     If you do find him, pray you give him this; \n     And when your mistress hears thus much from you,\n     I pray desire her call her wisdom to her.\n     So farewell.\n     If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,\n     Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.\n  Osw. Would I could meet him, madam! I should show\n     What party I do follow.\n  Reg. Fare thee well.                                   Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene VI.\nThe country near Dover.\n\nEnter Gloucester, and Edgar [like a Peasant].\n\n  Glou. When shall I come to th' top of that same hill?\n  Edg. You do climb up it now. Look how we labour.\n  Glou. Methinks the ground is even.\n  Edg. Horrible steep.\n     Hark, do you hear the sea?\n  Glou. No, truly.\n  Edg. Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect\n     By your eyes' anguish.\n  Glou. So may it be indeed.\n     Methinks thy voice is alter'd, and thou speak'st\n     In better phrase and matter than thou didst.\n  Edg. Y'are much deceiv'd. In nothing am I chang'd\n     But in my garments.\n  Glou. Methinks y'are better spoken.\n  Edg. Come on, sir; here's the place. Stand still. How fearful\n     And dizzy 'tis to cast one's eyes so low!\n     The crows and choughs that wing the midway air \n     Show scarce so gross as beetles. Halfway down\n     Hangs one that gathers sampire- dreadful trade!\n     Methinks he seems no bigger than his head.\n     The fishermen that walk upon the beach\n     Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,\n     Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy\n     Almost too small for sight. The murmuring surge\n     That on th' unnumb'red idle pebble chafes\n     Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more,\n     Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight\n     Topple down headlong.\n  Glou. Set me where you stand.\n  Edg. Give me your hand. You are now within a foot\n     Of th' extreme verge. For all beneath the moon\n     Would I not leap upright.\n  Glou. Let go my hand.\n     Here, friend, is another purse; in it a jewel\n     Well worth a poor man's taking. Fairies and gods\n     Prosper it with thee! Go thou further off;\n     Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going. \n  Edg. Now fare ye well, good sir.\n  Glou. With all my heart.\n  Edg. [aside]. Why I do trifle thus with his despair\n     Is done to cure it.\n  Glou. O you mighty gods!                            He kneels.\n     This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,\n     Shake patiently my great affliction off.\n     If I could bear it longer and not fall\n     To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,\n     My snuff and loathed part of nature should\n     Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!\n     Now, fellow, fare thee well.\n                                  He falls [forward and swoons].\n  Edg. Gone, sir, farewell.-\n     And yet I know not how conceit may rob\n     The treasury of life when life itself\n     Yields to the theft. Had he been where he thought,\n     By this had thought been past.- Alive or dead?\n     Ho you, sir! friend! Hear you, sir? Speak!-\n     Thus might he pass indeed. Yet he revives. \n     What are you, sir?\n  Glou. Away, and let me die.\n  Edg. Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,\n     So many fadom down precipitating,\n     Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg; but thou dost breathe;\n     Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.\n     Ten masts at each make not the altitude\n     Which thou hast perpendicularly fell.\n     Thy life is a miracle. Speak yet again.\n  Glou. But have I fall'n, or no?\n  Edg. From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.\n     Look up a-height. The shrill-gorg'd lark so far\n     Cannot be seen or heard. Do but look up.\n  Glou. Alack, I have no eyes!\n     Is wretchedness depriv'd that benefit\n     To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort\n     When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage\n     And frustrate his proud will.\n  Edg. Give me your arm.\n     Up- so. How is't? Feel you your legs? You stand. \n  Glou. Too well, too well.\n  Edg. This is above all strangeness.\n     Upon the crown o' th' cliff what thing was that\n     Which parted from you?\n  Glou. A poor unfortunate beggar.\n  Edg. As I stood here below, methought his eyes\n     Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,\n     Horns whelk'd and wav'd like the enridged sea.\n     It was some fiend. Therefore, thou happy father,\n     Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours\n     Of men's impossibility, have preserv'd thee.\n  Glou. I do remember now. Henceforth I'll bear\n     Affliction till it do cry out itself\n     'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,\n     I took it for a man. Often 'twould say\n     'The fiend, the fiend'- he led me to that place.\n  Edg. Bear free and patient thoughts.\n\n         Enter Lear, mad, [fantastically dressed with weeds].\n \n     But who comes here?\n     The safer sense will ne'er accommodate\n     His master thus.\n  Lear. No, they cannot touch me for coming;\n     I am the King himself.\n  Edg. O thou side-piercing sight!\n  Lear. Nature 's above art in that respect. There's your press\n     money. That fellow handles his bow like a crow-keeper. Draw\nme\n     a clothier's yard. Look, look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this\npiece\n     of toasted cheese will do't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove\nit\n     on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well flown, bird!\ni'\n     th' clout, i' th' clout! Hewgh! Give the word.\n  Edg. Sweet marjoram.\n  Lear. Pass.\n  Glou. I know that voice.\n  Lear. Ha! Goneril with a white beard? They flatter'd me like a\ndog,\n     and told me I had white hairs in my beard ere the black ones\n     were there. To say 'ay' and 'no' to everything I said! 'Ay'\nand\n     'no' too was no good divinity. When the rain came to wet me\n     once, and the wind to make me chatter; when the thunder\nwould \n     not peace at my bidding; there I found 'em, there I smelt\n'em\n     out. Go to, they are not men o' their words! They told me I\nwas\n     everything. 'Tis a lie- I am not ague-proof.\n  Glou. The trick of that voice I do well remember.\n     Is't not the King?\n  Lear. Ay, every inch a king!\n     When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.\n     I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause?\n     Adultery?\n     Thou shalt not die. Die for adultery? No.\n     The wren goes to't, and the small gilded fly\n     Does lecher in my sight.\n     Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son\n     Was kinder to his father than my daughters\n     Got 'tween the lawful sheets.\n     To't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.\n     Behold yond simp'ring dame,\n     Whose face between her forks presageth snow,\n     That minces virtue, and does shake the head\n     To hear of pleasure's name. \n     The fitchew nor the soiled horse goes to't\n     With a more riotous appetite.\n     Down from the waist they are Centaurs,\n     Though women all above.\n     But to the girdle do the gods inherit,\n     Beneath is all the fiend's.\n     There's hell, there's darkness, there's the sulphurous pit;\n     burning, scalding, stench, consumption. Fie, fie, fie! pah,\npah!\n     Give me an ounce of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my\n     imagination. There's money for thee.\n  Glou. O, let me kiss that hand!\n  Lear. Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.\n  Glou. O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world\n     Shall so wear out to naught. Dost thou know me?\n  Lear. I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny at\nme?\n     No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not love. Read thou this\n     challenge; mark but the penning of it.\n  Glou. Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.\n  Edg. [aside] I would not take this from report. It is,\n     And my heart breaks at it. \n  Lear. Read.\n  Glou. What, with the case of eyes?\n  Lear. O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your head, nor\nno\n     money in your purse? Your eyes are in a heavy case, your\npurse\n     in a light. Yet you see how this world goes.\n  Glou. I see it feelingly.\n  Lear. What, art mad? A man may see how the world goes with no\neyes.\n     Look with thine ears. See how yond justice rails upon yond\n     simple thief. Hark in thine ear. Change places and,\nhandy-dandy,\n     which is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen a\n     farmer's dog bark at a beggar?\n  Glou. Ay, sir.\n  Lear. And the creature run from the cur? There thou mightst\nbehold\n     the great image of authority: a dog's obeyed in office.\n     Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!\n     Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back.\n     Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind\n     For which thou whip'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.\n     Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;\n     Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, \n     And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks;\n     Arm it in rags, a pygmy's straw does pierce it.\n     None does offend, none- I say none! I'll able 'em.\n     Take that of me, my friend, who have the power\n     To seal th' accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes\n     And, like a scurvy politician, seem\n     To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now!\n     Pull off my boots. Harder, harder! So.\n  Edg. O, matter and impertinency mix'd!\n     Reason, in madness!\n  Lear. If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.\n     I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester.\n     Thou must be patient. We came crying hither;\n     Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air\n     We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee. Mark.\n  Glou. Alack, alack the day!\n  Lear. When we are born, we cry that we are come\n     To this great stage of fools. This' a good block.\n     It were a delicate stratagem to shoe\n     A troop of horse with felt. I'll put't in proof, \n     And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,\n     Then kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!\n\n                 Enter a Gentleman [with Attendants].\n\n  Gent. O, here he is! Lay hand upon him.- Sir,\n     Your most dear daughter-\n  Lear. No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even\n     The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;\n     You shall have ransom. Let me have a surgeon;\n     I am cut to th' brains.\n  Gent. You shall have anything.\n  Lear. No seconds? All myself?\n     Why, this would make a man a man of salt,\n     To use his eyes for garden waterpots,\n     Ay, and laying autumn's dust.\n  Gent. Good sir-\n  Lear. I will die bravely, like a smug bridegroom. What!\n     I will be jovial. Come, come, I am a king;\n     My masters, know you that? \n  Gent. You are a royal one, and we obey you.\n  Lear. Then there's life in't. Nay, an you get it, you shall get\nit\n     by running. Sa, sa, sa, sa!\n                              Exit running. [Attendants follow.]\n  Gent. A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,\n     Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter\n     Who redeems nature from the general curse\n     Which twain have brought her to.\n  Edg. Hail, gentle sir.\n  Gent. Sir, speed you. What's your will?\n  Edg. Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?\n  Gent. Most sure and vulgar. Every one hears that\n     Which can distinguish sound.\n  Edg. But, by your favour,\n     How near's the other army?\n  Gent. Near and on speedy foot. The main descry\n     Stands on the hourly thought.\n  Edg. I thank you sir. That's all.\n  Gent. Though that the Queen on special cause is here,\n     Her army is mov'd on. \n  Edg. I thank you, sir\n                                               Exit [Gentleman].\n  Glou. You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me;\n     Let not my worser spirit tempt me again\n     To die before you please!\n  Edg. Well pray you, father.\n  Glou. Now, good sir, what are you?\n  Edg. A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows,\n     Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,\n     Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand;\n     I'll lead you to some biding.\n  Glou. Hearty thanks.\n     The bounty and the benison of heaven\n     To boot, and boot!\n\n                     Enter [Oswald the] Steward.\n\n  Osw. A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!\n     That eyeless head of thine was first fram'd flesh\n     To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor, \n     Briefly thyself remember. The sword is out\n     That must destroy thee.\n  Glou. Now let thy friendly hand\n     Put strength enough to't.\n                                             [Edgar interposes.]\n  Osw. Wherefore, bold peasant,\n     Dar'st thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence!\n     Lest that th' infection of his fortune take\n     Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.\n  Edg. Chill not let go, zir, without vurther 'cagion.\n  Osw. Let go, slave, or thou diest!\n  Edg. Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor voke pass. An\nchud\n     ha' bin zwagger'd out of my life, 'twould not ha' bin zo\nlong as\n     'tis by a vortnight. Nay, come not near th' old man. Keep\nout,\n     che vore ye, or Ise try whether your costard or my ballow be\nthe\n     harder. Chill be plain with you.\n  Osw. Out, dunghill!\n                                                     They fight.\n  Edg. Chill pick your teeth, zir. Come! No matter vor your\nfoins.\n                                                 [Oswald falls.] \n  Osw. Slave, thou hast slain me. Villain, take my purse.\n     If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body,\n     And give the letters which thou find'st about me\n     To Edmund Earl of Gloucester. Seek him out\n     Upon the British party. O, untimely death! Death!\n                                                        He dies.\n  Edg. I know thee well. A serviceable villain,\n     As duteous to the vices of thy mistress\n     As badness would desire.\n  Glou. What, is he dead?\n  Edg. Sit you down, father; rest you.\n     Let's see his pockets; these letters that he speaks of\n     May be my friends. He's dead. I am only sorry\n     He had no other deathsman. Let us see.\n     Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not.\n     To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;\n     Their papers, is more lawful.             Reads the letter.\n\n       'Let our reciprocal vows be rememb'red. You have many\n     opportunities to cut him off. If your will want not, time\nand\n     place will be fruitfully offer'd. There is nothing done, if\nhe \n     return the conqueror. Then am I the prisoner, and his bed my\n     jail; from the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply\nthe\n     place for your labour.\n           'Your (wife, so I would say) affectionate servant,\n                                                         \n'Goneril.'\n\n     O indistinguish'd space of woman's will!\n     A plot upon her virtuous husband's life,\n     And the exchange my brother! Here in the sands\n     Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified\n     Of murtherous lechers; and in the mature time\n     With this ungracious paper strike the sight\n     Of the death-practis'd Duke, For him 'tis well\n     That of thy death and business I can tell.\n  Glou. The King is mad. How stiff is my vile sense,\n     That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling\n     Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract.\n     So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,\n     And woes by wrong imaginations lose \n     The knowledge of themselves.\n                                                A drum afar off.\n  Edg. Give me your hand.\n     Far off methinks I hear the beaten drum.\n     Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.        Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene VII.\nA tent in the French camp.\n\nEnter Cordelia, Kent, Doctor, and Gentleman.\n\n  Cor. O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work\n     To match thy goodness? My life will be too short\n     And every measure fail me.\n  Kent. To be acknowledg'd, madam, is o'erpaid.\n     All my reports go with the modest truth;\n     Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.\n  Cor. Be better suited.\n     These weeds are memories of those worser hours.\n     I prithee put them off.\n  Kent. Pardon, dear madam.\n     Yet to be known shortens my made intent.\n     My boon I make it that you know me not\n     Till time and I think meet.\n  Cor. Then be't so, my good lord. [To the Doctor] How, does the\nKing?\n  Doct. Madam, sleeps still.\n  Cor. O you kind gods,\n     Cure this great breach in his abused nature! \n     Th' untun'd and jarring senses, O, wind up\n     Of this child-changed father!\n  Doct. So please your Majesty\n     That we may wake the King? He hath slept long.\n  Cor. Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed\n     I' th' sway of your own will. Is he array'd?\n\n              Enter Lear in a chair carried by Servants.\n\n  Gent. Ay, madam. In the heaviness of sleep\n     We put fresh garments on him.\n  Doct. Be by, good madam, when we do awake him.\n     I doubt not of his temperance.\n  Cor. Very well.\n                                                          Music.\n  Doct. Please you draw near. Louder the music there!\n  Cor. O my dear father, restoration hang\n     Thy medicine on my lips, and let this kiss\n     Repair those violent harms that my two sisters\n     Have in thy reverence made! \n  Kent. Kind and dear princess!\n  Cor. Had you not been their father, these white flakes\n     Had challeng'd pity of them. Was this a face\n     To be oppos'd against the warring winds?\n     To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?\n     In the most terrible and nimble stroke\n     Of quick cross lightning? to watch- poor perdu!-\n     With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,\n     Though he had bit me, should have stood that night\n     Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,\n     To hovel thee with swine and rogues forlorn,\n     In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!\n     'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once\n     Had not concluded all.- He wakes. Speak to him.\n  Doct. Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.\n  Cor. How does my royal lord? How fares your Majesty?\n  Lear. You do me wrong to take me out o' th' grave.\n     Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound\n     Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears\n     Do scald like molten lead. \n  Cor. Sir, do you know me?\n  Lear. You are a spirit, I know. When did you die?\n  Cor. Still, still, far wide!\n  Doct. He's scarce awake. Let him alone awhile.\n  Lear. Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight,\n     I am mightily abus'd. I should e'en die with pity,\n     To see another thus. I know not what to say.\n     I will not swear these are my hands. Let's see.\n     I feel this pin prick. Would I were assur'd\n     Of my condition!\n  Cor. O, look upon me, sir,\n     And hold your hands in benediction o'er me.\n     No, sir, you must not kneel.\n  Lear. Pray, do not mock me.\n     I am a very foolish fond old man,\n     Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;\n     And, to deal plainly,\n     I fear I am not in my perfect mind.\n     Methinks I should know you, and know this man;\n     Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant \n     What place this is; and all the skill I have\n     Remembers not these garments; nor I know not\n     Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;\n     For (as I am a man) I think this lady\n     To be my child Cordelia.\n  Cor. And so I am! I am!\n  Lear. Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.\n     If you have poison for me, I will drink it.\n     I know you do not love me; for your sisters\n     Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.\n     You have some cause, they have not.\n  Cor. No cause, no cause.\n  Lear. Am I in France?\n  Kent. In your own kingdom, sir.\n  Lear. Do not abuse me.\n  Doct. Be comforted, good madam. The great rage\n     You see is kill'd in him; and yet it is danger\n     To make him even o'er the time he has lost.\n     Desire him to go in. Trouble him no more\n     Till further settling. \n  Cor. Will't please your Highness walk?\n  Lear. You must bear with me.\n     Pray you now, forget and forgive. I am old and foolish.\n                              Exeunt. Manent Kent and Gentleman.\n  Gent. Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so\nslain?\n  Kent. Most certain, sir.\n  Gent. Who is conductor of his people?\n  Kent. As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.\n  Gent. They say Edgar, his banish'd son, is with the Earl of\nKent\n     in Germany.\n  Kent. Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the powers\nof\n     the kingdom approach apace.\n  Gent. The arbitrement is like to be bloody.\n     Fare you well, sir.                                 [Exit.]\n  Kent. My point and period will be throughly wrought,\n     Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

Know of the Duke if his last purpose hold,\n     Or whether since he is advis'd by aught\n     To change the course. He's full of alteration\n     And self-reproving. Bring his constant pleasure.\n                                              [Exit an Officer.]\n  Reg. Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.\n  Edm. Tis to be doubted, madam.\n  Reg. Now, sweet lord,\n     You know the goodness I intend upon you.\n     Tell me- but truly- but then speak the truth-\n     Do you not love my sister?\n  Edm. In honour'd love.\n  Reg. But have you never found my brother's way\n     To the forfended place?\n  Edm. That thought abuses you.\n  Reg. I am doubtful that you have been conjunct \n     And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.\n  Edm. No, by mine honour, madam.\n  Reg. I never shall endure her.

Our very loving sister, well bemet.\n     Sir, this I hear: the King is come to his daughter,\n     With others whom the rigour of our state\n     Forc'd to cry out. Where I could not be honest,\n     I never yet was valiant. For this business,\n     It toucheth us as France invades our land,\n     Not bolds the King, with others whom, I fear,\n     Most just and heavy causes make oppose.\n  Edm. Sir, you speak nobly. \n  Reg. Why is this reason'd?\n  Gon. Combine together 'gainst the enemy;\n     For these domestic and particular broils\n     Are not the question here.\n  Alb. Let's then determine\n     With th' ancient of war on our proceeding.\n  Edm. I shall attend you presently at your tent.\n  Reg. Sister, you'll go with us?\n  Gon. No.\n  Reg. 'Tis most convenient.

Wretched though I seem,\n     I can produce a champion that will prove\n     What is avouched there. If you miscarry,\n     Your business of the world hath so an end,\n     And machination ceases. Fortune love you!\n  Alb. Stay till I have read the letter.\n  Edg. I was forbid it.\n     When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,\n     And I'll appear again.\n  Alb. Why, fare thee well. I will o'erlook thy paper.\n                                                   Exit [Edgar].\n\n                            Enter Edmund.\n\n  Edm. The enemy 's in view; draw up your powers.\n     Here is the guess of their true strength and forces\n     By diligent discovery; but your haste\n     Is now urg'd on you.\n  Alb. We will greet the time.                             Exit.\n  Edm. To both these sisters have I sworn my love; \n     Each jealous of the other, as the stung\n     Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?\n     Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,\n     If both remain alive. To take the widow\n     Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;\n     And hardly shall I carry out my side,\n     Her husband being alive. Now then, we'll use\n     His countenance for the battle, which being done,\n     Let her who would be rid of him devise\n     His speedy taking off. As for the mercy\n     Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia-\n     The battle done, and they within our power,\n     Shall never see his pardon; for my state\n     Stands on me to defend, not to debate.                Exit.\n\n\n\n\nScene II.\nA field between the two camps.\n\nAlarum within. Enter, with Drum and Colours, the Powers of France\nover the stage, Cordelia with her Father in her hand, and exeunt.\n\nEnter Edgar and Gloucester.\n\n  Edg. Here, father, take the shadow of this tree\n     For your good host. Pray that the right may thrive.\n     If ever I return to you again,\n     I'll bring you comfort.\n  Glou. Grace go with you, sir!\n                                                   Exit [Edgar].\n\n               Alarum and retreat within. Enter Edgar,\n\n  Edg. Away, old man! give me thy hand! away!\n     King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.\n     Give me thy hand! come on!\n  Glou. No further, sir. A man may rot even here. \n  Edg. What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure\n     Their going hence, even as their coming hither;\n     Ripeness is all. Come on.\n  Glou. And that's true too.                             Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nScene III.\nThe British camp, near Dover.\n\nEnter, in conquest, with Drum and Colours, Edmund; Lear and\nCordelia\nas prisoners; Soldiers, Captain.\n\n  Edm. Some officers take them away. Good guard\n     Until their greater pleasures first be known\n     That are to censure them.\n  Cor. We are not the first\n     Who with best meaning have incurr'd the worst.\n     For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;\n     Myself could else outfrown false Fortune's frown.\n     Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?\n  Lear. No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison.\n     We two alone will sing like birds i' th' cage.\n     When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down\n     And ask of thee forgiveness. So we'll live,\n     And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh\n     At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues\n     Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too-\n     Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out- \n     And take upon 's the mystery of things,\n     As if we were God's spies; and we'll wear out,\n     In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones\n     That ebb and flow by th' moon.\n  Edm. Take them away.\n  Lear. Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,\n     The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?\n     He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven\n     And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes.\n     The goodyears shall devour 'em, flesh and fell,\n     Ere they shall make us weep! We'll see 'em starv'd first.\n     Come.                  Exeunt [Lear and Cordelia, guarded].\n  Edm. Come hither, Captain; hark.\n     Take thou this note [gives a paper]. Go follow them to\nprison.\n     One step I have advanc'd thee. If thou dost\n     As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way\n     To noble fortunes. Know thou this, that men\n     Are as the time is. To be tender-minded\n     Does not become a sword. Thy great employment\n     Will not bear question. Either say thou'lt do't, \n     Or thrive by other means.\n  Capt. I'll do't, my lord.\n  Edm. About it! and write happy when th' hast done.\n     Mark- I say, instantly; and carry it so\n     As I have set it down.\n  Capt. I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;\n     If it be man's work, I'll do't.                       Exit.\n\n          Flourish. Enter Albany, Goneril, Regan, Soldiers.\n\n  Alb. Sir, you have show'd to-day your valiant strain,\n     And fortune led you well. You have the captives\n     Who were the opposites of this day's strife.\n     We do require them of you, so to use them\n     As we shall find their merits and our safety\n     May equally determine.\n  Edm. Sir, I thought it fit\n     To send the old and miserable King\n     To some retention and appointed guard;\n     Whose age has charms in it, whose title more, \n     To pluck the common bosom on his side\n     And turn our impress'd lances in our eyes\n     Which do command them. With him I sent the Queen,\n     My reason all the same; and they are ready\n     To-morrow, or at further space, t' appear\n     Where you shall hold your session. At this time\n     We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;\n     And the best quarrels, in the heat, are curs'd\n     By those that feel their sharpness.\n     The question of Cordelia and her father\n     Requires a fitter place.\n  Alb. Sir, by your patience,\n     I hold you but a subject of this war,\n     Not as a brother.\n  Reg. That's as we list to grace him.\n     Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded\n     Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers,\n     Bore the commission of my place and person,\n     The which immediacy may well stand up\n     And call itself your brother. \n  Gon. Not so hot!\n     In his own grace he doth exalt himself\n     More than in your addition.\n  Reg. In my rights\n     By me invested, he compeers the best.\n  Gon. That were the most if he should husband you.\n  Reg. Jesters do oft prove prophets.\n  Gon. Holla, holla!\n     That eye that told you so look'd but asquint.\n  Reg. Lady, I am not well; else I should answer\n     From a full-flowing stomach. General,\n     Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;\n     Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine.\n     Witness the world that I create thee here\n     My lord and master.\n  Gon. Mean you to enjoy him?\n  Alb. The let-alone lies not in your good will.\n  Edm. Nor in thine, lord.\n  Alb. Half-blooded fellow, yes.\n  Reg. [to Edmund] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.\n\n  Alb. Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee\n     On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,\n     This gilded serpent [points to Goneril]. For your claim,\nfair\n        sister,\n     I bar it in the interest of my wife.\n     'Tis she is subcontracted to this lord,\n     And I, her husband, contradict your banes.\n     If you will marry, make your loves to me;\n     My lady is bespoke.\n  Gon. An interlude!\n  Alb. Thou art arm'd, Gloucester. Let the trumpet sound.\n     If none appear to prove upon thy person\n     Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,\n     There is my pledge [throws down a glove]! I'll prove it on\nthy\n        heart,\n     Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less\n     Than I have here proclaim'd thee.\n  Reg. Sick, O, sick!\n  Gon. [aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.\n  Edm. There's my exchange [throws down a glove]. What in the\nworld \n        he is\n     That names me traitor, villain-like he lies.\n     Call by thy trumpet. He that dares approach,\n     On him, on you, who not? I will maintain\n     My truth and honour firmly.\n  Alb. A herald, ho!\n  Edm. A herald, ho, a herald!\n  Alb. Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,\n     All levied in my name, have in my name\n     Took their discharge.\n  Reg. My sickness grows upon me.\n  Alb. She is not well. Convey her to my tent.\n                                              [Exit Regan, led.]\n\n                           Enter a Herald.\n\n     Come hither, herald. Let the trumpet sound,\n     And read out this.\n  Capt. Sound, trumpet!                        A trumpet sounds.\n \n  Her. (reads) 'If any man of quality or degree within the lists\nof\n     the army will maintain upon Edmund, supposed Earl of\nGloucester,\n     that he is a manifold traitor, let him appear by the third\nsound\n     of the trumpet. He is bold in his defence.'\n\n  Edm. Sound!                                     First trumpet.\n  Her. Again!                                    Second trumpet.\n  Her. Again!                                     Third trumpet.\n                                         Trumpet answers within.\n\n    Enter Edgar, armed, at the third sound, a Trumpet before him.\n\n  Alb. Ask him his purposes, why he appears\n     Upon this call o' th' trumpet.\n  Her. What are you?\n     Your name, your quality? and why you answer\n     This present summons?\n  Edg. Know my name is lost;\n     By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit.\n     Yet am I noble as the adversary \n     I come to cope.\n  Alb. Which is that adversary?\n  Edg. What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?\n  Edm. Himself. What say'st thou to him?\n  Edg. Draw thy sword,\n     That, if my speech offend a noble heart,\n     Thy arm may do thee justice. Here is mine.\n     Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,\n     My oath, and my profession. I protest-\n     Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,\n     Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,\n     Thy valour and thy heart- thou art a traitor;\n     False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;\n     Conspirant 'gainst this high illustrious prince;\n     And from th' extremest upward of thy head\n     To the descent and dust beneath thy foot,\n     A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'no,'\n     This sword, this arm, and my best spirits are bent\n     To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,\n     Thou liest. \n  Edm. In wisdom I should ask thy name;\n     But since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,\n     And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,\n     What safe and nicely I might well delay\n     By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn.\n     Back do I toss those treasons to thy head;\n     With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;\n     Which- for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise-\n     This sword of mine shall give them instant way\n     Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!\n                                 Alarums. Fight. [Edmund falls.]\n  Alb. Save him, save him!\n  Gon. This is mere practice, Gloucester.\n     By th' law of arms thou wast not bound to answer\n     An unknown opposite. Thou art not vanquish'd,\n     But cozen'd and beguil'd.\n  Alb. Shut your mouth, dame,\n     Or with this paper shall I stop it. [Shows her her letter to\n     Edmund.]- [To Edmund]. Hold, sir.\n     [To Goneril] Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil. \n     No tearing, lady! I perceive you know it.\n  Gon. Say if I do- the laws are mine, not thine.\n     Who can arraign me for't?\n  Alb. Most monstrous!\n     Know'st thou this paper?\n  Gon. Ask me not what I know.                             Exit.\n  Alb. Go after her. She's desperate; govern her.\n                                              [Exit an Officer.]\n  Edm. What, you have charg'd me with, that have I done,\n     And more, much more. The time will bring it out.\n     'Tis past, and so am I.- But what art thou\n     That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,\n     I do forgive thee.\n  Edg. Let's exchange charity.\n     I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;\n     If more, the more th' hast wrong'd me.\n     My name is Edgar and thy father's son.\n     The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices\n     Make instruments to scourge us.\n     The dark and vicious place where thee he got \n     Cost him his eyes.\n  Edm. Th' hast spoken right; 'tis true.\n     The wheel is come full circle; I am here.\n  Alb. Methought thy very gait did prophesy\n     A royal nobleness. I must embrace thee.\n     Let sorrow split my heart if ever I\n     Did hate thee, or thy father!\n  Edg. Worthy prince, I know't.\n  Alb. Where have you hid yourself?\n     How have you known the miseries of your father?\n  Edg. By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;\n     And when 'tis told, O that my heart would burst!\n     The bloody proclamation to escape\n     That follow'd me so near (O, our lives' sweetness!\n     That with the pain of death would hourly die\n     Rather than die at once!) taught me to shift\n     Into a madman's rags, t' assume a semblance\n     That very dogs disdain'd; and in this habit\n     Met I my father with his bleeding rings,\n     Their precious stones new lost; became his guide, \n     Led him, begg'd for him, sav'd him from despair;\n     Never (O fault!) reveal'd myself unto him\n     Until some half hour past, when I was arm'd,\n     Not sure, though hoping of this good success,\n     I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last\n     Told him my pilgrimage. But his flaw'd heart\n     (Alack, too weak the conflict to support!)\n     'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,\n     Burst smilingly.\n  Edm. This speech of yours hath mov'd me,\n     And shall perchance do good; but speak you on;\n     You look as you had something more to say.\n  Alb. If there be more, more woful, hold it in;\n     For I am almost ready to dissolve,\n     Hearing of this.\n  Edg. This would have seem'd a period\n     To such as love not sorrow; but another,\n     To amplify too much, would make much more,\n     And top extremity.\n     Whilst I was big in clamour, came there a man, \n     Who, having seen me in my worst estate,\n     Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding\n     Who 'twas that so endur'd, with his strong arms\n     He fastened on my neck, and bellowed out\n     As he'd burst heaven; threw him on my father;\n     Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him\n     That ever ear receiv'd; which in recounting\n     His grief grew puissant, and the strings of life\n     Began to crack. Twice then the trumpets sounded,\n     And there I left him tranc'd.\n  Alb. But who was this?\n  Edg. Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise\n     Followed his enemy king and did him service\n     Improper for a slave.\n\n                Enter a Gentleman with a bloody knife.\n\n  Gent. Help, help! O, help!\n  Edg. What kind of help?\n  Alb. Speak, man. \n  Edg. What means that bloody knife?\n  Gent. 'Tis hot, it smokes.\n     It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!\n  Alb. Who dead? Speak, man.\n  Gent. Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister\n     By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.\n  Edm. I was contracted to them both. All three\n     Now marry in an instant.\n\n                             Enter Kent.\n\n  Edg. Here comes Kent.\n  Alb. Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.\n                                               [Exit Gentleman.]\n     This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble\n     Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?\n     The time will not allow the compliment\n     That very manners urges.\n  Kent. I am come\n     To bid my king and master aye good night. \n     Is he not here?\n  Alb. Great thing of us forgot!\n     Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?\n                 The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.\n     Seest thou this object, Kent?\n  Kent. Alack, why thus?\n  Edm. Yet Edmund was belov'd.\n     The one the other poisoned for my sake,\n     And after slew herself.\n  Alb. Even so. Cover their faces.\n  Edm. I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,\n     Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send\n     (Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ\n     Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.\n     Nay, send in time.\n  Alb. Run, run, O, run!\n  Edg. To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send\n     Thy token of reprieve.\n  Edm. Well thought on. Take my sword;\n     Give it the Captain. \n  Alb. Haste thee for thy life.                    [Exit Edgar.]\n  Edm. He hath commission from thy wife and me\n     To hang Cordelia in the prison and\n     To lay the blame upon her own despair\n     That she fordid herself.\n  Alb. The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.\n                                          [Edmund is borne off.]\n\n    Enter Lear, with Cordelia [dead] in his arms, [Edgar,\nCaptain,\n                        and others following].\n\n  Lear. Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.\n     Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so\n     That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!\n     I know when one is dead, and when one lives.\n     She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.\n     If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\n     Why, then she lives.\n  Kent. Is this the promis'd end?\n  Edg. Or image of that horror? \n  Alb. Fall and cease!\n  Lear. This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,\n     It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\n     That ever I have felt.\n  Kent. O my good master!\n  Lear. Prithee away!\n  Edg. 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.\n  Lear. A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!\n     I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!\n     Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!\n     What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,\n     Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.\n     I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.\n  Capt. 'Tis true, my lords, he did.\n  Lear. Did I not, fellow?\n     I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion\n     I would have made them skip. I am old now,\n     And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?\n     Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.\n  Kent. If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated, \n     One of them we behold.\n  Lear. This' a dull sight. Are you not Kent?\n  Kent. The same-\n     Your servant Kent. Where is your servant Caius?\n  Lear. He's a good fellow, I can tell you that.\n     He'll strike, and quickly too. He's dead and rotten.\n  Kent. No, my good lord; I am the very man-\n  Lear. I'll see that straight.\n  Kent. That from your first of difference and decay\n     Have followed your sad steps.\n  Lear. You're welcome hither.\n  Kent. Nor no man else! All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.\n     Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\n     And desperately are dead.\n  Lear. Ay, so I think.\n  Alb. He knows not what he says; and vain is it\n     That we present us to him.\n  Edg. Very bootless.\n\n                           Enter a Captain. \n\n  Capt. Edmund is dead, my lord.\n  Alb. That's but a trifle here.\n     You lords and noble friends, know our intent.\n     What comfort to this great decay may come\n     Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,\n     During the life of this old Majesty,\n     To him our absolute power; [to Edgar and Kent] you to your\n        rights;\n     With boot, and Such addition as your honours\n     Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste\n     The wages of their virtue, and all foes\n     The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!\n  Lear. And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!\n     Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,\n     And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,\n     Never, never, never, never, never!\n     Pray you undo this button. Thank you, sir.\n     Do you see this? Look on her! look! her lips!\n     Look there, look there!                            He dies. \n  Edg. He faints! My lord, my lord!\n  Kent. Break, heart; I prithee break!\n  Edg. Look up, my lord.\n  Kent. Vex not his ghost. O, let him pass! He hates him\n     That would upon the rack of this tough world\n     Stretch him out longer.\n  Edg. He is gone indeed.\n  Kent. The wonder is, he hath endur'd so long.\n     He but usurp'd his life.\n  Alb. Bear them from hence. Our present business\n     Is general woe. [To Kent and Edgar] Friends of my soul, you\n        twain\n     Rule in this realm, and the gor'd state sustain.\n  Kent. I have a journey, sir, shortly to go.\n     My master calls me; I must not say no.\n  Alb. The weight of this sad time we must obey,\n     Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.\n     The oldest have borne most; we that are young\n     Shall never see so much, nor live so long.\n                                       Exeunt with a dead march.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n\n"

[_Exit._\n\n  _Enter _Mariners_._\n\n_Boats._ Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!              5\nyare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the master\x92s\nwhistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind, if room enough!\n\n  _Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO,\n  and others._\n\n_Alon._ Good boatswain, have care. Where\x92s the master?\nPlay the men.\n\n_Boats._ I pray now, keep below.                                    10\n\n_Ant._ Where is the master, boatswain?\n\n_Boats._ Do you not hear him? You mar our labour:\nkeep your cabins: you do assist the storm.\n\n_Gon._ Nay, good, be patient.\n\n_Boats._ When the sea is. Hence! What cares these                   15\nroarers for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble\nus not.\n\n_Gon._ Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.\n\n_Boats._ None that I more love than myself. You are a\nCounsellor; if you can command these elements to silence,           20\nand work the peace of the present, we will not hand a rope\nmore; use your authority: if you cannot, give thanks you\nhave lived so long, and make yourself ready in your cabin\nfor the mischance of the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good\nhearts! Out of our way, I say.    [_Exit._                          25\n\n_Gon._ I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks\nhe hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is\nperfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his hanging:\nmake the rope of his destiny our cable, for our own doth\nlittle advantage. If he be not born to be hanged, our case          30\nis miserable.    [_Exeunt._\n\n  _Re-enter Boatswain._\n\n_Boats._ Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower!\nBring her to try with main-course. [_A cry within._] A\nplague upon this howling! they are louder than the weather\nor our office.                                                      35\n\n  _Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO._\n\nYet again! what do you here? Shall we give o\x92er, and\ndrown? Have you a mind to sink?\n\n_Seb._ A pox o\x92 your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,\nincharitable dog!\n\n_Boats._ Work you, then.                                            40\n\n_Ant._ Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noise-maker.\nWe are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.\n\n_Gon._ I\x92ll warrant him for drowning; though the ship\nwere no stronger than a nutshell, and as leaky as an unstanched\nwench.                                                              45\n\n_Boats._ Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off\nto sea again; lay her off.\n\n  _Enter _Mariners_ wet._\n\n_Mariners._ All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!\n\n_Boats._ What, must our mouths be cold?\n\n_Gon._ The king and prince at prayers! let\x92s assist them,           50\nFor our case is as theirs.\n\n_Seb._                   I\x92m out of patience.\n\n_Ant._ We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:\nThis wide-chapp\x92d rascal,--would thou mightst lie drowning\nThe washing of ten tides!\n\n_Gon._                  He\x92ll be hang\x92d yet,\nThough every drop of water swear against it,                        55\nAnd gape at widest to glut him.\n\n  [_A confused noise within:_ \x93Mercy on us!\x94--\n  \x93We split, we split!\x94-- \x93Farewell my wife and children!\x94--\n  \x93Farewell, brother!\x94-- \x93We split, we split, we split!\x94]\n\n_Ant._ Let\x92s all sink with the king.                                60\n\n_Seb._ Let\x92s take leave of him. [_Exeunt Ant. and Seb._\n\n_Gon._ Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for\nan acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any\nthing. The wills above be done! but I would fain die a\ndry death.    [_Exeunt._                                            65\n\n\n  Notes: I, 1.\n\n  SC. I. On a ship at sea] Pope.\n  Enter ...

Before PROSPERO\x92S cell._\n\n  _Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA._\n\n_Mir._ If by your art, my dearest father, you have\nPut the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\nThe sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,\nBut that the sea, mounting to the welkin\x92s cheek,\nDashes the fire out. O, I have suffer\x92d                              5\nWith those that I saw suffer! a brave vessel,\nWho had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,\nDash\x92d all to pieces. O, the cry did knock\nAgainst my very heart! Poor souls, they perish\x92d!\nHad I been any god of power, I would                                10\nHave sunk the sea within the earth, or ere\nIt should the good ship so have swallow\x92d and\nThe fraughting souls within her.\n\n_Pros._                        Be collected:\nNo more amazement: tell your piteous heart\nThere\x92s no harm done.\n\n_Mir._              O, woe the day!\n\n_Pros._                           No harm.                          15\nI have done nothing but in care of thee,\nOf thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who\nArt ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing\nOf whence I am, nor that I am more better\nThan Prospero, master of a full poor cell,                          20\nAnd thy no greater father.\n\n_Mir._                   More to know\nDid never meddle with my thoughts.\n\n_Pros._                          \x92Tis time\nI should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,\nAnd pluck my magic garment from me. --So:\n                                [_Lays down his mantle._\nLie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.              25\nThe direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch\x92d\nThe very virtue of compassion in thee,\nI have with such provision in mine art\nSo safely order\x92d, that there is no soul,\nNo, not so much perdition as an hair                                30\nBetid to any creature in the vessel\nWhich thou heard\x92st cry, which thou saw\x92st sink. Sit down;\nFor thou must now know farther.\n\n_Mir._                        You have often\nBegun to tell me what I am; but stopp\x92d,\nAnd left me to a bootless inquisition,                              35\nConcluding \x93Stay: not yet.\x94\n\n_Pros._                The hour\x92s now come;\nThe very minute bids thee ope thine ear;\nObey, and be attentive. Canst thou remember\nA time before we came unto this cell?\nI do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not                   40\nOut three years old.\n\n_Mir._             Certainly, sir, I can.\n\n_Pros._ By what? by any other house or person?\nOf any thing the image tell me that\nHath kept with thy remembrance.\n\n_Mir._                        \x92Tis far off,\nAnd rather like a dream than an assurance                           45\nThat my remembrance warrants. Had I not\nFour or five women once that tended me?\n\n_Pros._ Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it\nThat this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else\nIn the dark backward and abysm of time?                             50\nIf thou remember\x92st ought ere thou camest here,\nHow thou camest here thou mayst.\n\n_Mir._                         But that I do not.\n\n_Pros._ Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,\nThy father was the Duke of Milan, and\nA prince of power.\n\n_Mir._           Sir, are not you my father?                        55\n\n_Pros._ Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and\nShe said thou wast my daughter; and thy father\nWas Duke of Milan; and his only heir\nAnd princess, no worse issued.\n\n_Mir._                       O the heavens!\nWhat foul play had we, that we came from thence?                    60\nOr blessed was\x92t we did?\n\n_Pros._                Both, both, my girl:\nBy foul play, as thou say\x92st, were we heaved thence;\nBut blessedly holp hither.\n\n_Mir._                   O, my heart bleeds\nTo think o\x92 the teen that I have turn\x92d you to.\nWhich is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.                  65\n\n_Pros._ My brother, and thy uncle, call\x92d Antonio,--\nI pray thee, mark me,--that a brother should\nBe so perfidious!--he whom, next thyself,\nOf all the world I loved, and to him put\nThe manage of my state; as, at that time,                           70\nThrough all the signories it was the first,\nAnd Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed\nIn dignity, and for the liberal arts\nWithout a parallel; those being all my study,\nThe government I cast upon my brother,                              75\nAnd to my state grew stranger, being transported\nAnd rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--\nDost thou attend me?\n\n_Mir._             Sir, most heedfully.\n\n_Pros._ Being once perfected how to grant suits,\nHow to deny them, whom to advance, and whom                         80\nTo trash for over-topping, new created\nThe creatures that were mine, I say, or changed \x92em,\nOr else new form\x92d \x92em; having both the key\nOf officer and office, set all hearts i\x92 the state\nTo what tune pleased his ear; that now he was                       85\nThe ivy which had hid my princely trunk,\nAnd suck\x92d my verdure out on\x92t. Thou attend\x92st not.\n\n_Mir._ O, good sir, I do.\n\n_Pros._                 I pray thee, mark me.\nI, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated\nTo closeness and the bettering of my mind                           90\nWith that which, but by being so retired,\nO\x92er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother\nAwaked an evil nature; and my trust,\nLike a good parent, did beget of him\nA falsehood in its contrary, as great                               95\nAs my trust was; which had indeed no limit,\nA confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,\nNot only with what my revenue yielded,\nBut what my power might else exact, like one\nWho having into truth, by telling of it,                           100\nMade such a sinner of his memory,\nTo credit his own lie, he did believe\nHe was indeed the duke; out o\x92 the substitution,\nAnd executing the outward face of royalty,\nWith all prerogative:--hence his ambition growing,--               105\nDost thou hear?\n\n_Mir._        Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.\n\n_Pros._ To have no screen between this part he play\x92d\nAnd him he play\x92d it for, he needs will be\nAbsolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library\nWas dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties                    110\nHe thinks me now incapable; confederates,\nSo dry he was for sway, wi\x92 the King of Naples\nTo give him annual tribute, do him homage,\nSubject his coronet to his crown, and bend\nThe dukedom, yet unbow\x92d,--alas, poor Milan!--                     115\nTo most ignoble stooping.\n\n_Mir._                  O the heavens!\n\n_Pros._ Mark his condition, and th\x92 event; then tell me\nIf this might be a brother.\n\n_Mir._                    I should sin\nTo think but nobly of my grandmother:\nGood wombs have borne bad sons.\n\n_Pros._                       Now the condition.                   120\nThis King of Naples, being an enemy\nTo me inveterate, hearkens my brother\x92s suit;\nWhich was, that he, in lieu o\x92 the premises,\nOf homage and I know not how much tribute,\nShould presently extirpate me and mine                             125\nOut of the dukedom, and confer fair Milan,\nWith all the honours, on my brother: whereon,\nA treacherous army levied, one midnight\nFated to the purpose, did Antonio open\nThe gates of Milan; and, i\x92 the dead of darkness,                  130\nThe ministers for the purpose hurried thence\nMe and thy crying self.\n\n_Mir._                Alack, for pity!\nI, not remembering how I cried out then,\nWill cry it o\x92er again: it is a hint\nThat wrings mine eyes to\x92t.\n\n_Pros._                   Hear a little further,                   135\nAnd then I\x92ll bring thee to the present business\nWhich now\x92s upon \x92s; without the which, this story\nWere most impertinent.\n\n_Mir._               Wherefore did they not\nThat hour destroy us?\n\n_Pros._             Well demanded, wench:\nMy tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,              140\nSo dear the love my people bore me; nor set\nA mark so bloody on the business; but\nWith colours fairer painted their foul ends.\nIn few, they hurried us aboard a bark,\nBore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared                   145\nA rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg\x92d,\nNor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats\nInstinctively have quit it: there they hoist us,\nTo cry to the sea that roar\x92d to us; to sigh\nTo the winds, whose pity, sighing back again,                      150\nDid us but loving wrong.\n\n_Mir._                 Alack, what trouble\nWas I then to you!\n\n_Pros._          O, a cherubin\nThou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile,\nInfused with a fortitude from heaven,\nWhen I have deck\x92d the sea with drops full salt,                   155\nUnder my burthen groan\x92d; which raised in me\nAn undergoing stomach, to bear up\nAgainst what should ensue.\n\n_Mir._                   How came we ashore?\n\n_Pros._ By Providence divine.\nSome food we had, and some fresh water, that                       160\nA noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,\nOut of his charity, who being then appointed\nMaster of this design, did give us, with\nRich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,\nWhich since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,              165\nKnowing I loved my books, he furnish\x92d me\nFrom mine own library with volumes that\nI prize above my dukedom.\n\n_Mir._                  Would I might\nBut ever see that man!\n\n_Pros._              Now I arise:  [_Resumes his mantle._\nSit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.                    170\nHere in this island we arrived; and here\nHave I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit\nThan other princesses can, that have more time\nFor vainer hours, and tutors not so careful.\n\n_Mir._ Heavens thank you for\x92t! And now, I pray you, sir,          175\nFor still \x92tis beating in my mind, your reason\nFor raising this sea-storm?\n\n_Pros._                   Know thus far forth.\nBy accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,\nNow my dear lady, hath mine enemies\nBrought to this shore; and by my prescience                        180\nI find my zenith doth depend upon\nA most auspicious star, whose influence\nIf now I court not, but omit, my fortunes\nWill ever after droop. Here cease more questions:\nThou art inclined to sleep; \x92tis a good dulness,                   185\nAnd give it way: I know thou canst not choose.\n                                        [_Miranda sleeps._\nCome away, servant, come. I am ready now.\nApproach, my Ariel, come.\n\n  _Enter _ARIEL_._\n\n_Ari._ All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come\nTo answer thy best pleasure; be\x92t to fly,                          190\nTo swim, to dive into the fire, to ride\nOn the curl\x92d clouds, to thy strong bidding task\nAriel and all his quality.\n\n_Pros._                  Hast thou, spirit,\nPerform\x92d to point the tempest that I bade thee?\n\n_Ari._ To every article.                                           195\nI boarded the king\x92s ship; now on the beak,\nNow in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,\nI flamed amazement: sometime I\x92ld divide,\nAnd burn in many places; on the topmast,\nThe yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,                  200\nThen meet and join. Jove\x92s lightnings, the precursors\nO\x92 the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary\nAnd sight-outrunning were not: the fire and cracks\nOf sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune\nSeem to besiege, and make his bold waves tremble,                  205\nYea, his dread trident shake.\n\n_Pros._                     My brave spirit!\nWho was so firm, so constant, that this coil\nWould not infect his reason?\n\n_Ari._                     Not a soul\nBut felt a fever of the mad, and play\x92d\nSome tricks of desperation. All but mariners                       210\nPlunged in the foaming brine, and quit the vessel,\nThen all afire with me: the king\x92s son, Ferdinand,\nWith hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--\nWas the first man that leap\x92d; cried, \x93Hell is empty,\nAnd all the devils are here.\x94\n\n_Pros._                 Why, that\x92s my spirit!                     215\nBut was not this nigh shore?\n\n_Ari._                    Close by, my master.\n\n_Pros._ But are they, Ariel, safe?\n\n_Ari._                           Not a hair perish\x92d;\nOn their sustaining garments not a blemish,\nBut fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,\nIn troops I have dispersed them \x92bout the isle.                    220\nThe king\x92s son have I landed by himself;\nWhom I left cooling of the air with sighs\nIn an odd angle of the isle, and sitting,\nHis arms in this sad knot.\n\n_Pros._                  Of the king\x92s ship\nThe mariners, say how thou hast disposed,                          225\nAnd all the rest o\x92 the fleet.\n\n_Ari._                       Safely in harbour\nIs the king\x92s ship; in the deep nook, where once\nThou call\x92dst me up at midnight to fetch dew\nFrom the still-vex\x92d Bermoothes, there she\x92s hid:\nThe mariners all under hatches stow\x92d;                             230\nWho, with a charm join\x92d to their suffer\x92d labour,\nI have left asleep: and for the rest o\x92 the fleet,\nWhich I dispersed, they all have met again,\nAnd are upon the Mediterranean flote,\nBound sadly home for Naples;                                       235\nSupposing that they saw the king\x92s ship wreck\x92d,\nAnd his great person perish.\n\n_Pros._                    Ariel, thy charge\nExactly is perform\x92d: but there\x92s more work.\nWhat is the time o\x92 the day?\n\n_Ari._                     Past the mid season.\n\n_Pros._ At least two glasses. The time \x92twixt six and now          240\nMust by us both be spent most preciously.\n\n_Ari._ Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,\nLet me remember thee what thou hast promised,\nWhich is not yet perform\x92d me.\n\n_Pros._                      How now? moody?\nWhat is\x92t thou canst demand?\n\n_Ari._                     My liberty.                             245\n\n_Pros._ Before the time be out? no more!\n\n_Ari._                                 I prithee,\nRemember I have done thee worthy service;\nTold thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served\nWithout or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise\nTo bate me a full year.\n\n_Pros._               Dost thou forget                             250\nFrom what a torment I did free thee?\n\n_Ari._                             No.\n\n_Pros._ Thou dost; and think\x92st it much to tread the ooze\nOf the salt deep,\nTo run upon the sharp wind of the north,\nTo do me business in the veins o\x92 the earth                        255\nWhen it is baked with frost.\n\n_Ari._                     I do not, sir.\n\n_Pros._ Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot\nThe foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy\nWas grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?\n\n_Ari._ No, sir.\n\n_Pros._       Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.       260\n\n_Ari._ Sir, in Argier.\n\n_Pros._              O, was she so? I must\nOnce in a month recount what thou hast been,\nWhich thou forget\x92st. This damn\x92d witch Sycorax,\nFor mischiefs manifold, and sorceries terrible\nTo enter human hearing, from Argier,                               265\nThou know\x92st, was banish\x92d: for one thing she did\nThey would not take her life. Is not this true?\n\n_Ari._ Ay, sir.\n\n_Pros._ This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child,\nAnd here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,                  270\nAs thou report\x92st thyself, wast then her servant;\nAnd, for thou wast a spirit too delicate\nTo act her earthy and abhorr\x92d commands,\nRefusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,\nBy help of her more potent ministers,                              275\nAnd in her most unmitigable rage,\nInto a cloven pine; within which rift\nImprison\x92d thou didst painfully remain\nA dozen years; within which space she died,\nAnd left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans              280\nAs fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--\nSave for the son that she did litter here,\nA freckled whelp hag-born--not honour\x92d with\nA human shape.\n\n_Ari._       Yes, Caliban her son.\n\n_Pros._ Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban,                    285\nWhom now I keep in service. Thou best know\x92st\nWhat torment I did find thee in; thy groans\nDid make wolves howl, and penetrate the breasts\nOf ever-angry bears: it was a torment\nTo lay upon the damn\x92d, which Sycorax                              290\nCould not again undo: it was mine art,\nWhen I arrived and heard thee, that made gape\nThe pine, and let thee out.\n\n_Ari._                    I thank thee, master.\n\n_Pros._ If thou more murmur\x92st, I will rend an oak,\nAnd peg thee in his knotty entrails, till                          295\nThou hast howl\x92d away twelve winters.\n\n_Ari._                              Pardon, master:\nI will be correspondent to command,\nAnd do my spiriting gently.\n\n_Pros._                   Do so; and after two days\nI will discharge thee.\n\n_Ari._               That\x92s my noble master!\nWhat shall I do? say what; what shall I do?                        300\n\n_Pros._ Go make thyself like a nymph o\x92 the sea:\nBe subject to no sight but thine and mine; invisible\nTo every eyeball else. Go take this shape,\nAnd hither come in\x92t: go, hence with diligence!\n\n    [_Exit Ariel._\n\nAwake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well;                    305\nAwake!\n\n_Mir._ The strangeness of your story put\nHeaviness in me.\n\n_Pros._        Shake it off. Come on;\nWe\x92ll visit Caliban my slave, who never\nYields us kind answer.\n\n_Mir._               \x92Tis a villain, sir,\nI do not love to look on.\n\n_Pros._                 But, as \x92tis,                              310\nWe cannot miss him: he does make our fire,\nFetch in our wood, and serves in offices\nThat profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!\nThou earth, thou! speak.\n\n_Cal._ [_within_] There\x92s wood enough within.\n\n_Pros._ Come forth, I say! there\x92s other business for thee:        315\nCome, thou tortoise! when?\n\n  _Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph._\n\nFine apparition! My quaint Ariel,\nHark in thine ear.\n\n_Ari._           My lord, it shall be done.    [_Exit._\n\n_Pros._ Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself\nUpon thy wicked dam, come forth!                                   320\n\n  _Enter CALIBAN._\n\n_Cal._ As wicked dew as e\x92er my mother brush\x92d\nWith raven\x92s feather from unwholesome fen\nDrop on you both! a south-west blow on ye\nAnd blister you all o\x92er!\n\n_Pros._ For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,        325\nSide-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins\nShall, for that vast of night that they may work,\nAll exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch\x92d\nAs thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging\nThan bees that made \x92em.\n\n_Cal._                 I must eat my dinner.                       330\nThis island\x92s mine, by Sycorax my mother,\nWhich thou takest from me. When thou camest first,\nThou strokedst me, and madest much of me; wouldst give me\nWater with berries in\x92t; and teach me how\nTo name the bigger light, and how the less,                        335\nThat burn by day and night: and then I loved thee,\nAnd show\x92d thee all the qualities o\x92 th\x92 isle,\nThe fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:\nCurs\x92d be I that did so! All the charms\nOf Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!                    340\nFor I am all the subjects that you have,\nWhich first was mine own king: and here you sty me\nIn this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me\nThe rest o\x92 th\x92 island.\n\n_Pros._               Thou most lying slave,\nWhom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,             345\nFilth as thou art, with human care; and lodged thee\nIn mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate\nThe honour of my child.\n\n_Cal._ O ho, O ho! would \x92t had been done!\nThou didst prevent me; I had peopled else                          350\nThis isle with Calibans.\n\n_Pros._                Abhorred slave,\nWhich any print of goodness wilt not take,\nBeing capable of all ill! I pitied thee,\nTook pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour\nOne thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,                   355\nKnow thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like\nA thing most brutish, I endow\x92d thy purposes\nWith words that made them known. But thy vile race,\nThough thou didst learn, had that in\x92t which good natures\nCould not abide to be with; therefore wast thou                    360\nDeservedly confined into this rock,\nWho hadst deserved more than a prison.\n\n_Cal._ You taught me language; and my profit on\x92t\nIs, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you\nFor learning me your language!\n\n_Pros._                      Hag-seed, hence!                      365\nFetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou\x92rt best,\nTo answer other business.

Our hint of woe\nIs common; every day, some sailor\x92s wife,\nThe masters of some merchant, and the merchant,                      5\nHave just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,\nI mean our preservation, few in millions\nCan speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh\nOur sorrow with our comfort.\n\n_Alon._                    Prithee, peace.\n\n_Seb._ He receives comfort like cold porridge.                      10\n\n_Ant._ The visitor will not give him o\x92er so.\n\n_Seb._ Look, he\x92s winding up the watch of his wit; by\nand by it will strike.\n\n_Gon._ Sir,--\n\n_Seb._ One: tell.                                                   15\n\n_Gon._ When every grief is entertain\x92d that\x92s offer\x92d,\nComes to the entertainer--\n\n_Seb._ A dollar.\n\n_Gon._ Dolour comes to him, indeed: you have spoken\ntruer than you purposed.                                            20\n\n_Seb._ You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.\n\n_Gon._ Therefore, my lord,--\n\n_Ant._ Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!\n\n_Alon._ I prithee, spare.\n\n_Gon._ Well, I have done: but yet,--                                25\n\n_Seb._ He will be talking.\n\n_Ant._ Which, of he or Adrian, for a good wager, first\nbegins to crow?\n\n_Seb._ The old cock.\n\n_Ant._ The cockerel.                                                30\n\n_Seb._ Done.

I mean, in a sort.\n\n_Ant._ That sort was well fished for.\n\n_Gon._ When I wore it at your daughter\x92s marriage?\n\n_Alon._ You cram these words into mine ears against                100\nThe stomach of my sense. Would I had never\nMarried my daughter there! for, coming thence,\nMy son is lost, and, in my rate, she too.\nWho is so far from Italy removed\nI ne\x92er again shall see her. O thou mine heir                      105\nOf Naples and of Milan, what strange fish\nHath made his meal on thee?\n\n_Fran._                   Sir, he may live:\nI saw him beat the surges under him,\nAnd ride upon their backs; he trod the water.\nWhose enmity he flung aside, and breasted                          110\nThe surge most swoln that met him; his bold head\n\x92Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar\x92d\nHimself with his good arms in lusty stroke\nTo the shore, that o\x92er his wave-worn basis bow\x92d,\nAs stooping to relieve him: I not doubt                            115\nHe came alive to land.\n\n_Alon._              No, no, he\x92s gone.\n\n_Seb._ Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,\nThat would not bless our Europe with your daughter,\nBut rather lose her to an African;\nWhere she, at least, is banish\x92d from your eye,                    120\nWho hath cause to wet the grief on\x92t.\n\n_Alon._                             Prithee, peace.\n\n_Seb._ You were kneel\x92d to, and importuned otherwise,\nBy all of us; and the fair soul herself\nWeigh\x92d between loathness and obedience, at\nWhich end o\x92 the beam should bow. We have lost your son,           125\nI fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have\nMore widows in them of this business\x92 making\nThan we bring men to comfort them:\nThe fault\x92s your own.\n\n_Alon._             So is the dear\x92st o\x92 the loss.\n\n_Gon._ My lord Sebastian,                                          130\nThe truth you speak doth lack some gentleness,\nAnd time to speak it in: you rub the sore,\nWhen you should bring the plaster.\n\n_Seb._                           Very well.\n\n_Ant._ And most chirurgeonly.\n\n_Gon._ It is foul weather in us all, good sir,                     135\nWhen you are cloudy.\n\n_Seb._             Foul weather?\n\n_Ant._                         Very foul.\n\n_Gon._ Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--\n\n_Ant._ He\x92ld sow\x92t with nettle-seed.\n\n_Seb._                             Or docks, or mallows.\n\n_Gon._ And were the king on\x92t, what would I do?\n\n_Seb._ \x92Scape being drunk for want of wine.                        140\n\n_Gon._ I\x92 the commonwealth I would by contraries\nExecute all things; for no kind of traffic\nWould I admit; no name of magistrate;\nLetters should not be known; riches, poverty,\nAnd use of service, none; contract, succession,                    145\nBourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;\nNo use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;\nNo occupation; all men idle, all;\nAnd women too, but innocent and pure;\nNo sovereignty;--                                                  150\n\n_Seb._      Yet he would be king on\x92t.\n\n_Ant._ The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the\nbeginning.\n\n_Gon._ All things in common nature should produce\nWithout sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,\nSword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,                    155\nWould I not have; but nature should bring forth,\nOf its own kind, all foison, all abundance,\nTo feed my innocent people.\n\n_Seb._ No marrying \x92mong his subjects?\n\n_Ant._ None, man; all idle; whores and knaves.                     160\n\n_Gon._ I would with such perfection govern, sir,\nTo excel the golden age.\n\n_Seb._                 \x92Save his majesty!\n\n_Ant._ Long live Gonzalo!\n\n_Gon._                  And,--do you mark me, sir?\n\n_Alon._ Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.\n\n_Gon._ I do well believe your highness; and did it to minister     165\noccasion to these gentlemen, who are of such sensible\nand nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing.\n\n_Ant._ \x92Twas you we laughed at.\n\n_Gon._ Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to\nyou: so you may continue, and laugh at nothing still.              170\n\n_Ant._ What a blow was there given!\n\n_Seb._ An it had not fallen flat-long.\n\n_Gon._ You are gentlemen of brave mettle; you would\nlift the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue in it\nfive weeks without changing.                                       175\n\n\n  _Enter ARIEL (invisible) playing solemn music._\n\n_Seb._ We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.\n\n_Ant._ Nay, good my lord, be not angry.\n\n_Gon._ No, I warrant you; I will not adventure my discretion\nso weakly.

I find not\nMyself disposed to sleep.\n\n_Ant._                  Nor I; my spirits are nimble.\nThey fell together all, as by consent;\nThey dropp\x92d, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,                  195\nWorthy Sebastian?--O, what might?--No more:--\nAnd yet methinks I see it in thy face,\nWhat thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee; and\nMy strong imagination sees a crown\nDropping upon thy head.\n\n_Seb._                What, art thou waking?                       200\n\n_Ant._ Do you not hear me speak?\n\n_Seb._                         I do; and surely\nIt is a sleepy language, and thou speak\x92st\nOut of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?\nThis is a strange repose, to be asleep\nWith eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,                   205\nAnd yet so fast asleep.\n\n_Ant._                Noble Sebastian,\nThou let\x92st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink\x92st\nWhiles thou art waking.\n\n_Seb._                Thou dost snore distinctly;\nThere\x92s meaning in thy snores.\n\n_Ant._ I am more serious than my custom: you                       210\nMust be so too, if heed me; which to do\nTrebles thee o\x92er.\n\n_Seb._           Well, I am standing water.\n\n_Ant._ I\x92ll teach you how to flow.\n\n_Seb._                           Do so: to ebb\nHereditary sloth instructs me.\n\n_Ant._                       O,\nIf you but knew how you the purpose cherish                        215\nWhiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,\nYou more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,\nMost often do so near the bottom run\nBy their own fear or sloth.\n\n_Seb._                    Prithee, say on:\nThe setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim                        220\nA matter from thee; and a birth, indeed,\nWhich throes thee much to yield.\n\n_Ant._                         Thus, sir:\nAlthough this lord of weak remembrance, this,\nWho shall be of as little memory\nWhen he is earth\x92d, hath here almost persuaded,--                  225\nFor he\x92s a spirit of persuasion, only\nProfesses to persuade,--the king his son\x92s alive,\n\x92Tis as impossible that he\x92s undrown\x92d\nAs he that sleeps here swims.\n\n_Seb._                      I have no hope\nThat he\x92s undrown\x92d.\n\n_Ant._             O, out of that \x91no hope\x92                        230\nWhat great hope have you! no hope that way is\nAnother way so high a hope that even\nAmbition cannot pierce a wink beyond,\nBut doubt discovery there.

How say you?          245\n\x92Tis true, my brother\x92s daughter\x92s queen of Tunis;\nSo is she heir of Naples; \x92twixt which regions\nThere is some space.\n\n_Ant._             A space whose every cubit\nSeems to cry out, \x93How shall that Claribel\nMeasure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,                          250\nAnd let Sebastian wake.\x94 Say, this were death\nThat now hath seized them; why, they were no worse\nThan now they are. There be that can rule Naples\nAs well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate\nAs amply and unnecessarily                                         255\nAs this Gonzalo; I myself could make\nA chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore\nThe mind that I do! what a sleep were this\nFor your advancement! Do you understand me?\n\n_Seb._ Methinks I do.\n\n_Ant._              And how does your content                      260\nTender your own good fortune?\n\n_Seb._                      I remember\nYou did supplant your brother Prospero.\n\n_Ant._                                True:\nAnd look how well my garments sit upon me;\nMuch feater than before: my brother\x92s servants\nWere then my fellows; now they are my men.                         265\n\n_Seb._ But for your conscience.\n\n_Ant._ Ay, sir; where lies that? if \x92twere a kibe,\n\x92Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not\nThis deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,\nThat stand \x92twixt me and Milan, candied be they,                   270\nAnd melt, ere they molest! Here lies your brother,\nNo better than the earth he lies upon,\nIf he were that which now he\x92s like, that\x92s dead;\nWhom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,\nCan lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,                   275\nTo the perpetual wink for aye might put\nThis ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who\nShould not upbraid our course. For all the rest,\nThey\x92ll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;\nThey\x92ll tell the clock to any business that                        280\nWe say befits the hour.\n\n_Seb._                Thy case, dear friend,\nShall be my precedent; as thou got\x92st Milan,\nI\x92ll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke\nShall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;\nAnd I the king shall love thee.\n\n_Ant._                        Draw together;                       285\nAnd when I rear my hand, do you the like,\nTo fall it on Gonzalo.\n\n_Seb._               O, but one word.      [_They talk apart._\n\n  _Re-enter ARIEL invisible._\n\n_Ari._ My master through his art foresees the danger\nThat you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth,--\nFor else his project dies,--to keep them living.                   290\n                            [_Sings in Gonzalo\x92s ear._\n\nWhile you here do snoring lie,\nOpen-eyed conspiracy\n    His time doth take.\nIf of life you keep a care,\nShake off slumber, and beware:                                     295\n    Awake, awake!\n\n_Ant._ Then let us both be sudden.\n\n_Gon._                           Now, good angels\nPreserve the king!

I\x92ll fall flat;\nPerchance he will not mind me.\n\n_Trin._ Here\x92s neither bush nor shrub, to bear off any\nweather at all, and another storm brewing; I hear it sing i\x92\nthe wind: yond same black cloud, yond huge one, looks               20\nlike a foul bombard that would shed his liquor. If it should\nthunder as it did before, I know not where to hide my head:\nyond same cloud cannot choose but fall by pailfuls. What\nhave we here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish: he\nsmells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-like smell; a kind      25\nof not of the newest Poor-John. A strange fish! Were I\nin England now, as once I was, and had but this fish\npainted, not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of\nsilver: there would this monster make a man; any strange\nbeast there makes a man: when they will not give a doit to          30\nrelieve a lame beggar, they will lay out ten to see a dead\nIndian. Legged like a man! and his fins like arms! Warm\no\x92 my troth! I do now let loose my opinion; hold it no\nlonger: this is no fish, but an islander, that hath lately\nsuffered by a thunderbolt. [_Thunder._] Alas, the storm is come     35\nagain! my best way is to creep under his gaberdine; there\nis no other shelter hereabout: misery acquaints a man with\nstrange bed-fellows.

[_Drinks._\n\n\n[_Sings._ The master, the swabber, the boatswain, and I,\n                       The gunner, and his mate,                    45\n               Loved Mall, Meg, and Marian, and Margery,\n                   But none of us cared for Kate;\n                   For she had a tongue with a tang,\n                   Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!\n               She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch;        50\n               Yet a tailor might scratch her where\x92er she did itch.\n                   Then, to sea, boys, and let her go hang!\n\nThis is a scurvy tune too: but here\x92s my comfort.

I\nhave not scaped drowning, to be afeard now of your four\nlegs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as ever went\non four legs cannot make him give ground; and it shall be\nsaid so again, while Stephano breathes at\x92s nostrils.               60\n\n_Cal._ The spirit torments me:--O!\n\n_Ste._ This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who\nhath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil should he\nlearn our language? I will give him some relief, if it be\nbut for that. If I can recover him, and keep him tame, and          65\nget to Naples with him, he\x92s a present for any emperor that\never trod on neat\x92s-leather.\n\n_Cal._ Do not torment me, prithee; I\x92ll bring my wood\nhome faster.\n\n_Ste._ He\x92s in his fit now, and does not talk after the             70\nwisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have never drunk\nwine afore, it will go near to remove his fit. If I can recover\nhim, and keep him tame, I will not take too much for\nhim; he shall pay for him that hath him, and that soundly.\n\n_Cal._ Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I          75\nknow it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.\n\n_Ste._ Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that\nwhich will give language to you, cat: open your mouth; this\nwill shake your shaking, I can tell you, and that soundly:\nyou cannot tell who\x92s your friend: open your chaps again.           80\n\n_Trin._ I should know that voice: it should be--but he\nis drowned; and these are devils:--O defend me!\n\n_Ste._ Four legs and two voices,--a most delicate monster!\nHis forward voice, now, is to speak well of his friend;\nhis backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract.        85\nIf all the wine in my bottle will recover him, I will help\nhis ague. Come:--Amen! I will pour some in thy other\nmouth.\n\n_Trin._ Stephano!\n\n_Ste._ Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy!                  90\nThis is a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have\nno long spoon.\n\n_Trin._ Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me,\nand speak to me; for I am Trinculo,--be not afeard,--thy\ngood friend Trinculo.                                               95\n\n_Ste._ If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I\x92ll pull thee\nby the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo\x92s legs, these are they.\nThou art very Trinculo indeed! How earnest thou to be\nthe siege of this moon-calf? can he vent Trinculos?\n\n_Trin._ I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke.             100\nBut art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope, now, thou\nart not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me\nunder the dead moon-calf\x92s gaberdine for fear of the storm.\nAnd art thou living, Stephano?

I escaped\nupon a butt of sack, which the sailors heaved o\x92erboard, by\nthis bottle! which I made of the bark of a tree with mine\nown hands, since I was cast ashore.                                115\n\n_Cal._ I\x92ll swear, upon that bottle, to be thy true subject;\nfor the liquor is not earthly.\n\n_Ste._ Here; swear, then, how thou escapedst.\n\n_Trin._ Swum ashore, man, like a duck: I can swim\nlike a duck, I\x92ll be sworn.                                        120\n\n_Ste._ Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim\nlike a duck, thou art made like a goose.\n\n_Trin._ O Stephano, hast any more of this?\n\n_Ste._ The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by\nthe sea-side, where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!            125\nhow does thine ague?\n\n_Cal._ Hast thou not dropp\x92d from heaven?\n\n_Ste._ Out o\x92 the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man\ni\x92 the moon when time was.\n\n_Cal._ I have seen thee in her, and I do adore thee:               130\nMy mistress show\x92d me thee, and thy dog, and thy bush.\n\n_Ste._ Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish\nit anon with new contents: swear.\n\n_Trin._ By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!\nI afeard of him! A very weak monster! The                          135\nman i\x92 the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well\ndrawn, monster, in good sooth!\n\n_Cal._ I\x92ll show thee every fertile inch o\x92 th\x92 island;\nAnd I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.\n\n_Trin._ By this light, a most perfidious and drunken               140\nmonster! when\x92s god\x92s asleep, he\x92ll rob his bottle.\n\n_Cal._ I\x92ll kiss thy foot; I\x92ll swear myself thy subject.\n\n_Ste._ Come on, then; down, and swear.\n\n_Trin._ I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed\nmonster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in                    145\nmy heart to beat him,--\n\n_Ste._ Come, kiss.\n\n_Trin._ But that the poor monster\x92s in drink: an abominable\nmonster!\n\n_Cal._ I\x92ll show thee the best springs; I\x92ll pluck thee berries;   150\nI\x92ll fish for thee, and get thee wood enough.\nA plague upon the tyrant that I serve!\nI\x92ll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,\nThou wondrous man.\n\n_Trin._ A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder                155\nof a poor drunkard!\n\n_Cal._ I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;\nAnd I with my long nails will dig thee pig-nuts;\nShow thee a jay\x92s nest, and instruct thee how\nTo snare the nimble marmoset; I\x92ll bring thee                      160\nTo clustering filberts, and sometimes I\x92ll get thee\nYoung scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?\n\n_Ste._ I prithee now, lead the way, without any more\ntalking. Trinculo, the king and all our company else being\ndrowned, we will inherit here: here; bear my bottle: fellow        165\nTrinculo, we\x92ll fill him by and by again.\n\n_Cal. sings drunkenly._] Farewell, master; farewell, farewell!\n\n_Trin._ A howling monster; a drunken monster!\n\n_Cal._ No more dams I\x92ll make for fish;\n                Nor fetch in firing                                170\n                At requiring;\n             Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish:\n                \x92Ban, \x92Ban, Cacaliban\n                Has a new master:--get a new man.\n\nFreedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom, hey-day,              175\nfreedom!\n\n_Ste._ O brave monster!

This my mean task\nWould be as heavy to me as odious, but                               5\nThe mistress which I serve quickens what\x92s dead,\nAnd makes my labours pleasures: O, she is\nTen times more gentle than her father\x92s crabbed.\nAnd he\x92s composed of harshness. I must remove\nSome thousands of these logs, and pile them up,                     10\nUpon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress\nWeeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness\nHad never like executor. I forget:\nBut these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,\nMost busy lest, when I do it.\n\n  _Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen._\n\n_Mir._                  Alas, now, pray you,                        15\nWork not so hard: I would the lightning had\nBurnt up those logs that you are enjoin\x92d to pile!\nPray, set it down, and rest you: when this burns,\n\x92Twill weep for having wearied you. My father\nIs hard at study; pray, now, rest yourself;                         20\nHe\x92s safe for these three hours.\n\n_Fer._                         O most dear mistress,\nThe sun will set before I shall discharge\nWhat I must strive to do.\n\n_Mir._                  If you\x92ll sit down,\nI\x92ll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;\nI\x92ll carry it to the pile.\n\n_Fer._                   No, precious creature;                     25\nI had rather crack my sinews, break my back,\nThan you should such dishonour undergo,\nWhile I sit lazy by.\n\n_Mir._             It would become me\nAs well as it does you: and I should do it\nWith much more ease; for my good will is to it,                     30\nAnd yours it is against.\n\n_Pros._                Poor worm, thou art infected!\nThis visitation shows it.\n\n_Mir._                  You look wearily.\n\n_Fer._ No, noble mistress; \x92tis fresh morning with me\nWhen you are by at night. I do beseech you,--\nChiefly that I might set it in my prayers,--                        35\nWhat is your name?\n\n_Mir._           Miranda. --O my father,\nI have broke your hest to say so!\n\n_Fer._                          Admired Miranda!\nIndeed the top of admiration! worth\nWhat\x92s dearest to the world! Full many a lady\nI have eyed with best regard, and many a time                       40\nThe harmony of their tongues hath into bondage\nBrought my too diligent ear: for several virtues\nHave I liked several women; never any\nWith so full soul, but some defect in her\nDid quarrel with the noblest grace she owed,                        45\nAnd put it to the foil: but you, O you,\nSo perfect and so peerless, are created\nOf every creature\x92s best!\n\n_Mir._             I do not know\nOne of my sex; no woman\x92s face remember,\nSave, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen                      50\nMore that I may call men than you, good friend,\nAnd my dear father: how features are abroad,\nI am skilless of; but, by my modesty,\nThe jewel in my dower, I would not wish\nAny companion in the world but you;                                 55\nNor can imagination form a shape,\nBesides yourself, to like of. But I prattle\nSomething too wildly, and my father\x92s precepts\nI therein do forget.\n\n_Fer._             I am, in my condition,\nA prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;                              60\nI would, not so!--and would no more endure\nThis wooden slavery than to suffer\nThe flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:\nThe very instant that I saw you, did\nMy heart fly to your service; there resides,                        65\nTo make me slave to it; and for your sake\nAm I this patient log-man.\n\n_Mir._                   Do you love me?\n\n_Fer._ O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound,\nAnd crown what I profess with kind event,\nIf I speak true! if hollowly, invert                                70\nWhat best is boded me to mischief! I,\nBeyond all limit of what else i\x92 the world,\nDo love, prize, honour you.\n\n_Mir._                    I am a fool\nTo weep at what I am glad of.\n\n_Pros._                     Fair encounter\nOf two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace                     75\nOn that which breeds between \x92em!\n\n_Fer._                          Wherefore weep you?\n\n_Mir._ At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer\nWhat I desire to give; and much less take\nWhat I shall die to want. But this is trifling;\nAnd all the more it seeks to hide itself,                           80\nThe bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!\nAnd prompt me, plain and holy innocence!\nI am your wife, if you will marry me;\nIf not, I\x92ll die your maid: to be your fellow\nYou may deny me; but I\x92ll be your servant,                          85\nWhether you will or no.\n\n_Fer._                My mistress, dearest;\nAnd I thus humble ever.\n\n_Mir._                My husband, then?\n\n_Fer._ Ay, with a heart as willing\nAs bondage e\x92er of freedom: here\x92s my hand.\n\n_Mir._ And mine, with my heart in\x92t: and now farewell               90\nTill half an hour hence.\n\n_Fer._                 A thousand thousand!\n\n    [_Exeunt Fer. and Mir. severally._\n\n_Pros._ So glad of this as they I cannot be,\nWho are surprised withal; but my rejoicing\nAt nothing can be more. I\x92ll to my book;\nFor yet, ere supper-time, must I perform                            95\nMuch business appertaining.

They\nsay there\x92s but five upon this isle: we are three of them; if        5\nth\x92 other two be brained like us, the state totters.\n\n_Ste._ Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes\nare almost set in thy head.\n\n_Trin._ Where should they be set else? he were a brave\nmonster indeed, if they were set in his tail.                       10\n\n_Ste._ My man-monster hath drowned his tongue in sack:\nfor my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I could\nrecover the shore, five-and-thirty leagues off and on. By\nthis light, thou shalt be my lieutenant, monster, or my\nstandard.                                                           15\n\n_Trin._ Your lieutenant, if you list; he\x92s no standard.\n\n_Ste._ We\x92ll not run, Monsieur Monster.\n\n_Trin._ Nor go neither; but you\x92ll lie, like dogs, and\nyet say nothing neither.\n\n_Ste._ Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a           20\ngood moon-calf.\n\n_Cal._ How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.\nI\x92ll not serve him, he is not valiant.\n\n_Trin._ Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case\nto justle a constable. Why, thou debauched fish, thou, was          25\nthere ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as\nI to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie, being but half a\nfish and half a monster?\n\n_Cal._ Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?\n\n_Trin._ \x91Lord,\x92 quoth he! That a monster should be                  30\nsuch a natural!\n\n_Cal._ Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.\n\n_Ste._ Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you\nprove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster\x92s my\nsubject, and he shall not suffer indignity.                         35\n\n_Cal._ I thank my noble lord.

Proceed.\n\n_Cal._ I say, by sorcery he got this isle;\nFrom me he got it. If thy greatness will                            50\nRevenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,\nBut this thing dare not,--\n\n_Ste._ That\x92s most certain.\n\n_Cal._ Thou shalt be lord of it, and I\x92ll serve thee.\n\n_Ste._ How now shall this be compassed? Canst thou                  55\nbring me to the party?\n\n_Cal._ Yea, yea, my lord: I\x92ll yield him thee asleep,\nWhere thou mayst knock a nail into his head.\n\n_Ari._ Thou liest; thou canst not.\n\n_Cal._ What a pied ninny\x92s this! Thou scurvy patch!                 60\nI do beseech thy Greatness, give him blows,\nAnd take his bottle from him: when that\x92s gone,\nHe shall drink nought but brine; for I\x92ll not show him\nWhere the quick freshes are.\n\n_Ste._ Trinculo, run into no further danger: interrupt the          65\nmonster one word further, and, by this hand, I\x92ll turn my\nmercy out o\x92 doors, and make a stock-fish of thee.\n\n_Trin._ Why, what did I? I did nothing. I\x92ll go farther\noff.\n\n_Ste._ Didst thou not say he lied?                                  70\n\n_Ari._ Thou liest.\n\n_Ste._ Do I so? take thou that. [_Beats him._] As you\nlike this, give me the lie another time.\n\n_Trin._ I did not give the lie. Out o\x92 your wits, and\nhearing too? A pox o\x92 your bottle! this can sack and                75\ndrinking do. A murrain on your monster, and the devil\ntake your fingers!\n\n_Cal._ Ha, ha, ha!\n\n_Ste._ Now, forward with your tale. --Prithee, stand farther\noff.                                                                80\n\n_Cal._ Beat him enough: after a little time,\nI\x92ll beat him too.\n\n_Ste._ Stand farther. Come, proceed.\n\n_Cal._ Why, as I told thee, \x92tis a custom with him\nI\x92 th\x92 afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,\nHaving first seized his books; or with a log                        85\nBatter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,\nOr cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember\nFirst to possess his books; for without them\nHe\x92s but a sot, as I am, nor hath not\nOne spirit to command: they all do hate him                         90\nAs rootedly as I. Burn but his books.\nHe has brave utensils,--for so he calls them,--\nWhich, when he has a house, he\x92ll deck withal.\nAnd that most deeply to consider is\nThe beauty of his daughter; he himself                              95\nCalls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,\nBut only Sycorax my dam and she;\nBut she as far surpasseth Sycorax\nAs great\x92st does least.\n\n_Ste._                Is it so brave a lass?\n\n_Cal._ Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant,               100\nAnd bring thee forth brave brood.\n\n_Ste._ Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I\nwill be king and queen,--save our Graces!--and Trinculo\nand thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou like the plot,\nTrinculo?                                                          105\n\n_Trin._ Excellent.\n\n_Ste._ Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,\nwhile thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.\n\n_Cal._ Within this half hour will he be asleep:\nWilt thou destroy him then?\n\n_Ste._                    Ay, on mine honour.                      110\n\n_Ari._ This will I tell my master.\n\n_Cal._ Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:\nLet us be jocund: will you troll the catch\nYou taught me but while-ere?\n\n_Ste._ At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any              115\nreason. --Come on.

By your patience,\nI needs must rest me.\n\n_Alon._             Old lord, I cannot blame thee,\nWho am myself attach\x92d with weariness,                               5\nTo the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.\nEven here I will put off my hope, and keep it\nNo longer for my flatterer: he is drown\x92d\nWhom thus we stray to find; and the sea mocks\nOur frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.                     10\n\n_Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] I am right glad that he\x92s so out of hope.\nDo not, for one repulse, forego the purpose\nThat you resolved to effect.\n\n_Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] The next advantage\nWill we take throughly.\n\n_Ant._ [_Aside to Seb._] Let it be to-night;\nFor, now they are oppress\x92d with travel, they                       15\nWill not, nor cannot, use such vigilance\nAs when they are fresh.\n\n_Seb._ [_Aside to Ant._] I say, to-night: no more.\n\n  [_Solemn and strange music._\n\n_Alon._ What harmony is this?--My good friends, hark!\n\n_Gon._ Marvellous sweet music!\n\n  _Enter PROSPERO above, invisible.

Now I will believe\nThat there are unicorns; that in Arabia\nThere is one tree, the ph\x9cnix\x92 throne; one ph\x9cnix\nAt this hour reigning there.\n\n_Ant._                     I\x92ll believe both;\nAnd what does else want credit, come to me,                         25\nAnd I\x92ll be sworn \x92tis true: travellers ne\x92er did lie,\nThough fools at home condemn \x92em.\n\n_Gon._                          If in Naples\nI should report this now, would they believe me?\nIf I should say, I saw such islanders,--\nFor, certes, these are people of the island,--                      30\nWho, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,\nTheir manners are more gentle-kind than of\nOur human generation you shall find\nMany, nay, almost any.\n\n_Pros._              [_Aside_] Honest lord,\nThou hast said well; for some of you there present                  35\nAre worse than devils.\n\n_Alon._              I cannot too much muse\nSuch shapes, such gesture, and such sound, expressing--\nAlthough they want the use of tongue--a kind\nOf excellent dumb discourse.\n\n_Pros._                    [_Aside_] Praise in departing.\n\n_Fran._ They vanish\x92d strangely.\n\n_Seb._                         No matter, since                     40\nThey have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.--\nWill\x92t please you taste of what is here?\n\n_Alon._                                Not I.\n\n_Gon._ Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,\nWho would believe that there were mountaineers\nDew-lapp\x92d like bulls, whose throats had hanging at \x92em             45\nWallets of flesh? or that there were such men\nWhose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find\nEach putter-out of five for one will bring us\nGood warrant of.\n\n_Alon._        I will stand to, and feed,\nAlthough my last: no matter, since I feel                           50\nThe best is past.

I have made you mad;\nAnd even with such-like valour men hang and drown\nTheir proper selves.    [_Alon., Seb. &c. draw their swords._\n                   You fools! I and my fellows                      60\nAre ministers of Fate: the elements,\nOf whom your swords are temper\x92d, may as well\nWound the loud winds, or with bemock\x92d-at stabs\nKill the still-closing waters, as diminish\nOne dowle that\x92s in my plume: my fellow-ministers                   65\nAre like invulnerable. If you could hurt,\nYour swords are now too massy for your strengths,\nAnd will not be uplifted. But remember,--\nFor that\x92s my business to you,--that you three\nFrom Milan did supplant good Prospero;                              70\nExposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,\nHim and his innocent child: for which foul deed\nThe powers, delaying, not forgetting, have\nIncensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,\nAgainst your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,                        75\nThey have bereft; and do pronounce by me:\nLingering perdition--worse than any death\nCan be at once--shall step by step attend\nYou and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from,--\nWhich here, in this most desolate isle, else falls                  80\nUpon your heads,--is nothing but heart-sorrow\nAnd a clear life ensuing.\n\n  _He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music, enter the Shapes\n  again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the\n  table._\n\n_Pros._ Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou\nPerform\x92d, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:\nOf my instruction hast thou nothing bated                           85\nIn what thou hadst to say: so, with good life\nAnd observation strange, my meaner ministers\nTheir several kinds have done. My high charms work,\nAnd these mine enemies are all knit up\nIn their distractions: they now are in my power;                    90\nAnd in these fits I leave them, while I visit\nYoung Ferdinand,--whom they suppose is drown\x92d,--\nAnd his and mine loved darling.    [_Exit above._\n\n_Gon._ I\x92 the name of something holy, sir, why stand you\nIn this strange stare?\n\n_Alon._              O, it is monstrous, monstrous!                 95\nMethought the billows spoke, and told me of it;\nThe winds did sing it to me; and the thunder,\nThat deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced\nThe name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.\nTherefore my son i\x92 th\x92 ooze is bedded; and                        100\nI\x92ll seek him deeper than e\x92er plummet sounded,\nAnd with him there lie mudded.

I do beseech you,\nThat are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly,\nAnd hinder them from what this ecstasy\nMay now provoke them to.\n\n_Adr._                 Follow, I pray you.

Here thought they to have done\n    Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,                       95\n    Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid\n    Till Hymen\x92s torch be lighted: but in vain;\n    Mars\x92s hot minion is returned again;\n    Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,\n    Swears he will shoot no more, but play with sparrows,          100\n    And be a boy right out.\n\n  _Cer._                High\x92st queen of state,\n    Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.\n\n    _Enter JUNO._\n\n  _Juno._ How does my bounteous sister?

Then I beat my tabor;                       175\nAt which, like unback\x92d colts, they prick\x92d their ears,\nAdvanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses\nAs they smelt music: so I charm\x92d their ears,\nThat, calf-like, they my lowing follow\x92d through\nTooth\x92d briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss, and thorns,           180\nWhich enter\x92d their frail shins: at last I left them\nI\x92 the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,\nThere dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake\nO\x92erstunk their feet.\n\n_Pros._             This was well done, my bird.\nThy shape invisible retain thou still:                             185\nThe trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,\nFor stale to catch these thieves.\n\n_Ari._                          I go, I go.

Do you hear, monster? If I should               200\ntake a displeasure against you, look you,--\n\n_Trin._ Thou wert but a lost monster.\n\n_Cal._ Good my lord, give me thy favour still.\nBe patient, for the prize I\x92ll bring thee to\nShall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.             205\nAll\x92s hush\x92d as midnight yet.\n\n_Trin._ Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--\n\n_Ste._ There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,\nmonster, but an infinite loss.\n\n_Trin._ That\x92s more to me than my wetting: yet this is             210\nyour harmless fairy, monster.\n\n_Ste._ I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o\x92er ears for\nmy labour.\n\n_Cal._ Prithee, my king, be quiet. See\x92st thou here,\nThis is the mouth o\x92 the cell: no noise, and enter.                215\nDo that good mischief which may make this island\nThine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,\nFor aye thy foot-licker.\n\n_Ste._ Give me thy hand.

Now is the jerkin under the line: now, jerkin,          235\nyou are like to lose your hair, and prove a bald jerkin.\n\n_Trin._ Do, do: we steal by line and level, an\x92t like your\nGrace.\n\n_Ste._ I thank thee for that jest; here\x92s a garment for\x92t:\nwit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this country.       240\n\x91Steal by line and level\x92 is an excellent pass of pate;\nthere\x92s another garment for\x92t.\n\n_Trin._ Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers,\nand away with the rest.\n\n_Cal._ I will have none on\x92t: we shall lose our time,              245\nAnd all be turn\x92d to barnacles, or to apes\nWith foreheads villanous low.\n\n_Ste._ Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this\naway where my hogshead of wine is, or I\x92ll turn you out\nof my kingdom: go to, carry this.                                  250\n\n_Trin._ And this.\n\n_Ste._ Ay, and this.\n\n  _A noise of hunters heard.

How\x92s the day?\n\n_Ari._ On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,\nYou said our work should cease.\n\n_Pros._                       I did say so,                          5\nWhen first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,\nHow fares the king and\x92s followers?\n\n_Ari._                            Confined together\nIn the same fashion as you gave in charge,\nJust as you left them; all prisoners, sir,\nIn the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;                    10\nThey cannot budge till your release. The king,\nHis brother, and yours, abide all three distracted,\nAnd the remainder mourning over them,\nBrimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly\nHim that you term\x92d, sir, \x93The good old lord, Gonzalo;\x94             15\nHis tears run down his beard, like winter\x92s drops\nFrom eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works \x92em,\nThat if you now beheld them, your affections\nWould become tender.\n\n_Pros._            Dost thou think so, spirit?\n\n_Ari._ Mine would, sir, were I human.\n\n_Pros._                             And mine shall.                 20\nHast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling\nOf their afflictions, and shall not myself,\nOne of their kind, that relish all as sharply,\nPassion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?\nThough with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,             25\nYet with my nobler reason \x92gainst my fury\nDo I take part: the rarer action is\nIn virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,\nThe sole drift of my purpose doth extend\nNot a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:                        30\nMy charms I\x92ll break, their senses I\x92ll restore,\nAnd they shall be themselves.\n\n_Ari._                      I\x92ll fetch them, sir.    [_Exit._\n\n_Pros._ Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes, and groves;\nAnd ye that on the sands with printless foot\nDo chase the ebbing Neptune, and do fly him                         35\nWhen he comes back; you demi-puppets that\nBy moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,\nWhereof the ewe not bites; and you whose pastime\nIs to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice\nTo hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid--                           40\nWeak masters though ye be--I have bedimm\x92d\nThe noontide sun, call\x92d forth the mutinous winds.\nAnd \x92twixt the green sea and the azured vault\nSet roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder\nHave I given fire, and rifted Jove\x92s stout oak                      45\nWith his own bolt; the strong-based promontory\nHave I made shake, and by the spurs pluck\x92d up\nThe pine and cedar: graves at my command\nHave waked their sleepers, oped, and let \x92em forth\nBy my so potent art. But this rough magic                           50\nI here abjure; and, when I have required\nSome heavenly music,--which even now I do,--\nTo work mine end upon their senses, that\nThis airy charm is for, I\x92ll break my staff,\nBury it certain fathoms in the earth,                               55\nAnd deeper than did ever plummet sound\nI\x92ll drown my book.                    [_Solemn music._\n\n  _Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture,\n  attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,\n  attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO: they all enter the circle\n  which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO\n  observing, speaks:_\n\nA solemn air, and the best comforter\nTo an unsettled fancy, cure thy brains,\nNow useless, boil\x92d within thy skull! There stand,                  60\nFor you are spell-stopp\x92d.\nHoly Gonzalo, honourable man,\nMine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,\nFall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace;\nAnd as the morning steals upon the night,                           65\nMelting the darkness, so their rising senses\nBegin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle\nTheir clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,\nMy true preserver, and a loyal sir\nTo him thou follow\x92st! I will pay thy graces                        70\nHome both in word and deed. Most cruelly\nDidst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:\nThy brother was a furtherer in the act.\nThou art pinch\x92d for\x92t now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,\nYou, brother mine, that entertain\x92d ambition,                       75\nExpell\x92d remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,--\nWhose inward pinches therefore are most strong,--\nWould here have kill\x92d your king; I do forgive thee,\nUnnatural though thou art. Their understanding\nBegins to swell; and the approaching tide                           80\nWill shortly fill the reasonable shore,\nThat now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them\nThat yet looks on me, or would know me: Ariel,\nFetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:\nI will discase me, and myself present                               85\nAs I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;\nThou shalt ere long be free.\n\n_ARIEL sings and helps to attire him._\n\n    Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\n    In a cowslip\x92s bell I lie;\n    There I couch when owls do cry.                                 90\n    On the bat\x92s back I do fly\n    After summer merrily.\nMerrily, merrily shall I live now\nUnder the blossom that hangs on the bough.\n\n_Pros._ Why, that\x92s my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee;             95\nBut yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.\nTo the king\x92s ship, invisible as thou art:\nThere shalt thou find the mariners asleep\nUnder the hatches; the master and the boatswain\nBeing awake, enforce them to this place,                           100\nAnd presently, I prithee.\n\n_Ari._ I drink the air before me, and return\nOr ere your pulse twice beat.    [_Exit._\n\n_Gon._ All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement\nInhabits here: some heavenly power guide us                        105\nOut of this fearful country!\n\n_Pros._                    Behold, sir king,\nThe wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:\nFor more assurance that a living prince\nDoes now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;\nAnd to thee and thy company I bid                                  110\nA hearty welcome.\n\n_Alon._         Whether thou be\x92st he or no,\nOr some enchanted trifle to abuse me,\nAs late I have been, I not know: thy pulse\nBeats, as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,\nThe affliction of my mind amends, with which,                      115\nI fear, a madness held me: this must crave--\nAn if this be at all--a most strange story.\nThy dukedom I resign, and do entreat\nThou pardon me my wrongs. --But how should Prospero\nBe living and be here?\n\n_Pros._              First, noble friend,                          120\nLet me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot\nBe measured or confined.\n\n_Gon._                 Whether this be\nOr be not, I\x92ll not swear.\n\n_Pros._                  You do yet taste\nSome subtilties o\x92 the isle, that will not let you\nBelieve things certain. Welcome, my friends all!                   125\n[_Aside to Seb. and Ant._]\n    But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,\nI here could pluck his Highness\x92 frown upon you,\nAnd justify you traitors: at this time\nI will tell no tales.\n\n_Seb._ [_Aside_]    The devil speaks in him.\n\n_Pros._                                    No.\nFor you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother                     130\nWould even infect my mouth, I do forgive\nThy rankest fault,--all of them; and require\nMy dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,\nThou must restore.\n\n_Alon._          If thou be\x92st Prospero,\nGive us particulars of thy preservation;                           135\nHow thou hast met us here, who three hours since\nWere wreck\x92d upon this shore; where I have lost--\nHow sharp the point of this remembrance is!--\nMy dear son Ferdinand.\n\n_Pros._              I am woe for\x92t, sir.\n\n_Alon._ Irreparable is the loss; and patience                      140\nSays it is past her cure.\n\n_Pros._                 I rather think\nYou have not sought her help, of whose soft grace\nFor the like loss I have her sovereign aid,\nAnd rest myself content.\n\n_Alon._                You the like loss!\n\n_Pros._ As great to me as late; and, supportable                   145\nTo make the dear loss, have I means much weaker\nThan you may call to comfort you, for I\nHave lost my daughter.\n\n_Alon._              A daughter?\nO heavens, that they were living both in Naples,\nThe king and queen there! that they were, I wish                   150\nMyself were mudded in that oozy bed\nWhere my son lies. When did you lose you daughter?\n\n_Pros._ In this last tempest. I perceive, these lords\nAt this encounter do so much admire,\nThat they devour their reason, and scarce think                    155\nTheir eyes do offices of truth, their words\nAre natural breath: but, howsoe\x92er you have\nBeen justled from your senses, know for certain\nThat I am Prospero, and that very duke\nWhich was thrust forth of Milan; who most strangely                160\nUpon this shore, where you were wreck\x92d, was landed,\nTo be the Lord on\x92t. No more yet of this;\nFor \x92tis a chronicle of day by day,\nNot a relation for a breakfast, nor\nBefitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;                        165\nThis cell\x92s my court: here have I few attendants,\nAnd subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.\nMy dukedom since you have given me again,\nI will requite you with as good a thing;\nAt least bring forth a wonder, to content ye                       170\nAs much as me my dukedom.\n\n  _Here Prospero discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess._\n\n_Mir._ Sweet lord, you play me false.\n\n_Fer._                              No, my dear\x92st love,\nI would not for the world.\n\n_Mir._ Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,\nAnd I would call it fair play.\n\n_Alon._                      If this prove                         175\nA vision of the island, one dear son\nShall I twice lose.\n\n_Seb._            A most high miracle!\n\n_Fer._ Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;\nI have cursed them without cause.               [_Kneels._\n\n_Alon._                          Now all the blessings\nOf a glad father compass thee about!                               180\nArise, and say how thou camest here.\n\n_Mir._                             O, wonder!\nHow many goodly creatures are there here!\nHow beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,\nThat has such people in\x92t!\n\n_Pros._                  \x92Tis new to thee.\n\n_Alon._ What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?             185\nYour eld\x92st acquaintance cannot be three hours:\nIs she the goddess that hath sever\x92d us,\nAnd brought us thus together?\n\n_Fer._                      Sir, she is mortal;\nBut by immortal Providence she\x92s mine:\nI chose her when I could not ask my father                         190\nFor his advice, nor thought I had one. She\nIs daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,\nOf whom so often I have heard renown,\nBut never saw before; of whom I have\nReceived a second life; and second father                          195\nThis lady makes him to me.\n\n_Alon._                  I am hers:\nBut, O, how oddly will it sound that I\nMust ask my child forgiveness!\n\n_Pros._                      There, sir, stop:\nLet us not burthen our remembrances with\nA heaviness that\x92s gone.\n\n_Gon._                 I have inly wept,                           200\nOr should have spoke ere this. Look down, you gods,\nAnd on this couple drop a blessed crown!\nFor it is you that have chalk\x92d forth the way\nWhich brought us hither.\n\n_Alon._                I say, Amen, Gonzalo!\n\n_Gon._ Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue                 205\nShould become kings of Naples? O, rejoice\nBeyond a common joy! and set it down\nWith gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage\nDid Claribel her husband find at Tunis,\nAnd Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife                           210\nWhere he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom\nIn a poor isle, and all of us ourselves\nWhen no man was his own.\n\n_Alon._ [_to Fer. and Mir._] Give me your hands:\nLet grief and sorrow still embrace his heart\nThat doth not wish you joy!\n\n_Gon._                    Be it so! Amen!                          215\n\n  _Re-enter ARIEL, with the _Master_ and _Boatswain_ amazedly\n  following._\n\nO, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:\nI prophesied, if a gallows were on land,\nThis fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,\nThat swear\x92st grace o\x92erboard, not an oath on shore?\nHast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?                      220\n\n_Boats._ The best news is, that we have safely found\nOur king and company; the next, our ship--\nWhich, but three glasses since, we gave out split--\nIs tight and yare and bravely rigg\x92d, as when\nWe first put out to sea.\n\n_Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Sir, all this service                    225\nHave I done since I went.\n\n_Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] My tricksy spirit!\n\n_Alon._ These are not natural events; they strengthen\nFrom strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?\n\n_Boats._ If I did think, sir, I were well awake,\nI\x92ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,                    230\nAnd--how we know not--all clapp\x92d under hatches;\nWhere, but even now, with strange and several noises\nOf roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,\nAnd more diversity of sounds, all horrible,\nWe were awaked; straightway, at liberty;                           235\nWhere we, in all her trim, freshly beheld\nOur royal, good, and gallant ship; our master\nCapering to eye her:--on a trice, so please you,\nEven in a dream, were we divided from them,\nAnd were brought moping hither.\n\n_Ari._ [_Aside to Pros._] Was\x92t well done?                         240\n\n_Pros._ [_Aside to Ari._] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.\n\n_Alon._ This is as strange a maze as e\x92er men trod;\nAnd there is in this business more than nature\nWas ever conduct of: some oracle\nMust rectify our knowledge.\n\n_Pros._                   Sir, my liege,                           245\nDo not infest your mind with beating on\nThe strangeness of this business; at pick\x92d leisure\nWhich shall be shortly, single I\x92ll resolve you,\nWhich to you shall seem probable, of every\nThese happen\x92d accidents; till when, be cheerful,                  250\nAnd think of each thing well.\n    [_Aside to Ari._] Come hither, spirit:\nSet Caliban and his companions free;\nUntie the spell. [_Exit Ariel._] How fares my gracious sir?\nThere are yet missing of your company\nSome few odd lads that you remember not.                           255\n\n  _Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO,\n  in their stolen apparel._\n\n_Ste._ Every man shift for all the rest, and let no man\ntake care for himself; for all is but fortune. --Coragio,\nbully-monster, coragio!\n\n_Trin._ If these be true spies which I wear in my head,\nhere\x92s a goodly sight.                                             260\n\n_Cal._ O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!\nHow fine my master is!

This mis-shapen knave,\nHis mother was a witch; and one so strong\nThat could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,                  270\nAnd deal in her command, without her power.\nThese three have robb\x92d me; and this demi-devil--\nFor he\x92s a bastard one--had plotted with them\nTo take my life. Two of these fellows you\nMust know and own; this thing of darkness I                        275\nAcknowledge mine.\n\n_Cal._          I shall be pinch\x92d to death.\n\n_Alon._ Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?\n\n_Seb._ He is drunk now: where had he wine?\n\n_Alon._ And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they\nFind this grand liquor that hath gilded \x92em?--                     280\nHow camest thou in this pickle?\n\n_Trin._ I have been in such a pickle, since I saw you\nlast, that, I fear me, will never out of my bones: I shall not\nfear fly-blowing.\n\n_Seb._ Why, how now, Stephano!                                     285\n\n_Ste._ O, touch me not;--I am not Stephano, but a cramp.\n\n_Pros._ You\x92ld be king o\x92 the isle, sirrah?\n\n_Ste._ I should have been a sore one, then.\n\n_Alon._ This is a strange thing as e\x92er I look\x92d on.\n                                [_Pointing to Caliban._\n\n_Pros._ He is as disproportion\x92d in his manners                    290\nAs in his shape.

Similar cases occur frequently, especially when the verb precedes\nits nominative. For example, _Tempest_, IV. 1. 262, \x91Lies at my mercy\nall mine enemies,\x92 and _Measure for Measure_, II. 1. 22, \x91What knows the\nlaws, &c.\x92 We correct it in those passages where the occurrence of a\nvulgarism would be likely to annoy the reader. In the mouth of a\nBoatswain it can offend no one. We therefore leave it.\n\n\nNOTE II.\n\nI. 1. 57-59. _Mercy on us!--we split, &c._ It may be doubtful whether\nthe printer of the first folio intended these broken speeches to express\n\x91a confused noise within.\x92 Without question such was the author\x92s\nmeaning. Rowe, however, and subsequent editors, printed them as part of\nGonzalo\x92s speech. Capell was the first editor who gave the true\narrangement.\n\n\nNOTE III.\n\nI. 2. 173. _princesses._ See Mr Sidney Walker\x92s _Shakespeare\x92s\nVersification_, p. 243 sqq. \x92The plurals of substantives ending in _s_,\nin certain instances, in _se_, _ss_, _ce_, and sometimes _ge_, ... are\nfound without the usual addition of _s_ or _es_, in pronunciation at\nleast, although in many instances the plural affix is added in printing,\nwhere the metre shows that it is not to be pronounced.\x92\n\nIn this and other instances, we have thought it better to trust to the\near of the reader for the rhythm than to introduce an innovation in\northography which might perplex him as to the sense. The form\n\x91princesses,\x92 the use of which in Shakespeare\x92s time was doubted by one\nof our correspondents, is found in the _History of King Leir_.\n\nRowe\x92s reading \x91princes\x92 might be defended on the ground that the\nsentiment is general, and applicable to royal children of both sexes; or\nthat Sir Philip Sidney, in the first book of the _Arcadia_, calls Pamela\nand Philoclea \x91princes.\x92\n\n\nNOTE IV.\n\nI. 2. 298. The metre of this line, as well as of lines 301, 302, is\ndefective, but as no mode of correction can be regarded as completely\nsatisfactory we have in accordance with our custom left the lines as\nthey are printed in the Folio. The defect, indeed, in the metre of line\n298 has not been noticed except by Hanmer, who makes a line thus:\n\n  \x91Do so, and after two days I\x92ll discharge thee.\x92\n\nPossibly it ought to be printed thus:\n\n              \x91Do so; and\n  After two days\n  I will discharge thee.\x92\n\nThere is a broken line, also of four syllables, 253 of the same scene,\nanother of seven, 235.\n\nThere is no reason to doubt that the _words_ are as Shakespeare wrote\nthem, for, although the action of the play terminates in less than four\nhours (I. 2. 240 and V. 1. 186), yet Ariel\x92s ministry is not to end till\nthe voyage to Naples shall be over. Prospero, too, repeats his promise,\nand marks his contentment by further shortening the time of servitude,\n\x91within two days,\x92 I. 2. 420. Possibly \x91Invisible\x92 (301) should have a\nline to itself. Words thus occupying a broken line acquire a marked\nemphasis.\n\nBut the truth is that in dialogue Shakespeare\x92s language passes so\nrapidly from verse to prose and from prose to verse, sometimes even\nhovering, as it were, over the confines, being rhythmical rather than\nmetrical, that all attempts to give regularity to the metre must be made\nwith diffidence and received with doubt.\n\n\n\n\n\n'

S"\n\nMuch adoe about Nothing\n\nActus primus, Scena prima.\n\nEnter Leonato Gouernour of Messina, Innogen his wife, Hero his\ndaughter,\nand Beatrice his Neece, with a messenger.\n\n  Leonato. I learne in this Letter, that Don Peter of Arragon,\ncomes this night to Messina\n\n   Mess. He is very neere by this: he was not\nthree Leagues off when I left him\n\n   Leon. How many Gentlemen haue you lost in this\naction?\n  Mess. But few of any sort, and none of name\n\n   Leon. A victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer\nbrings home full numbers: I finde heere, that Don Peter\nhath bestowed much honor on a yong Florentine, called\nClaudio\n\n   Mess. Much deseru'd on his part, and equally remembred\nby Don Pedro, he hath borne himselfe beyond the\npromise of his age, doing in the figure of a Lambe, the\nfeats of a Lion, he hath indeede better bettred expectation,\nthen you must expect of me to tell you how\n\n   Leo. He hath an Vnckle heere in Messina, wil be very\nmuch glad of it\n\n   Mess. I haue alreadie deliuered him letters, and there\nappeares much ioy in him, euen so much, that ioy could\nnot shew it selfe modest enough, without a badg of bitternesse\n\n   Leo. Did he breake out into teares?\n  Mess. In great measure\n\n   Leo. A kinde ouerflow of kindnesse, there are no faces\ntruer, then those that are so wash'd, how much better\nis it to weepe at ioy, then to ioy at weeping?\n  Bea. I pray you, is Signior Mountanto return'd from\nthe warres, or no?\n  Mess. I know none of that name, Lady, there was\nnone such in the armie of any sort\n\n   Leon. What is he that you aske for Neece?\n  Hero. My cousin meanes Signior Benedick of Padua\n  Mess. O he's return'd, and as pleasant as euer he was\n\n   Beat. He set vp his bils here in Messina, & challeng'd\nCupid at the Flight: and my Vnckles foole reading the\nChallenge, subscrib'd for Cupid, and challeng'd him at\nthe Burbolt. I pray you, how many hath hee kil'd and\neaten in these warres? But how many hath he kil'd? for\nindeed, I promis'd to eate all of his killing\n\n   Leon. 'Faith Neece, you taxe Signior Benedicke too\nmuch, but hee'l be meete with you, I doubt it not\n\n   Mess. He hath done good seruice Lady in these wars\n\n   Beat. You had musty victuall, and he hath holpe to\nease it: he's a very valiant Trencher-man, hee hath an\nexcellent stomacke\n\n   Mess. And a good souldier too Lady\n\n   Beat. And a good souldier to a Lady. But what is he\nto a Lord?\n  Mess. A Lord to a Lord, a man to a man, stuft with\nall honourable vertues\n\n   Beat. It is so indeed, he is no lesse then a stuft man:\nbut for the stuffing well, we are all mortall\n\n   Leon. You must not (sir) mistake my Neece, there is\na kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick, & her:\nthey neuer meet, but there's a skirmish of wit between\nthem\n\n   Bea. Alas, he gets nothing by that. In our last conflict,\nfoure of his fiue wits went halting off, and now is\nthe whole man gouern'd with one: so that if hee haue\nwit enough to keepe himselfe warme, let him beare it\nfor a difference betweene himselfe and his horse: For it\nis all the wealth that he hath left, to be knowne a reasonable\ncreature. Who is his companion now? He hath\neuery month a new sworne brother\n\n   Mess. Is't possible?\n  Beat. Very easily possible: he weares his faith but as\nthe fashion of his hat, it euer changes with y next block\n\n   Mess. I see (Lady) the Gentleman is not in your\nbookes\n\n   Bea. No, and he were, I would burne my study. But\nI pray you, who is his companion? Is there no young\nsquarer now, that will make a voyage with him to the\ndiuell?\n  Mess. He is most in the company of the right noble\nClaudio\n\n   Beat. O Lord, he will hang vpon him like a disease:\nhe is sooner caught then the pestilence, and the taker\nruns presently mad. God helpe the noble Claudio, if hee\nhaue caught the Benedict, it will cost him a thousand\npound ere he be cur'd\n\n   Mess. I will hold friends with you Lady\n\n   Bea. Do good friend\n\n   Leo. You'l ne're run mad Neece\n\n   Bea. No, not till a hot Ianuary\n\n   Mess. Don Pedro is approach'd.\n\nEnter don Pedro, Claudio, Benedicke, Balthasar, and Iohn the\nbastard.\n\n  Pedro. Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet\nyour trouble: the fashion of the world is to auoid cost,\nand you encounter it\n\n   Leon. Neuer came trouble to my house in the likenes\nof your Grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should\nremaine: but when you depart from me, sorrow abides,\nand happinesse takes his leaue\n\n   Pedro. You embrace your charge too willingly: I\nthinke this is your daughter\n\n   Leonato. Her mother hath many times told me so\n\n   Bened. Were you in doubt that you askt her?\n  Leonato. Signior Benedicke, no, for then were you a\nchilde\n\n   Pedro. You haue it full Benedicke, we may ghesse by\nthis, what you are, being a man, truely the Lady fathers\nher selfe: be happie Lady, for you are like an honorable\nfather\n\n   Ben. If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not\nhaue his head on her shoulders for al Messina, as like him\nas she is\n\n   Beat. I wonder that you will still be talking, signior\nBenedicke, no body markes you\n\n   Ben. What my deere Ladie Disdaine! are you yet\nliuing?\n  Beat. Is it possible Disdaine should die, while shee\nhath such meete foode to feede it, as Signior Benedicke?\nCurtesie it selfe must conuert to Disdaine, if you come in\nher presence\n\n   Bene. Then is curtesie a turne-coate, but it is certaine\nI am loued of all Ladies, onely you excepted: and\nI would I could finde in my heart that I had not a hard\nheart, for truely I loue none\n\n   Beat. A deere happinesse to women, they would else\nhaue beene troubled with a pernitious Suter, I thanke\nGod and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that, I\nhad rather heare my Dog barke at a Crow, than a man\nsweare he loues me\n\n   Bene. God keepe your Ladiship still in that minde,\nso some Gentleman or other shall scape a predestinate\nscratcht face\n\n   Beat. Scratching could not make it worse, and 'twere\nsuch a face as yours were\n\n   Bene. Well, you are a rare Parrat teacher\n\n   Beat. A bird of my tongue, is better than a beast of\nyour\n\n   Ben. I would my horse had the speed of your tongue,\nand so good a continuer, but keepe your way a Gods\nname, I haue done\n\n   Beat. You alwaies end with a Iades tricke, I know\nyou of old\n\n   Pedro. This is the summe of all: Leonato, signior Claudio,\nand signior Benedicke; my deere friend Leonato, hath\ninuited you all, I tell him we shall stay here, at the least\na moneth, and he heartily praies some occasion may detaine\nvs longer: I dare sweare hee is no hypocrite, but\npraies from his heart\n\n   Leon. If you sweare, my Lord, you shall not be forsworne,\nlet mee bid you welcome, my Lord, being reconciled\nto the Prince your brother: I owe you all\nduetie\n\n   Iohn. I thanke you, I am not of many words, but I\nthanke you\n\n   Leon. Please it your grace leade on?\n  Pedro. Your hand Leonato, we will goe together.\n\nExeunt. Manet Benedicke and Claudio.\n\n  Clau. Benedicke, didst thou note the daughter of signior\nLeonato?\n  Bene. I noted her not, but I lookt on her\n\n   Claud. Is she not a modest yong Ladie?\n  Bene. Doe you question me as an honest man should\ndoe, for my simple true iudgement? or would you haue\nme speake after my custome, as being a professed tyrant\nto their sexe?\n  Clau. No, I pray thee speake in sober iudgement\n\n   Bene. Why yfaith me thinks shee's too low for a hie\npraise, too browne for a faire praise, and too little for a\ngreat praise, onely this commendation I can affoord her,\nthat were shee other then she is, she were vnhandsome,\nand being no other, but as she is, I doe not like her\n\n   Clau. Thou think'st I am in sport, I pray thee tell me\ntruely how thou lik'st her\n\n   Bene. Would you buie her, that you enquier after\nher?\n  Clau. Can the world buie such a iewell?\n  Ben. Yea, and a case to put it into, but speake you this\nwith a sad brow? Or doe you play the flowting iacke, to\ntell vs Cupid is a good Hare-finder, and Vulcan a rare\nCarpenter: Come, in what key shall a man take you to\ngoe in the song?\n  Clau. In mine eie, she is the sweetest Ladie that euer\nI lookt on\n\n   Bene. I can see yet without spectacles, and I see no\nsuch matter: there's her cosin, and she were not possest\nwith a furie, exceedes her as much in beautie, as the first\nof Maie doth the last of December: but I hope you haue\nno intent to turne husband, haue you?\n  Clau. I would scarce trust my selfe, though I had\nsworne the contrarie, if Hero would be my wife\n\n   Bene. Ist come to this? in faith hath not the world one\nman but he will weare his cap with suspition? shall I neuer\nsee a batcheller of three score againe? goe to yfaith,\nand thou wilt needes thrust thy necke into a yoke, weare\nthe print of it, and sigh away sundaies: looke, don Pedro\nis returned to seeke you.\n\nEnter don Pedro, Iohn the bastard.\n\n  Pedr. What secret hath held you here, that you followed\nnot to Leonatoes?\n  Bened. I would your Grace would constraine mee to\ntell\n\n   Pedro. I charge thee on thy allegeance\n\n   Ben. You heare, Count Claudio, I can be secret as a\ndumbe man, I would haue you thinke so (but on my allegiance,\nmarke you this, on my allegiance) hee is in\nloue, With who? now that is your Graces part: marke\nhow short his answere is, with Hero, Leonatoes short\ndaughter\n\n   Clau. If this were so, so were it vttred\n\n   Bened. Like the old tale, my Lord, it is not so, nor 'twas\nnot so: but indeede, God forbid it should be so\n\n   Clau. If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it\nshould be otherwise\n\n   Pedro. Amen, if you loue her, for the Ladie is verie\nwell worthie\n\n   Clau. You speake this to fetch me in, my Lord\n\n   Pedr. By my troth I speake my thought\n\n   Clau. And in faith, my Lord, I spoke mine\n\n   Bened. And by my two faiths and troths, my Lord, I\nspeake mine\n\n   Clau. That I loue her, I feele\n\n   Pedr. That she is worthie, I know\n\n   Bened. That I neither feele how shee should be loued,\nnor know how shee should be worthie, is the\nopinion that fire cannot melt out of me, I will die in it at\nthe stake\n\n   Pedr. Thou wast euer an obstinate heretique in the despight\nof Beautie\n\n   Clau. And neuer could maintaine his part, but in the\nforce of his will\n  Ben. That a woman conceiued me, I thanke her: that\nshe brought mee vp, I likewise giue her most humble\nthankes: but that I will haue a rechate winded in my\nforehead, or hang my bugle in an inuisible baldricke, all\nwomen shall pardon me: because I will not do them the\nwrong to mistrust any, I will doe my selfe the right to\ntrust none: and the fine is, (for the which I may goe the\nfiner) I will liue a Batchellor\n\n   Pedro. I shall see thee ere I die, looke pale with loue\n\n   Bene. With anger, with sicknesse, or with hunger,\nmy Lord, not with loue: proue that euer I loose more\nblood with loue, then I will get againe with drinking,\npicke out mine eyes with a Ballet-makers penne, and\nhang me vp at the doore of a brothel-house for the signe\nof blinde Cupid\n\n   Pedro. Well, if euer thou doost fall from this faith,\nthou wilt proue a notable argument\n\n   Bene. If I do, hang me in a bottle like a Cat, & shoot\nat me, and he that hit's me, let him be clapt on the shoulder,\nand cal'd Adam\n\n   Pedro. Well, as time shall trie: In time the sauage\nBull doth beare the yoake\n\n   Bene. The sauage bull may, but if euer the sensible\nBenedicke beare it, plucke off the bulles hornes, and set\nthem in my forehead, and let me be vildely painted, and\nin such great Letters as they write, heere is good horse\nto hire: let them signifie vnder my signe, here you may\nsee Benedicke the married man\n\n   Clau. If this should euer happen, thou wouldst bee\nhorne mad\n\n   Pedro. Nay, if Cupid haue not spent all his Quiuer in\nVenice, thou wilt quake for this shortly\n\n   Bene. I looke for an earthquake too then\n\n   Pedro. Well, you will temporize with the houres, in\nthe meane time, good Signior Benedicke, repaire to Leonatoes,\ncommend me to him, and tell him I will not faile\nhim at supper, for indeede he hath made great preparation\n\n   Bene. I haue almost matter enough in me for such an\nEmbassage, and so I commit you\n\n   Clau. To the tuition of God. From my house, if I\nhad it\n\n   Pedro. The sixt of Iuly. Your louing friend, Benedick\n\n   Bene. Nay mocke not, mocke not; the body of your\ndiscourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and the\nguardes are but slightly basted on neither, ere you flout\nold ends any further, examine your conscience, and so I\nleaue you.\n\nEnter.\n\n  Clau. My Liege, your Highnesse now may doe mee\ngood\n\n   Pedro. My loue is thine to teach, teach it but how,\nAnd thou shalt see how apt it is to learne\nAny hard Lesson that may do thee good\n\n   Clau. Hath Leonato any sonne my Lord?\n  Pedro. No childe but Hero, she's his onely heire.\nDost thou affect her Claudio?\n  Clau. O my Lord,\nWhen you went onward on this ended action,\nI look'd vpon her with a souldiers eie,\nThat lik'd, but had a rougher taske in hand,\nThan to driue liking to the name of loue:\nBut now I am return'd, and that warre-thoughts\nHaue left their places vacant: in their roomes,\nCome thronging soft and delicate desires,\nAll prompting mee how faire yong Hero is,\nSaying I lik'd her ere I went to warres\n\n   Pedro. Thou wilt be like a louer presently,\nAnd tire the hearer with a booke of words:\nIf thou dost loue faire Hero, cherish it,\nAnd I will breake with her: wast not to this end,\nThat thou beganst to twist so fine a story?\n  Clau. How sweetly doe you minister to loue,\nThat know loues griefe by his complexion!\nBut lest my liking might too sodaine seeme,\nI would haue salu'd it with a longer treatise\n\n   Ped. What need y bridge much broder then the flood?\nThe fairest graunt is the necessitie:\nLooke what will serue, is fit: 'tis once, thou louest,\nAnd I will fit thee with the remedie,\nI know we shall haue reuelling to night,\nI will assume thy part in some disguise,\nAnd tell faire Hero I am Claudio,\nAnd in her bosome Ile vnclaspe my heart,\nAnd take her hearing prisoner with the force\nAnd strong incounter of my amorous tale:\nThen after, to her father will I breake,\nAnd the conclusion is, shee shall be thine,\nIn practise let vs put it presently.\n\nExeunt.\n\nEnter Leonato and an old man, brother to Leonato.\n\n  Leo. How now brother, where is my cosen your son:\nhath he prouided this musicke?\n  Old. He is very busie about it, but brother, I can tell\nyou newes that you yet dreamt not of\n\n   Lo. Are they good?\n  Old. As the euents stamps them, but they haue a good\ncouer: they shew well outward, the Prince and Count\nClaudio walking in a thick pleached alley in my orchard,\nwere thus ouer-heard by a man of mine: the Prince discouered\nto Claudio that hee loued my niece your daughter,\nand meant to acknowledge it this night in a dance,\nand if hee found her accordant, hee meant to take the\npresent time by the top, and instantly breake with you\nof it\n\n   Leo. Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?\n  Old. A good sharpe fellow, I will send for him, and\nquestion him your selfe\n\n   Leo. No, no; wee will hold it as a dreame, till it appeare\nit selfe: but I will acquaint my daughter withall,\nthat she may be the better prepared for an answer, if peraduenture\nthis bee true: goe you and tell her of it: coosins,\nyou know what you haue to doe, O I crie you mercie\nfriend, goe you with mee and I will vse your skill,\ngood cosin haue a care this busie time.\n\nExeunt.\n\nEnter Sir Iohn the Bastard, and Conrade his companion.\n\n  Con. What the good yeere my Lord, why are you\nthus out of measure sad?\n  Ioh. There is no measure in the occasion that breeds,\ntherefore the sadnesse is without limit\n\n   Con. You should heare reason\n\n   Iohn. And when I haue heard it, what blessing bringeth\nit?\n  Con. If not a present remedy, yet a patient sufferance\n\n   Ioh. I wonder that thou (being as thou saist thou art,\nborne vnder Saturne) goest about to apply a morall medicine,\nto a mortifying mischiefe: I cannot hide what I\nam: I must bee sad when I haue cause, and smile at no\nmans iests, eat when I haue stomacke, and wait for no\nmans leisure: sleepe when I am drowsie, and tend on no\nmans businesse, laugh when I am merry, and claw no man\nin his humor\n\n   Con. Yea, but you must not make the ful show of this,\ntill you may doe it without controllment, you haue of\nlate stood out against your brother, and hee hath tane\nyou newly into his grace, where it is impossible you\nshould take root, but by the faire weather that you make\nyour selfe, it is needful that you frame the season for your\nowne haruest\n\n   Iohn. I had rather be a canker in a hedge, then a rose\nin his grace, and it better fits my bloud to be disdain'd of\nall, then to fashion a carriage to rob loue from any: in this\n(though I cannot be said to be a flattering honest man)\nit must not be denied but I am a plaine dealing villaine, I\nam trusted with a mussell, and enfranchisde with a clog,\ntherefore I haue decreed, not to sing in my cage: if I had\nmy mouth, I would bite: if I had my liberty, I would do\nmy liking: in the meane time, let me be that I am, and\nseeke not to alter me\n\n   Con. Can you make no vse of your discontent?\n  Iohn. I will make all vse of it, for I vse it onely.\nWho comes here? what newes Borachio?\n\nEnter Borachio.\n\n  Bor. I came yonder from a great supper, the Prince\nyour brother is royally entertained by Leonato, and I can\ngiue you intelligence of an intended marriage\n\n   Iohn. Will it serue for any Modell to build mischiefe\non? What is hee for a foole that betrothes himselfe to\nvnquietnesse?\n  Bor. Mary it is your brothers right hand\n\n   Iohn. Who, the most exquisite Claudio?\n  Bor. Euen he\n\n   Iohn. A proper squier, and who, and who, which way\nlookes he?\n  Bor. Mary on Hero, the daughter and Heire of Leonato\n\n   Iohn. A very forward March-chicke, how came you\nto this:\n  Bor. Being entertain'd for a perfumer, as I was smoaking\na musty roome, comes me the Prince and Claudio,\nhand in hand in sad conference: I whipt behind the Arras,\nand there heard it agreed vpon, that the Prince should\nwooe Hero for himselfe, and hauing obtain'd her, giue\nher to Count Claudio\n\n   Iohn. Come, come, let vs thither, this may proue food\nto my displeasure, that young start-vp hath all the glorie\nof my ouerthrow: if I can crosse him any way, I blesse\nmy selfe euery way, you are both sure, and will assist\nmee?\n  Conr. To the death my Lord\n\n   Iohn. Let vs to the great supper, their cheere is the\ngreater that I am subdued, would the Cooke were of my\nminde: shall we goe proue whats to be done?\n  Bor. Wee'll wait vpon your Lordship.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nActus Secundus.\n\nEnter Leonato, his brother, his wife, Hero his daughter, and\nBeatrice his\nneece, and a kinsman.\n\n  Leonato. Was not Count Iohn here at supper?\n  Brother. I saw him not\n\n   Beatrice. How tartly that Gentleman lookes, I neuer\ncan see him, but I am heart-burn'd an howre after\n\n   Hero. He is of a very melancholy disposition\n\n   Beatrice. Hee were an excellent man that were made\niust in the mid-way betweene him and Benedicke, the one\nis too like an image and saies nothing, and the other too\nlike my Ladies eldest sonne, euermore tatling\n\n   Leon. Then halfe signior Benedicks tongue in Count\nIohns mouth, and halfe Count Iohns melancholy in Signior\nBenedicks face\n\n   Beat. With a good legge, and a good foot vnckle, and\nmoney enough in his purse, such a man would winne any\nwoman in the world, if he could get her good will\n\n   Leon. By my troth Neece, thou wilt neuer get thee a\nhusband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue\n\n   Brother. Infaith shee's too curst\n\n   Beat. Too curst is more then curst, I shall lessen Gods\nsending that way: for it is said, God sends a curst Cow\nshort hornes, but to a Cow too curst he sends none\n\n   Leon. So, by being too curst, God will send you no\nhornes\n\n   Beat. Iust, if he send me no husband, for the which\nblessing, I am at him vpon my knees euery morning and\neuening: Lord, I could not endure a husband with a\nbeard on his face, I had rather lie in the woollen\n\n   Leonato. You may light vpon a husband that hath no\nbeard\n\n   Beatrice. What should I doe with him? dresse him in\nmy apparell, and make him my waiting gentlewoman? he\nthat hath a beard, is more then a youth: and he that hath\nno beard, is lesse then a man: and hee that is more then a\nyouth, is not for mee: and he that is lesse then a man, I am\nnot for him: therefore I will euen take sixepence in earnest\nof the Berrord, and leade his Apes into hell\n\n   Leon. Well then, goe you into hell\n\n   Beat. No, but to the gate, and there will the Deuill\nmeete mee like an old Cuckold with hornes on his head,\nand say, get you to heauen Beatrice, get you to heauen,\nheere's no place for you maids, so deliuer I vp my Apes,\nand away to S[aint]. Peter: for the heauens, hee shewes mee\nwhere the Batchellers sit, and there liue wee as merry as\nthe day is long\n\n   Brother. Well neece, I trust you will be rul'd by your\nfather\n\n   Beatrice. Yes faith, it is my cosens dutie to make curtsie,\nand say, as it please you: but yet for all that cosin, let\nhim be a handsome fellow, or else make an other cursie,\nand say, father, as it please me\n\n   Leonato. Well neece, I hope to see you one day fitted\nwith a husband\n\n   Beatrice. Not till God make men of some other mettall\nthen earth, would it not grieue a woman to be ouermastred\nwith a peece of valiant dust: to make account of\nher life to a clod of waiward marle? no vnckle, ile none:\nAdams sonnes are my brethren, and truly I hold it a sinne\nto match in my kinred\n\n   Leon. Daughter, remember what I told you, if the\nPrince doe solicit you in that kinde, you know your answere\n\n   Beatrice. The fault will be in the musicke cosin, if you\nbe not woed in good time: if the Prince bee too important,\ntell him there is measure in euery thing, & so dance\nout the answere, for heare me Hero, wooing, wedding, &\nrepenting, is as a Scotch jigge, a measure, and a cinquepace:\nthe first suite is hot and hasty like a Scotch jigge\n(and full as fantasticall) the wedding manerly modest,\n(as a measure) full of state & aunchentry, and then comes\nrepentance, and with his bad legs falls into the cinquepace\nfaster and faster, till he sinkes into his graue\n\n   Leonato. Cosin you apprehend passing shrewdly\n\n   Beatrice. I haue a good eye vnckle, I can see a Church\nby daylight\n\n   Leon. The reuellers are entring brother, make good\nroome.\nEnter Prince, Pedro, Claudio, and Benedicke, and Balthasar, or\ndumbe Iohn,\nMaskers with a drum.\n\n  Pedro. Lady, will you walke about with your friend?\n  Hero. So you walke softly, and looke sweetly, and say\nnothing, I am yours for the walke, and especially when I\nwalke away\n\n   Pedro. With me in your company\n\n   Hero. I may say so when I please\n\n   Pedro. And when please you to say so?\n  Hero. When I like your fauour, for God defend the\nLute should be like the case\n\n   Pedro. My visor is Philemons roofe, within the house\nis Loue\n\n   Hero. Why then your visor should be thatcht\n\n   Pedro. Speake low if you speake Loue\n\n   Bene. Well, I would you did like me\n\n   Mar. So would not I for your owne sake, for I haue\nmanie ill qualities\n\n   Bene. Which is one?\n  Mar. I say my prayers alowd\n\n   Ben. I loue you the better, the hearers may cry Amen\n\n   Mar. God match me with a good dauncer\n\n   Balt. Amen\n\n   Mar. And God keepe him out of my sight when the\ndaunce is done: answer Clarke\n\n   Balt. No more words, the Clarke is answered\n\n   Vrsula. I know you well enough, you are Signior Anthonio\n\n   Anth. At a word, I am not\n\n   Vrsula. I know you by the wagling of your head\n\n   Anth. To tell you true, I counterfet him\n\n   Vrsu. You could neuer doe him so ill well, vnlesse\nyou were the very man: here's his dry hand vp & down,\nyou are he, you are he\n\n   Anth. At a word I am not\n\n   Vrsula. Come, come, doe you thinke I doe not know\nyou by your excellent wit? can vertue hide it selfe? goe\nto mumme, you are he, graces will appeare, and there's\nan end\n\n   Beat. Will you not tell me who told you so?\n  Bene. No, you shall pardon me\n\n   Beat. Nor will you not tell me who you are?\n  Bened. Not now\n\n   Beat. That I was disdainfull, and that I had my good\nwit out of the hundred merry tales: well, this was Signior\nBenedicke that said so\n\n   Bene. What's he?\n  Beat. I am sure you know him well enough\n\n   Bene. Not I, beleeue me\n\n   Beat. Did he neuer make you laugh?\n  Bene. I pray you what is he?\n  Beat. Why he is the Princes ieaster, a very dull foole,\nonely his gift is, in deuising impossible slanders, none\nbut Libertines delight in him, and the commendation is\nnot in his witte, but in his villanie, for hee both pleaseth\nmen and angers them, and then they laugh at him, and\nbeat him: I am sure he is in the Fleet, I would he had\nboorded me\n\n   Bene. When I know the Gentleman, Ile tell him what\nyou say\n\n   Beat. Do, do, hee'l but breake a comparison or two\non me, which peraduenture (not markt, or not laugh'd\nat) strikes him into melancholly, and then there's a Partridge\nwing saued, for the foole will eate no supper that\nnight. We must follow the Leaders\n\n   Ben. In euery good thing\n\n   Bea. Nay, if they leade to any ill, I will leaue them\nat the next turning.\n\nExeunt.\n\nMusicke for the dance.\n\n  Iohn. Sure my brother is amorous on Hero, and hath\nwithdrawne her father to breake with him about it: the\nLadies follow her, and but one visor remaines\n\n   Borachio. And that is Claudio, I know him by his bearing\n\n   Iohn. Are not you signior Benedicke?\n  Clau. You know me well, I am hee\n\n   Iohn. Signior, you are verie neere my Brother in his\nloue, he is enamor'd on Hero, I pray you disswade him\nfrom her, she is no equall for his birth: you may do the\npart of an honest man in it\n\n   Claudio. How know you he loues her?\n  Iohn. I heard him sweare his affection\n\n   Bor. So did I too, and he swore he would marrie her\nto night\n\n   Iohn. Come, let vs to the banquet.\n\nEx. manet Clau.\n\n  Clau. Thus answere I in name of Benedicke,\nBut heare these ill newes with the eares of Claudio:\n'Tis certaine so, the Prince woes for himselfe:\nFriendship is constant in all other things,\nSaue in the Office and affaires of loue:\nTherefore all hearts in loue vse their owne tongues.\nLet euerie eye negotiate for it selfe,\nAnd trust no Agent: for beautie is a witch,\nAgainst whose charmes, faith melteth into blood:\nThis is an accident of hourely proofe,\nWhich I mistrusted not. Farewell therefore Hero.\nEnter Benedicke.\n\n  Ben. Count Claudio\n\n   Clau. Yea, the same\n\n   Ben. Come, will you goe with me?\n  Clau. Whither?\n  Ben. Euen to the next Willow, about your own businesse,\nCount. What fashion will you weare the Garland\noff? About your necke, like an Vsurers chaine? Or\nvnder your arme, like a Lieutenants scarfe? You must\nweare it one way, for the Prince hath got your Hero\n\n   Clau . I wish him ioy of her\n\n   Ben. Why that's spoken like an honest Drouier, so\nthey sel Bullockes: but did you thinke the Prince wold\nhaue serued you thus?\n  Clau. I pray you leaue me\n\n   Ben. Ho now you strike like the blindman, 'twas the\nboy that stole your meate, and you'l beat the post\n\n   Clau. If it will not be, Ile leaue you.\nEnter.\n\n  Ben. Alas poore hurt fowle, now will he creepe into\nsedges: But that my Ladie Beatrice should know me, &\nnot know me: the Princes foole! Hah? It may be I goe\nvnder that title, because I am merrie: yea but so I am\napt to do my selfe wrong: I am not so reputed, it is the\nbase (though bitter) disposition of Beatrice, that putt's\nthe world into her person, and so giues me out: well, Ile\nbe reuenged as I may.\nEnter the Prince.\n\n  Pedro. Now Signior, where's the Count, did you\nsee him?\n  Bene. Troth my Lord, I haue played the part of Lady\nFame, I found him heere as melancholy as a Lodge in a\nWarren, I told him, and I thinke, told him true, that your\ngrace had got the will of this young Lady, and I offered\nhim my company to a willow tree, either to make him a\ngarland, as being forsaken, or to binde him a rod, as being\nworthy to be whipt\n\n   Pedro. To be whipt, what's his fault?\n  Bene. The flat transgression of a Schoole-boy, who\nbeing ouer-ioyed with finding a birds nest, shewes it his\ncompanion, and he steales it\n\n   Pedro. Wilt thou make a trust, a transgression? the\ntransgression is in the stealer\n\n   Ben. Yet it had not been amisse the rod had beene\nmade, and the garland too, for the garland he might haue\nworne himselfe, and the rod hee might haue bestowed on\nyou, who (as I take it) haue stolne his birds nest\n\n   Pedro. I will but teach them to sing, and restore them\nto the owner\n\n   Bene. If their singing answer your saying, by my faith\nyou say honestly\n\n   Pedro. The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrell to you, the\nGentleman that daunst with her, told her shee is much\nwrong'd by you\n\n   Bene. O she misusde me past the indurance of a block:\nan oake but with one greene leafe on it, would haue answered\nher: my very visor began to assume life, and scold\nwith her: shee told mee, not thinking I had beene my\nselfe, that I was the Princes Iester, and that I was duller\nthen a great thaw, hudling iest vpon iest, with such impossible\nconueiance vpon me, that I stood like a man at a\nmarke, with a whole army shooting at me: shee speakes\npoynyards, and euery word stabbes: if her breath were\nas terrible as terminations, there were no liuing neere\nher, she would infect to the north starre: I would not\nmarry her, though she were indowed with all that Adam\nhad left him before he transgrest, she would haue made\n  Hercules haue turnd spit, yea, and haue cleft his club to\nmake the fire too: come, talke not of her, you shall finde\nher the infernall Ate in good apparell. I would to God\nsome scholler would coniure her, for certainely while she\nis heere, a man may liue as quiet in hell, as in a sanctuary,\nand people sinne vpon purpose, because they would goe\nthither, so indeed all disquiet, horror, and perturbation\nfollowes her.\nEnter Claudio and Beatrice, Leonato, Hero.\n\n  Pedro. Looke heere she comes\n\n   Bene. Will your Grace command mee any seruice to\nthe worlds end? I will goe on the slightest arrand now\nto the Antypodes that you can deuise to send me on: I\nwill fetch you a tooth-picker now from the furthest inch\nof Asia: bring you the length of Prester Iohns foot: fetch\nyou a hayre off the great Chams beard: doe you any embassage\nto the Pigmies, rather then hould three words\nconference, with this Harpy: you haue no employment\nfor me?\n  Pedro. None, but to desire your good company\n\n   Bene. O God sir, heeres a dish I loue not, I cannot indure\nthis Lady tongue.\nEnter.\n\n  Pedr. Come Lady, come, you haue lost the heart of\nSignior Benedicke\n\n   Beatr. Indeed my Lord, hee lent it me a while, and I\ngaue him vse for it, a double heart for a single one, marry\nonce before he wonne it of mee, with false dice, therefore\nyour Grace may well say I haue lost it\n\n   Pedro. You haue put him downe Lady, you haue put\nhim downe\n\n   Beat. So I would not he should do me, my Lord, lest\nI should prooue the mother of fooles: I haue brought\nCount Claudio, whom you sent me to seeke\n\n   Pedro. Why how now Count, wherfore are you sad?\n  Claud. Not sad my Lord\n\n   Pedro. How then? sicke?\n  Claud. Neither, my Lord\n\n   Beat. The Count is neither sad, nor sicke, nor merry,\nnor well: but ciuill Count, ciuill as an Orange, and something\nof a iealous complexion\n\n   Pedro. Ifaith Lady, I thinke your blazon to be true.\nthough Ile be sworne, if hee be so, his conceit is false:\nheere Claudio, I haue wooed in thy name, and faire Hero\nis won, I haue broke with her father, and his good will\nobtained, name the day of marriage, and God giue\nthee ioy\n\n   Leona. Count, take of me my daughter, and with her\nmy fortunes: his grace hath made the match, & all grace\nsay, Amen to it\n\n   Beatr. Speake Count, tis your Qu\n\n   Claud. Silence is the perfectest Herault of ioy, I were\nbut little happy if I could say, how much? Lady, as you\nare mine, I am yours, I giue away my selfe for you, and\ndoat vpon the exchange\n\n   Beat. Speake cosin, or (if you cannot) stop his mouth\nwith a kisse, and let not him speake neither\n\n   Pedro. In faith Lady you haue a merry heart\n\n   Beatr. Yea my Lord I thanke it, poore foole it keepes\non the windy side of Care, my coosin tells him in his eare\nthat he is in my heart\n\n   Clau. And so she doth coosin\n\n   Beat. Good Lord for alliance: thus goes euery one\nto the world but I, and I am sun-burn'd, I may sit in a corner\nand cry, heigh ho for a husband\n\n   Pedro. Lady Beatrice, I will get you one\n\n   Beat. I would rather haue one of your fathers getting:\nhath your Grace ne're a brother like you? your father\ngot excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them\n\n   Prince. Will you haue me? Lady\n\n   Beat. No, my Lord, vnlesse I might haue another for\nworking-daies, your Grace is too costly to weare euerie\nday: but I beseech your Grace pardon mee, I was borne\nto speake all mirth, and no matter\n\n   Prince. Your silence most offends me, and to be merry,\nbest becomes you, for out of question, you were born\nin a merry howre\n\n   Beatr. No sure my Lord, my Mother cried, but then\nthere was a starre daunst, and vnder that was I borne: cosins\nGod giue you ioy\n\n   Leonato. Neece, will you looke to those things I told\nyou of?\n  Beat. I cry you mercy Vncle, by your Graces pardon.\n\nExit Beatrice.\n\n  Prince. By my troth a pleasant spirited Lady\n\n   Leon. There's little of the melancholy element in her\nmy Lord, she is neuer sad, but when she sleepes, and not\neuer sad then: for I haue heard my daughter say, she hath\noften dreamt of vnhappinesse, and wakt her selfe with\nlaughing\n\n   Pedro. Shee cannot indure to heare tell of a husband\n\n   Leonato. O, by no meanes, she mocks all her wooers\nout of suite\n\n   Prince. She were an excellent wife for Benedick\n\n   Leonato. O Lord, my Lord, if they were but a weeke\nmarried, they would talke themselues madde\n\n   Prince. Counte Claudio, when meane you to goe to\nChurch?\n  Clau. To morrow my Lord, Time goes on crutches,\ntill Loue haue all his rites\n\n   Leonato. Not till monday, my deare sonne, which is\nhence a iust seuen night, and a time too briefe too, to haue\nall things answer minde\n\n   Prince. Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing,\nbut I warrant thee Claudio, the time shall not goe\ndully by vs, I will in the interim, vndertake one of Hercules\nlabors, which is, to bring Signior Benedicke and the\nLady Beatrice into a mountaine of affection, th' one with\nth' other, I would faine haue it a match, and I doubt not\nbut to fashion it, if you three will but minister such assistance\nas I shall giue you direction\n\n   Leonato. My Lord, I am for you, though it cost mee\nten nights watchings\n\n   Claud. And I my Lord\n\n   Prin. And you to gentle Hero?\n  Hero. I will doe any modest office, my Lord, to helpe\nmy cosin to a good husband\n\n   Prin. And Benedick is not the vnhopefullest husband\nthat I know: thus farre can I praise him, hee is of a noble\nstraine, of approued valour, and confirm'd honesty, I will\nteach you how to humour your cosin, that shee shall fall\nin loue with Benedicke, and I, with your two helpes, will\nso practise on Benedicke, that in despight of his quicke\nwit, and his queasie stomacke, hee shall fall in loue with\nBeatrice: if wee can doe this, Cupid is no longer an Archer,\nhis glory shall be ours, for wee are the onely louegods,\ngoe in with me, and I will tell you my drift.\nEnter.\n\nEnter Iohn and Borachio.\n\n  Ioh. It is so, the Count Claudio shal marry the daughter\nof Leonato\n\n   Bora. Yea my Lord, but I can crosse it\n\n   Iohn. Any barre, any crosse, any impediment, will be\nmedicinable to me, I am sicke in displeasure to him, and\nwhatsoeuer comes athwart his affection, ranges euenly\nwith mine, how canst thou crosse this marriage?\n  Bor. Not honestly my Lord, but so couertly, that no\ndishonesty shall appeare in me\n\n   Iohn. Shew me breefely how\n\n   Bor. I thinke I told your Lordship a yeere since, how\nmuch I am in the fauour of Margaret, the waiting gentlewoman\nto Hero\n\n   Iohn. I remember\n\n   Bor. I can at any vnseasonable instant of the night,\nappoint her to looke out at her Ladies chamber window\n\n   Iohn. What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?\n  Bor. The poyson of that lies in you to temper, goe\nyou to the Prince your brother, spare not to tell him, that\nhee hath wronged his Honor in marrying the renowned\nClaudio, whose estimation do you mightily hold vp, to a\ncontaminated stale, such a one as Hero\n\n   Iohn. What proofe shall I make of that?\n  Bor. Proofe enough, to misuse the Prince, to vexe\nClaudio, to vndoe Hero, and kill Leonato, looke you for any\nother issue?\n  Iohn. Onely to despight them, I will endeauour any\nthing\n\n   Bor. Goe then, finde me a meete howre, to draw on\nPedro and the Count Claudio alone, tell them that you\nknow that Hero loues me, intend a kinde of zeale both\nto the Prince and Claudio (as in a loue of your brothers\nhonor who hath made this match) and his friends reputation,\nwho is thus like to be cosen'd with the semblance\nof a maid, that you haue discouer'd thus: they will scarcely\nbeleeue this without triall: offer them instances which\nshall beare no lesse likelihood, than to see mee at her\nchamber window, heare me call Margaret, Hero; heare\nMargaret terme me Claudio, and bring them to see this\nthe very night before the intended wedding, for in the\nmeane time, I will so fashion the matter, that Hero shall\nbe absent, and there shall appeare such seeming truths of\nHeroes disloyaltie, that iealousie shall be cal'd assurance,\nand all the preparation ouerthrowne\n\n   Iohn. Grow this to what aduerse issue it can, I will\nput it in practise: be cunning in the working this, and\nthy fee is a thousand ducates\n\n   Bor. Be thou constant in the accusation, and my cunning\nshall not shame me\n\n   Iohn. I will presentlie goe learne their day of marriage.\nEnter.\n\nEnter Benedicke alone.\n\n  Bene. Boy\n\n   Boy. Signior\n\n   Bene. In my chamber window lies a booke, bring it\nhither to me in the orchard\n\n   Boy. I am heere already sir.\nEnter.\n\n  Bene. I know that, but I would haue thee hence, and\nheere againe. I doe much wonder, that one man seeing\nhow much another man is a foole, when he dedicates his\nbehauiours to loue, will after hee hath laught at such\nshallow follies in others, become the argument of his\nowne scorne, by falling in loue, & such a man is Claudio.\nI haue known when there was no musicke with him but\nthe drum and the fife, and now had hee rather heare the\ntaber and the pipe: I haue knowne when he would haue\nwalkt ten mile afoot, to see a good armor, and now will\nhe lie ten nights awake caruing the fashion of a new dublet:\nhe was wont to speake plaine, & to the purpose (like\nan honest man & a souldier) and now is he turn'd orthography,\nhis words are a very fantasticall banquet, iust so\nmany strange dishes: may I be so conuerted, & see with\nthese eyes? I cannot tell, I thinke not: I will not bee\nsworne, but loue may transforme me to an oyster, but Ile\ntake my oath on it, till he haue made an oyster of me, he\nshall neuer make me such a foole: one woman is faire, yet\nI am well: another is wise, yet I am well: another vertuous,\nyet I am well: but till all graces be in one woman,\none woman shall not come in my grace: rich shee shall\nbe, that's certaine: wise, or Ile none: vertuous, or Ile neuer\ncheapen her: faire, or Ile neuer looke on her: milde,\nor come not neere me: Noble, or not for an Angell: of\ngood discourse: an excellent Musitian, and her haire shal\nbe of what colour it please God, hah! the Prince and\nMonsieur Loue, I will hide me in the Arbor.\nEnter Prince, Leonato, Claudio, and Iacke Wilson.\n\n  Prin. Come, shall we heare this musicke?\n  Claud. Yea my good Lord: how still the euening is.\nAs husht on purpose to grace harmonie\n\n   Prin. See you where Benedicke hath hid himselfe?\n  Clau. O very well my Lord: the musicke ended,\nWee'll fit the kid-foxe with a penny worth\n\n   Prince. Come Balthasar, wee'll heare that song again\n\n   Balth. O good my Lord, taxe not so bad a voyce,\nTo slander musicke any more then once\n\n   Prin. It is the witnesse still of excellency,\nTo slander Musicke any more then once\n\n   Prince. It is the witnesse still of excellencie,\nTo put a strange face on his owne perfection,\nI pray thee sing, and let me woe no more\n\n   Balth. Because you talke of wooing, I will sing,\nSince many a wooer doth commence his suit,\nTo her he thinkes not worthy, yet he wooes,\nYet will he sweare he loues\n\n   Prince. Nay pray thee come,\nOr if thou wilt hold longer argument,\nDoe it in notes\n\n   Balth. Note this before my notes,\nTheres not a note of mine that's worth the noting\n\n   Prince. Why these are very crotchets that he speaks,\nNote notes forsooth, and nothing\n\n   Bene. Now diuine aire, now is his soule rauisht, is it\nnot strange that sheepes guts should hale soules out of\nmens bodies? well, a horne for my money when all's\ndone.\n\nThe Song.\n\nSigh no more Ladies, sigh no more,\nMen were deceiuers euer,\nOne foote in Sea, and one on shore,\nTo one thing constant neuer,\nThen sigh not so, but let them goe,\nAnd be you blithe and bonnie,\nConuerting all your sounds of woe,\nInto hey nony nony.\nSing no more ditties, sing no moe,\nOf dumps so dull and heauy,\nThe fraud of men were euer so,\nSince summer first was leauy,\nThen sigh not so, &c\n\n   Prince. By my troth a good song\n\n   Balth. And an ill singer, my Lord\n\n   Prince. Ha, no, no faith, thou singst well enough for a\nshift\n\n   Ben. And he had been a dog that should haue howld\nthus, they would haue hang'd him, and I pray God his\nbad voyce bode no mischiefe, I had as liefe haue heard\nthe night-rauen, come what plague could haue come after\nit\n\n   Prince. Yea marry, dost thou heare Balthasar? I pray\nthee get vs some excellent musick: for to morrow night\nwe would haue it at the Lady Heroes chamber window\n\n   Balth. The best I can, my Lord.\n\nExit Balthasar.\n\n  Prince. Do so, farewell. Come hither Leonato, what\nwas it you told me of to day, that your Niece Beatrice\nwas in loue with signior Benedicke?\n  Cla. O I, stalke on, stalke on, the foule sits. I did neuer\nthinke that Lady would haue loued any man\n\n   Leon. No, nor I neither, but most wonderful, that she\nshould so dote on Signior Benedicke, whom shee hath in\nall outward behauiours seemed euer to abhorre\n\n   Bene. Is't possible? sits the winde in that corner?\n  Leo. By my troth my Lord, I cannot tell what to\nthinke of it, but that she loues him with an inraged affection,\nit is past the infinite of thought\n\n   Prince. May be she doth but counterfeit\n\n   Claud. Faith like enough\n\n   Leon. O God! counterfeit? there was neuer counterfeit\nof passion, came so neere the life of passion as she discouers\nit\n\n   Prince. Why what effects of passion shewes she?\n  Claud. Baite the hooke well, this fish will bite\n\n   Leon. What effects my Lord? shee will sit you, you\nheard my daughter tell you how\n\n   Clau. She did indeed\n\n   Prince. How, how I pray you? you amaze me, I would\nhaue thought her spirit had beene inuincible against all\nassaults of affection\n\n   Leo. I would haue sworne it had, my Lord, especially\nagainst Benedicke\n\n   Bene. I should thinke this a gull, but that the whitebearded\nfellow speakes it: knauery cannot sure hide\nhimselfe in such reuerence\n\n   Claud. He hath tane th' infection, hold it vp\n\n   Prince. Hath shee made her affection known to Benedicke:\n  Leonato. No, and sweares she neuer will, that's her\ntorment\n\n   Claud. 'Tis true indeed, so your daughter saies: shall\nI, saies she, that haue so oft encountred him with scorne,\nwrite to him that I loue him?\n  Leo. This saies shee now when shee is beginning to\nwrite to him, for shee'll be vp twenty times a night, and\nthere will she sit in her smocke, till she haue writ a sheet\nof paper: my daughter tells vs all\n\n   Clau. Now you talke of a sheet of paper, I remember\na pretty iest your daughter told vs of\n\n   Leon. O when she had writ it, & was reading it ouer,\nshe found Benedicke and Beatrice betweene the sheete\n\n   Clau. That\n\n   Leon. O she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence,\nraild at her self, that she should be so immodest to write,\nto one that shee knew would flout her: I measure him,\nsaies she, by my owne spirit, for I should flout him if hee\nwrit to mee, yea though I loue him, I should\n\n   Clau. Then downe vpon her knees she falls, weepes,\nsobs, beates her heart, teares her hayre, praies, curses, O\nsweet Benedicke, God giue me patience\n\n   Leon. She doth indeed, my daughter saies so, and the\nextasie hath so much ouerborne her, that my daughter is\nsomtime afeard she will doe a desperate out-rage to her\nselfe, it is very true\n\n   Prince. It were good that Benedicke knew of it by some\nother, if she will not discouer it\n\n   Clau. To what end? he would but make a sport of it,\nand torment the poore Lady worse\n\n   Prin. And he should, it were an almes to hang him,\nshee's an excellent sweet Lady, and (out of all suspition,)\nshe is vertuous\n\n   Claudio. And she is exceeding wise\n\n   Prince. In euery thing, but in louing Benedicke\n\n   Leon. O my Lord, wisedome and bloud combating in\nso tender a body, we haue ten proofes to one, that bloud\nhath the victory, I am sorry for her, as I haue iust cause,\nbeing her Vncle, and her Guardian\n\n   Prince. I would shee had bestowed this dotage on\nmee, I would haue daft all other respects, and made her\nhalfe my selfe: I pray you tell Benedicke of it, and heare\nwhat he will say\n\n   Leon. Were it good thinke you?\n  Clau. Hero thinkes surely she wil die, for she saies she\nwill die, if hee loue her not, and shee will die ere shee\nmake her loue knowne, and she will die if hee wooe her,\nrather than shee will bate one breath of her accustomed\ncrossenesse\n\n   Prince. She doth well, if she should make tender of her\nloue, 'tis very possible hee'l scorne it, for the man (as you\nknow all) hath a contemptible spirit\n\n   Clau. He is a very proper man\n\n   Prin. He hath indeed a good outward happines\n\n   Clau. 'Fore God, and in my minde very wise\n\n   Prin. He doth indeed shew some sparkes that are like\nwit\n\n   Leon. And I take him to be valiant\n\n   Prin. As Hector, I assure you, and in the managing of\nquarrels you may see hee is wise, for either hee auoydes\nthem with great discretion, or vndertakes them with a\nChristian-like feare\n\n   Leon. If hee doe feare God, a must necessarilie keepe\npeace, if hee breake the peace, hee ought to enter into a\nquarrell with feare and trembling\n\n   Prin. And so will he doe, for the man doth fear God,\nhowsoeuer it seemes not in him, by some large ieasts hee\nwill make: well, I am sorry for your niece, shall we goe\nsee Benedicke, and tell him of her loue\n\n   Claud. Neuer tell him, my Lord, let her weare it out\nwith good counsell\n\n   Leon. Nay that's impossible, she may weare her heart\nout first\n\n   Prin. Well, we will heare further of it by your daughter,\nlet it coole the while, I loue Benedicke well, and I\ncould wish he would modestly examine himselfe, to see\nhow much he is vnworthy to haue so good a Lady\n\n   Leon. My Lord, will you walke? dinner is ready\n\n   Clau. If he do not doat on her vpon this, I wil neuer\ntrust my expectation\n\n   Prin. Let there be the same Net spread for her, and\nthat must your daughter and her gentlewoman carry:\nthe sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of anothers\ndotage, and no such matter, that's the Scene that I\nwould see, which will be meerely a dumbe shew: let vs\nsend her to call him into dinner.\n\nExeunt.\n\n  Bene. This can be no tricke, the conference was sadly\nborne, they haue the truth of this from Hero, they seeme\nto pittie the Lady: it seemes her affections haue the full\nbent: loue me? why it must be requited: I heare how I\nam censur'd, they say I will beare my selfe proudly, if I\nperceiue the loue come from her: they say too, that she\nwill rather die than giue any signe of affection: I did neuer\nthinke to marry, I must not seeme proud, happy are\nthey that heare their detractions, and can put them to\nmending: they say the Lady is faire, 'tis a truth, I can\nbeare them witnesse: and vertuous, tis so, I cannot reprooue\nit, and wise, but for louing me, by my troth it is\nno addition to her witte, nor no great argument of her\nfolly; for I wil be horribly in loue with her, I may chance\nhaue some odde quirkes and remnants of witte broken\non mee, because I haue rail'd so long against marriage:\nbut doth not the appetite alter? a man loues the meat in\nhis youth, that he cannot indure in his age. Shall quips\nand sentences, and these paper bullets of the braine awe\na man from the careere of his humour? No, the world\nmust be peopled. When I said I would die a batcheler, I\ndid not think I should liue till I were maried, here comes\nBeatrice: by this day, shee's a faire Lady, I doe spie some\nmarkes of loue in her.\nEnter Beatrice.\n\n  Beat. Against my wil I am sent to bid you come in to\ndinner\n\n   Bene. Faire Beatrice, I thanke you for your paines\n\n   Beat. I tooke no more paines for those thankes, then\nyou take paines to thanke me, if it had been painefull, I\nwould not haue come\n\n   Bene. You take pleasure then in the message\n\n   Beat. Yea iust so much as you may take vpon a kniues\npoint, and choake a daw withall: you haue no stomacke\nsignior, fare you well.\nEnter.\n\n  Bene. Ha, against my will I am sent to bid you come\ninto dinner: there's a double meaning in that: I tooke\nno more paines for those thankes then you took paines\nto thanke me, that's as much as to say, any paines that I\ntake for you is as easie as thankes: if I do not take pitty\nof her I am a villaine, if I doe not loue her I am a Iew, I\nwill goe get her picture.\nEnter.\n\n\nActus Tertius.\n\nEnter Hero and two Gentlemen, Margaret, and Vrsula.\n\n  Hero. Good Margaret runne thee to the parlour,\nThere shalt thou finde my Cosin Beatrice,\nProposing with the Prince and Claudio,\nWhisper her eare, and tell her I and Vrsula,\nWalke in the Orchard, and our whole discourse\nIs all of her, say that thou ouer-heardst vs,\nAnd bid her steale into the pleached bower,\nWhere hony-suckles ripened by the sunne,\nForbid the sunne to enter: like fauourites,\nMade proud by Princes, that aduance their pride,\nAgainst that power that bred it, there will she hide her,\nTo listen our purpose, this is thy office,\nBeare thee well in it, and leaue vs alone\n\n   Marg. Ile make her come I warrant you presently\n\n   Hero. Now Vrsula, when Beatrice doth come,\nAs we do trace this alley vp and downe,\nOur talke must onely be of Benedicke,\nWhen I doe name him, let it be thy part,\nTo praise him more then euer man did merit,\nMy talke to thee must be how Benedicke\nIs sicke in loue with Beatrice; of this matter,\nIs little Cupids crafty arrow made,\nThat onely wounds by heare-say: now begin,\nEnter Beatrice.\n\nFor looke where Beatrice like a Lapwing runs\nClose by the ground, to heare our conference\n\n   Vrs. The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish\nCut with her golden ores the siluer streame,\nAnd greedily deuoure the treacherous baite:\nSo angle we for Beatrice, who euen now,\nIs couched in the wood-bine couerture,\nFeare you not my part of the Dialogue\n\n   Her. Then go we neare her that her eare loose nothing,\nOf the false sweete baite that we lay for it:\nNo truely Vrsula, she is too disdainfull,\nI know her spirits are as coy and wilde,\nAs Haggerds of the rocke\n\n   Vrsula. But are you sure,\nThat Benedicke loues Beatrice so intirely?\n  Her. So saies the Prince, and my new trothed Lord\n\n   Vrs. And did they bid you tell her of it, Madam?\n  Her. They did intreate me to acquaint her of it,\nBut I perswaded them, if they lou'd Benedicke,\nTo wish him wrastle with affection,\nAnd neuer to let Beatrice know of it\n\n   Vrsula. Why did you so, doth not the Gentleman\nDeserue as full as fortunate a bed,\nAs euer Beatrice shall couch vpon?\n  Hero. O God of loue! I know he doth deserue,\nAs much as may be yeelded to a man:\nBut Nature neuer fram'd a womans heart,\nOf prowder stuffe then that of Beatrice:\nDisdaine and Scorne ride sparkling in her eyes,\nMis-prizing what they looke on, and her wit\nValues it selfe so highly, that to her\nAll matter else seemes weake: she cannot loue,\nNor take no shape nor proiect of affection,\nShee is so selfe indeared\n\n   Vrsula. Sure I thinke so,\nAnd therefore certainely it were not good\nShe knew his loue, lest she make sport at it\n\n   Hero. Why you speake truth, I neuer yet saw man,\nHow wise, how noble, yong, how rarely featur'd.\nBut she would spell him backward: if faire fac'd,\nShe would sweare the gentleman should be her sister:\nIf blacke, why Nature drawing of an anticke,\nMade a foule blot: if tall, a launce ill headed:\nIf low, an agot very vildlie cut:\nIf speaking, why a vane blowne with all windes:\nIf silent, why a blocke moued with none.\nSo turnes she euery man the wrong side out,\nAnd neuer giues to Truth and Vertue, that\nWhich simplenesse and merit purchaseth\n\n   Vrsu. Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable\n\n   Hero. No, not to be so odde, and from all fashions,\nAs Beatrice is, cannot be commendable,\nBut who dare tell her so? if I should speake,\nShe would mocke me into ayre, O she would laugh me\nOut of my selfe, presse me to death with wit,\nTherefore let Benedicke like couered fire,\nConsume away in sighes, waste inwardly:\nIt were a better death, to die with mockes,\nWhich is as bad as die with tickling\n\n   Vrsu. Yet tell her of it, heare what shee will say\n\n   Hero. No, rather I will goe to Benedicke,\nAnd counsaile him to fight against his passion,\nAnd truly Ile deuise some honest slanders,\nTo staine my cosin with, one doth not know,\nHow much an ill word may impoison liking\n\n   Vrsu. O doe not doe your cosin such a wrong,\nShe cannot be so much without true iudgement,\nHauing so swift and excellent a wit\nAs she is prisde to haue, as to refuse\nSo rare a Gentleman as signior Benedicke\n\n   Hero. He is the onely man of Italy,\nAlwaies excepted, my deare Claudio\n\n   Vrsu. I pray you be not angry with me, Madame,\nSpeaking my fancy: Signior Benedicke,\nFor shape, for bearing argument and valour,\nGoes formost in report through Italy\n\n   Hero. Indeed he hath an excellent good name\n\n   Vrsu. His excellence did earne it ere he had it:\nWhen are you married Madame?\n  Hero. Why euerie day to morrow, come goe in,\nIle shew thee some attires, and haue thy counsell,\nWhich is the best to furnish me to morrow\n\n   Vrsu. Shee's tane I warrant you,\nWe haue caught her Madame?\n  Hero. If it proue so, then louing goes by haps,\nSome Cupid kills with arrowes, some with traps.\nEnter.\n\n  Beat. What fire is in mine eares? can this be true?\nStand I condemn'd for pride and scorne so much?\nContempt, farewell, and maiden pride, adew,\nNo glory liues behinde the backe of such.\nAnd Benedicke, loue on, I will requite thee,\nTaming my wilde heart to thy louing hand:\nIf thou dost loue, my kindnesse shall incite thee\nTo binde our loues vp in a holy band.\nFor others say thou dost deserue, and I\nBeleeue it better then reportingly.\nEnter.\n\nEnter Prince, Claudio, Benedicke, and Leonato.\n\n  Prince. I doe but stay till your marriage be consummate,\nand then go I toward Arragon\n\n   Clau. Ile bring you thither my Lord, if you'l vouchsafe\nme\n\n   Prin. Nay, that would be as great a soyle in the new\nglosse of your marriage, as to shew a childe his new coat\nand forbid him to weare it, I will onely bee bold with\nBenedicke for his companie, for from the crowne of his\nhead, to the sole of his foot, he is all mirth, he hath twice\nor thrice cut Cupids bow-string, and the little hang-man\ndare not shoot at him, he hath a heart as sound as a bell,\nand his tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinkes,\nhis tongue speakes\n\n   Bene. Gallants, I am not as I haue bin\n\n   Leo. So say I, methinkes you are sadder\n\n   Claud. I hope he be in loue\n\n   Prin. Hang him truant, there's no true drop of bloud\nin him to be truly toucht with loue, if he be sad, he wants\nmoney\n\n   Bene. I haue the tooth-ach\n\n   Prin. Draw it\n\n   Bene. Hang it\n\n   Claud. You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards\n\n   Prin. What? sigh for the tooth-ach\n\n   Leon. Where is but a humour or a worme\n\n   Bene. Well, euery one cannot master a griefe, but hee\nthat has it\n\n   Clau. Yet say I, he is in loue\n\n   Prin. There is no appearance of fancie in him, vnlesse\nit be a fancy that he hath to strange disguises, as to bee a\nDutchman to day, a Frenchman to morrow: vnlesse hee\nhaue a fancy to this foolery, as it appeares hee hath, hee\nis no foole for fancy, as you would haue it to appeare\nhe is\n\n   Clau. If he be not in loue with some woman, there\nis no beleeuing old signes, a brushes his hat a mornings,\nWhat should that bode?\n  Prin. Hath any man seene him at the Barbers?\n  Clau. No, but the Barbers man hath beene seen with\nhim, and the olde ornament of his cheeke hath alreadie\nstuft tennis balls\n\n   Leon. Indeed he lookes yonger than hee did, by the\nlosse of a beard\n\n   Prin. Nay a rubs himselfe with Ciuit, can you smell\nhim out by that?\n  Clau. That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in\nloue\n\n   Prin. The greatest note of it is his melancholy\n\n   Clau. And when was he wont to wash his face?\n  Prin. Yea, or to paint himselfe? for the which I heare\nwhat they say of him\n\n   Clau. Nay, but his iesting spirit, which is now crept\ninto a lute-string, and now gouern'd by stops\n\n   Prin. Indeed that tels a heauy tale for him: conclude,\nhe is in loue\n\n   Clau. Nay, but I know who loues him\n\n   Prince. That would I know too, I warrant one that\nknowes him not\n\n   Cla. Yes, and his ill conditions, and in despight of all,\ndies for him\n\n   Prin. Shee shall be buried with her face vpwards\n\n   Bene. Yet is this no charme for the tooth-ake, old signior,\nwalke aside with mee, I haue studied eight or nine\nwise words to speake to you, which these hobby-horses\nmust not heare\n\n   Prin. For my life to breake with him about Beatrice\n\n   Clau. 'Tis euen so, Hero and Margaret haue by this\nplayed their parts with Beatrice, and then the two Beares\nwill not bite one another when they meete.\nEnter Iohn the Bastard.\n\n  Bast. My Lord and brother, God saue you\n\n   Prin. Good den brother\n\n   Bast. If your leisure seru'd, I would speake with you\n\n   Prince. In priuate?\n  Bast. If it please you, yet Count Claudio may heare,\nfor what I would speake of, concernes him\n\n   Prin. What's the matter?\n  Basta. Meanes your Lordship to be married to morrow?\n  Prin. You know he does\n\n   Bast. I know not that when he knowes what I know\n\n   Clau. If there be any impediment, I pray you discouer\nit\n\n   Bast. You may thinke I loue you not, let that appeare\nhereafter, and ayme better at me by that I now will manifest,\nfor my brother (I thinke, he holds you well, and in\ndearenesse of heart) hath holpe to effect your ensuing\nmarriage: surely sute ill spent, and labour ill bestowed\n\n   Prin. Why, what's the matter?\n  Bastard. I came hither to tell you, and circumstances\nshortned, (for she hath beene too long a talking of) the\nLady is disloyall\n\n   Clau. Who Hero?\n  Bast. Euen shee, Leonatoes Hero, your Hero, euery\nmans Hero\n\n   Clau. Disloyall?\n  Bast. The word is too good to paint out her wickednesse,\nI could say she were worse, thinke you of a worse\ntitle, and I will fit her to it: wonder not till further warrant:\ngoe but with mee to night, you shal see her chamber\nwindow entred, euen the night before her wedding\nday, if you loue her, then to morrow wed her: But it\nwould better fit your honour to change your minde\n\n   Claud. May this be so?\n  Princ. I will not thinke it\n\n   Bast. If you dare not trust that you see, confesse not\nthat you know: if you will follow mee, I will shew you\nenough, and when you haue seene more, & heard more,\nproceed accordingly\n\n   Clau. If I see any thing to night, why I should not\nmarry her to morrow in the congregation, where I shold\nwedde, there will I shame her\n\n   Prin. And as I wooed for thee to obtaine her, I will\nioyne with thee to disgrace her\n\n   Bast. I will disparage her no farther, till you are my\nwitnesses, beare it coldly but till night, and let the issue\nshew it selfe\n\n   Prin. O day vntowardly turned!\n  Claud. O mischiefe strangelie thwarting!\n  Bastard. O plague right well preuented! so will you\nsay, when you haue seene the sequele.\nEnter.\n\nEnter Dogbery and his compartner with the watch.\n\n  Dog. Are you good men and true?\n  Verg. Yea, or else it were pitty but they should suffer\nsaluation body and soule\n\n   Dogb. Nay, that were a punishment too good for\nthem, if they should haue any allegiance in them, being\nchosen for the Princes watch\n\n   Verges. Well, giue them their charge, neighbour\nDogbery\n\n   Dog. First, who thinke you the most desartlesse man\nto be Constable\n\n   Watch.1. Hugh Ote-cake sir, or George Sea-coale, for\nthey can write and reade\n\n   Dogb. Come hither neighbour Sea-coale, God hath\nblest you with a good name: to be a wel-fauoured man,\nis the gift of Fortune, but to write and reade, comes by\nNature\n\n   Watch 2. Both which Master Constable\n  Dogb. You haue: I knew it would be your answere:\nwell, for your fauour sir, why giue God thankes, & make\nno boast of it, and for your writing and reading, let that\nappeare when there is no need of such vanity, you are\nthought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man for the\nConstable of the watch: therefore beare you the lanthorne:\nthis is your charge: You shall comprehend all\nvagrom men, you are to bid any man stand in the Princes\nname\n\n   Watch 2. How if a will not stand?\n  Dogb. Why then take no note of him, but let him go,\nand presently call the rest of the Watch together, and\nthanke God you are ridde of a knaue\n\n   Verges. If he will not stand when he is bidden, hee is\nnone of the Princes subiects\n\n   Dogb. True, and they are to meddle with none but\nthe Princes subiects: you shall also make no noise in the\nstreetes: for, for the Watch to babble and talke, is most\ntollerable, and not to be indured\n\n   Watch. We will rather sleepe than talke, wee know\nwhat belongs to a Watch\n\n   Dog. Why you speake like an ancient and most quiet\nwatchman, for I cannot see how sleeping should offend:\nonly haue a care that your bills be not stolne: well, you\nare to call at all the Alehouses, and bid them that are\ndrunke get them to bed\n\n   Watch. How if they will not?\n  Dogb. Why then let them alone till they are sober, if\nthey make you not then the better answere, you may say,\nthey are not the men you tooke them for\n\n   Watch. Well sir,\n  Dogb. If you meet a theefe, you may suspect him, by\nvertue of your office, to be no true man: and for such\nkinde of men, the lesse you meddle or make with them,\nwhy the more is for your honesty\n\n   Watch. If wee know him to be a thiefe, shall wee not\nlay hands on him\n\n   Dogb. Truly by your office you may, but I think they\nthat touch pitch will be defil'd: the most peaceable way\nfor you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him shew himselfe\nwhat he is, and steale out of your company\n\n   Ver. You haue bin alwaies cal'd a merciful ma[n] partner\n\n   Dog. Truely I would not hang a dog by my will, much\nmore a man who hath anie honestie in him\n\n   Verges. If you heare a child crie in the night you must\ncall to the nurse, and bid her still it\n\n   Watch. How if the nurse be asleepe and will not\nheare vs?\n  Dog. Why then depart in peace, and let the childe\nwake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare\nher Lambe when it baes, will neuer answere a calfe when\nhe bleates\n\n   Verges. 'Tis verie true\n\n   Dog. This is the end of the charge: you constable\nare to present the Princes owne person, if you meete the\nPrince in the night, you may staie him\n\n   Verges. Nay birladie that I thinke a cannot\n\n   Dog. Fiue shillings to one on't with anie man that\nknowes the Statutes, he may staie him, marrie not without\nthe prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to\noffend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against\nhis will\n\n   Verges. Birladie I thinke it be so\n\n   Dog. Ha, ah ha, well masters good night, and there be\nanie matter of weight chances, call vp me, keepe your\nfellowes counsailes, and your owne, and good night,\ncome neighbour\n\n   Watch. Well masters, we heare our charge, let vs go\nsit here vpon the Church bench till two, and then all to\nbed\n\n   Dog. One word more, honest neighbors. I pray you\nwatch about signior Leonatoes doore, for the wedding being\nthere to morrow, there is a great coyle to night,\nadiew, be vigitant I beseech you.\n\nExeunt.\n\nEnter Borachio and Conrade.\n\n  Bor. What, Conrade?\n  Watch. Peace, stir not\n\n   Bor. Conrade I say\n\n   Con. Here man, I am at thy elbow\n\n   Bor. Mas and my elbow itcht, I thought there would\na scabbe follow\n\n   Con. I will owe thee an answere for that, and now\nforward with thy tale\n\n   Bor. Stand thee close then vnder this penthouse, for it\ndrissels raine, and I will, like a true drunkard, vtter all to\nthee\n\n   Watch. Some treason masters, yet stand close\n\n   Bor. Therefore know, I haue earned of Don Iohn a\nthousand Ducates\n\n   Con. Is it possible that anie villanie should be so deare?\n  Bor. Thou should'st rather aske if it were possible anie\nvillanie should be so rich? for when rich villains haue\nneede of poore ones, poore ones may make what price\nthey will\n\n   Con. I wonder at it\n\n   Bor. That shewes thou art vnconfirm'd, thou knowest\nthat the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloake, is nothing\nto a man\n\n   Con. Yes, it is apparell\n\n   Bor. I meane the fashion\n\n   Con. Yes the fashion is the fashion\n\n   Bor. Tush, I may as well say the foole's the foole, but\nseest thou not what a deformed theefe this fashion is?\n  Watch. I know that deformed, a has bin a vile theefe,\nthis vii. yeares, a goes vp and downe like a gentle man:\nI remember his name\n\n   Bor. Did'st thou not heare some bodie?\n  Con. No, 'twas the vaine on the house\n\n   Bor. Seest thou not (I say) what a deformed thiefe\nthis fashion is, how giddily a turnes about all the Hotblouds,\nbetweene, foureteene & fiue & thirtie, sometimes\nfashioning them like Pharaoes souldiours in the rechie\npainting, sometime like god Bels priests in the old\nChurch window, sometime like the shauen Hercules in\nthe smircht worm-eaten tapestrie, where his cod-peece\nseemes as massie as his club\n\n   Con. All this I see, and see that the fashion weares out\nmore apparrell then the man; but art not thou thy selfe\ngiddie with the fashion too that thou hast shifted out of\nthy tale into telling me of the fashion?\n  Bor. Not so neither, but know that I haue to night\nwooed Margaret the Lady Heroes gentle-woman, by the\nname of Hero, she leanes me out at her mistris chamberwindow,\nbids me a thousand times good night: I tell\nthis tale vildly. I should first tell thee how the Prince\nClaudio and my Master planted, and placed, and possessed\nby my Master Don Iohn, saw a far off in the Orchard this\namiable incounter\n\n   Con. And thought thy Margaret was Hero?\n  Bor. Two of them did, the Prince and Claudio, but the\ndiuell my Master knew she was Margaret and partly by\nhis oathes, which first possest them, partly by the darke\nnight which did deceiue them, but chiefely, by my villanie,\nwhich did confirme any slander that Don Iohn had\nmade, away went Claudio enraged, swore hee would\nmeete her as he was apointed next morning at the Temple,\nand there, before the whole congregation shame her\nwith what he saw o're night, and send her home againe\nwithout a husband\n\n   Watch.1. We charge you in the Princes name stand\n\n   Watch.2. Call vp the right master Constable, we haue\nhere recouered the most dangerous peece of lechery, that\neuer was knowne in the Common-wealth\n\n   Watch.1. And one Deformed is one of them, I know\nhim, a weares a locke\n\n   Conr. Masters, masters\n\n   Watch.2. Youle be made bring deformed forth I warrant\nyou,\n  Conr. Masters, neuer speake, we charge you, let vs obey\nyou to goe with vs\n\n   Bor. We are like to proue a goodly commoditie, being\ntaken vp of these mens bils\n\n   Conr. A commoditie in question I warrant you, come\nweele obey you.\n\nExeunt.\n\nEnter Hero, and Margaret, and Vrsula.\n\n  Hero. Good Vrsula wake my cosin Beatrice, and desire\nher to rise\n\n   Vrsu. I will Lady\n\n   Her. And bid her come hither\n\n   Vrs. Well\n\n   Mar. Troth I thinke your other rebato were better\n\n   Hero. No pray thee good Meg, Ile weare this\n\n   Marg. By my troth's not so good, and I warrant your\ncosin will say so\n\n   Hero. My cosin's a foole, and thou art another, ile\nweare none but this\n\n   Mar. I like the new tire within excellently, if the\nhaire were a thought browner: and your gown's a most\nrare fashion yfaith, I saw the Dutchesse of Millaines\ngowne that they praise so\n\n   Hero. O that exceedes they say\n\n   Mar. By my troth's but a night-gowne in respect of\nyours, cloth a gold and cuts, and lac'd with siluer, set with\npearles, downe sleeues, side sleeues, and skirts, round vnderborn\nwith a blewish tinsel, but for a fine queint gracefull\nand excellent fashion, yours is worth ten on't\n\n   Hero. God giue mee ioy to weare it, for my heart is\nexceeding heauy\n\n   Marga. 'Twill be heauier soone, by the waight of a\nman\n\n   Hero. Fie vpon thee, art not asham'd?\n  Marg. Of what Lady? of speaking honourably? is\nnot marriage honourable in a beggar? is not your Lord\nhonourable without marriage? I thinke you would haue\nme say, sauing your reuerence a husband: and bad thinking\ndoe not wrest true speaking, Ile offend no body, is\nthere any harme in the heauier for a husband? none I\nthinke, and it be the right husband, and the right wife,\notherwise 'tis light and not heauy, aske my Lady Beatrice\nelse, here she comes.\nEnter Beatrice.\n\n  Hero. Good morrow Coze\n\n   Beat. Good morrow sweet Hero\n\n   Hero. Why how now? do you speake in the sick tune?\n  Beat. I am out of all other tune, me thinkes\n\n   Mar. Claps into Light a loue, (that goes without a\nburden,) do you sing it and Ile dance it\n\n   Beat. Ye Light aloue with your heeles, then if your\nhusband haue stables enough, you'll looke he shall lacke\nno barnes\n\n   Mar. O illegitimate construction! I scorne that with\nmy heeles\n\n   Beat. 'Tis almost fiue a clocke cosin, 'tis time you\nwere ready, by my troth I am exceeding ill, hey ho\n\n   Mar. For a hauke, a horse, or a husband?\n  Beat. For the letter that begins them all, H\n\n   Mar. Well, and you be not turn'd Turke, there's no\nmore sayling by the starre\n\n   Beat. What meanes the foole trow?\n  Mar. Nothing I, but God send euery one their harts\ndesire\n\n   Hero. These gloues the Count sent mee, they are an\nexcellent perfume\n\n   Beat. I am stuft cosin, I cannot smell\n\n   Mar. A maid and stuft! there's goodly catching of\ncolde\n\n   Beat. O God helpe me, God help me, how long haue\nyou profest apprehension?\n  Mar. Euer since you left it, doth not my wit become\nme rarely?\n  Beat. It is not seene enough, you should weare it in\nyour cap, by my troth I am sicke\n\n   Mar. Get you some of this distill'd carduus benedictus\nand lay it to your heart, it is the onely thing for a qualm\n\n   Hero. There thou prick'st her with a thissell\n\n   Beat.

Come Frier Francis, be briefe, onely to the\nplaine forme of marriage, and you shal recount their particular\nduties afterwards\n\n   Fran. You come hither, my Lord, to marry this Lady\n\n   Clau. No\n\n   Leo. To be married to her: Frier, you come to marrie\nher\n\n   Frier. Lady, you come hither to be married to this\nCount\n\n   Hero. I doe\n\n   Frier. If either of you know any inward impediment\nwhy you should not be conioyned, I charge you on your\nsoules to vtter it\n\n   Claud. Know you anie, Hero?\n  Hero. None my Lord\n\n   Frier. Know you anie, Count?\n  Leon. I dare make his answer, None\n\n   Clau. O what men dare do! what men may do! what\nmen daily do!\n  Bene. How now! interiections? why then, some be\nof laughing, as ha, ha, he\n\n   Clau. Stand thee by Frier, father, by your leaue,\nWill you with free and vnconstrained soule\nGiue me this maid your daughter?\n  Leon. As freely sonne as God did giue her me\n\n   Cla. And what haue I to giue you back, whose worth\nMay counterpoise this rich and precious gift?\n  Prin. Nothing, vnlesse you render her againe\n\n   Clau. Sweet Prince, you learn me noble thankfulnes:\nThere Leonato, take her backe againe,\nGiue not this rotten Orenge to your friend,\nShee's but the signe and semblance of her honour:\nBehold how like a maid she blushes heere!\nO what authoritie and shew of truth\nCan cunning sinne couer it selfe withall!\nComes not that bloud, as modest euidence,\nTo witnesse simple Vertue? would you not sweare\nAll you that see her, that she were a maide,\nBy these exterior shewes? But she is none:\nShe knowes the heat of a luxurious bed:\nHer blush is guiltinesse, not modestie\n\n   Leonato. What doe you meane, my Lord?\n  Clau. Not to be married,\nNot to knit my soule to an approued wanton\n\n   Leon. Deere my Lord, if you in your owne proofe,\nHaue vanquisht the resistance of her youth,\nAnd made defeat of her virginitie\n\n   Clau. I know what you would say: if I haue knowne\n(her,\nYou will say, she did imbrace me as a husband,\nAnd so extenuate the forehand sinne: No Leonato,\nI neuer tempted her with word too large,\nBut as a brother to his sister, shewed\nBashfull sinceritie and comely loue\n\n   Hero. And seem'd I euer otherwise to you?\n  Clau. Out on thee seeming, I will write against it,\nYou seeme to me as Diane in her Orbe,\nAs chaste as is the budde ere it be blowne:\nBut you are more intemperate in your blood,\nThan Venus, or those pampred animalls,\nThat rage in sauage sensualitie\n\n   Hero. Is my Lord well, that he doth speake so wide?\n  Leon. Sweete Prince, why speake not you?\n  Prin. What should I speake?\nI stand dishonour'd that haue gone about,\nTo linke my deare friend to a common stale\n\n   Leon. Are these things spoken, or doe I but dreame?\n  Bast. Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true\n\n   Bene. This lookes not like a nuptiall\n\n   Hero. True, O God!\n  Clau. Leonato, stand I here?\nIs this the Prince? is this the Princes brother?\nIs this face Heroes? are our eies our owne?\n  Leon. All this is so, but what of this my Lord?\n  Clau. Let me but moue one question to your daughter,\nAnd by that fatherly and kindly power,\nThat you haue in her, bid her answer truly\n\n   Leo. I charge thee doe, as thou art my childe\n\n   Hero. O God defend me how am I beset,\nWhat kinde of catechizing call you this?\n  Clau. To make you answer truly to your name\n\n   Hero. Is it not Hero? who can blot that name\nWith any iust reproach?\n  Claud. Marry that can Hero,\nHero it selfe can blot out Heroes vertue.\nWhat man was he, talkt with you yesternight,\nOut at your window betwixt twelue and one?\nNow if you are a maid, answer to this\n\n   Hero. I talkt with no man at that howre my Lord\n\n   Prince. Why then you are no maiden. Leonato,\nI am sorry you must heare: vpon mine honor,\nMy selfe, my brother, and this grieued Count\nDid see her, heare her, at that howre last night,\nTalke with a ruffian at her chamber window,\nWho hath indeed most like a liberall villaine,\nConfest the vile encounters they haue had\nA thousand times in secret\n\n   Iohn. Fie, fie, they are not to be named my Lord,\nNot to be spoken of,\nThere is not chastitie enough in language,\nWithout offence to vtter them: thus pretty Lady\nI am sorry for thy much misgouernment\n\n   Claud. O Hero! what a Hero hadst thou beene\nIf halfe thy outward graces had beene placed\nAbout thy thoughts and counsailes of thy heart?\nBut fare thee well, most foule, most faire, farewell\nThou pure impiety, and impious puritie,\nFor thee Ile locke vp all the gates of Loue,\nAnd on my eie-lids shall Coniecture hang,\nTo turne all beauty into thoughts of harme,\nAnd neuer shall it more be gracious\n\n   Leon. Hath no mans dagger here a point for me?\n  Beat. Why how now cosin, wherfore sink you down?\n  Bast. Come, let vs go: these things come thus to light,\nSmother her spirits vp\n\n   Bene. How doth the Lady?\n  Beat. Dead I thinke, helpe vncle,\nHero, why Hero, Vncle, Signor Benedicke, Frier\n\n   Leonato. O Fate! take not away thy heauy hand,\nDeath is the fairest couer for her shame\nThat may be wisht for\n\n   Beatr. How now cosin Hero?\n  Fri. Haue comfort Ladie\n\n   Leon. Dost thou looke vp?\n  Frier. Yea, wherefore should she not?\n  Leon. Wherfore? Why doth not euery earthly thing\nCry shame vpon her? Could she heere denie\nThe storie that is printed in her blood?\nDo not liue Hero, do not ope thine eyes:\nFor did I thinke thou wouldst not quickly die,\nThought I thy spirits were stronger then thy shames,\nMy selfe would on the reward of reproaches\nStrike at thy life. Grieu'd I, I had but one?\nChid I, for that at frugal Natures frame?\nO one too much by thee: why had I one?\nWhy euer was't thou louelie in my eies?\nWhy had I not with charitable hand\nTooke vp a beggars issue at my gates,\nWho smeered thus, and mir'd with infamie,\nI might haue said, no part of it is mine:\nThis shame deriues it selfe from vnknowne loines,\nBut mine, and mine I lou'd, and mine I prais'd,\nAnd mine that I was proud on mine so much,\nThat I my selfe, was to my selfe not mine:\nValewing of her, why she, O she is falne\nInto a pit of Inke, that the wide sea\nHath drops too few to wash her cleane againe,\nAnd salt too little, which may season giue\nTo her foule tainted flesh\n\n   Ben. Sir, sir, be patient: for my part, I am so attired\nin wonder, I know not what to say\n\n   Bea. O on my soule my cosin is belied\n\n   Ben. Ladie, were you her bedfellow last night?\n  Bea. No, truly: not although vntill last night,\nI haue this tweluemonth bin her bedfellow\n\n   Leon. Confirm'd, confirm'd, O that is stronger made\nWhich was before barr'd vp with ribs of iron.\nWould the Princes lie, and Claudio lie,\nWho lou'd her so, that speaking of her foulnesse,\nWash'd it with teares? Hence from her, let her die\n\n   Fri. Heare me a little, for I haue onely bene silent so\nlong, and giuen way vnto this course of fortune, by noting\nof the Ladie, I haue markt.\nA thousand blushing apparitions,\nTo start into her face, a thousand innocent shames,\nIn Angel whitenesse beare away those blushes,\nAnd in her eie there hath appear'd a fire\nTo burne the errors that these Princes hold\nAgainst her maiden truth. Call me a foole,\nTrust not my reading, nor my obseruations,\nWhich with experimental seale doth warrant\nThe tenure of my booke: trust not my age,\nMy reuerence, calling, nor diuinitie,\nIf this sweet Ladie lye not guiltlesse heere,\nVnder some biting error\n\n   Leo. Friar, it cannot be:\nThou seest that all the Grace that she hath left,\nIs, that she wil not adde to her damnation,\nA sinne of periury, she not denies it:\nWhy seek'st thou then to couer with excuse,\nThat which appeares in proper nakednesse?\n  Fri. Ladie, what man is he you are accus'd of?\n  Hero. They know that do accuse me, I know none:\nIf I know more of any man aliue\nThen that which maiden modestie doth warrant,\nLet all my sinnes lacke mercy. O my Father,\nProue you that any man with me conuerst,\nAt houres vnmeete, or that I yesternight\nMaintain'd the change of words with any creature,\nRefuse me, hate me, torture me to death\n\n   Fri. There is some strange misprision in the Princes\n\n   Ben. Two of them haue the verie bent of honor,\nAnd if their wisedomes be misled in this:\nThe practise of it liues in Iohn the bastard,\nWhose spirits toile in frame of villanies\n\n   Leo. I know not: if they speake but truth of her,\nThese hands shall teare her: If they wrong her honour,\nThe proudest of them shall wel heare of it.\nTime hath not yet so dried this bloud of mine,\nNor age so eate vp my inuention,\nNor Fortune made such hauocke of my meanes,\nNor my bad life reft me so much of friends,\nBut they shall finde, awak'd in such a kinde,\nBoth strength of limbe, and policie of minde,\nAbility in meanes, and choise of friends,\nTo quit me of them throughly\n\n   Fri. Pause awhile:\nAnd let my counsell sway you in this case,\nYour daughter heere the Princesse (left for dead)\nLet her awhile be secretly kept in,\nAnd publish it, that she is dead indeed:\nMaintaine a mourning ostentation,\nAnd on your Families old monument,\nHang mournfull Epitaphes, and do all rites,\nThat appertaine vnto a buriall\n\n   Leon. What shall become of this? What wil this do?\n  Fri. Marry this wel carried, shall on her behalfe,\nChange slander to remorse, that is some good,\nBut not for that dreame I on this strange course,\nBut on this trauaile looke for greater birth:\nShe dying, as it must be so maintain'd,\nVpon the instant that she was accus'd,\nShal be lamented, pittied, and excus'd\nOf euery hearer: for it so fals out,\nThat what we haue, we prize not to the worth,\nWhiles we enioy it; but being lack'd and lost,\nWhy then we racke the value, then we finde\nThe vertue that possession would not shew vs\nWhiles it was ours, so will it fare with Claudio:\nWhen he shal heare she dyed vpon his words,\nTh' Idea of her life shal sweetly creepe\nInto his study of imagination.\nAnd euery louely Organ of her life,\nShall come apparel'd in more precious habite:\nMore mouing delicate, and ful of life,\nInto the eye and prospect of his soule\nThen when she liu'd indeed: then shal he mourne,\nIf euer Loue had interest in his Liuer,\nAnd wish he had not so accused her:\nNo, though he thought his accusation true:\nLet this be so, and doubt not but successe\nWil fashion the euent in better shape,\nThen I can lay it downe in likelihood.\nBut if all ayme but this be leuelld false,\nThe supposition of the Ladies death,\nWill quench the wonder of her infamie.\nAnd if it sort not well, you may conceale her\nAs best befits her wounded reputation,\nIn some reclusiue and religious life,\nOut of all eyes, tongues, mindes and iniuries\n\n   Bene. Signior Leonato, let the Frier aduise you,\nAnd though you know my inwardnesse and loue\nIs very much vnto the Prince and Claudio.\nYet, by mine honor, I will deale in this,\nAs secretly and iustlie, as your soule\nShould with your bodie\n\n   Leon. Being that I flow in greefe,\nThe smallest twine may lead me\n\n   Frier. 'Tis well consented, presently away,\nFor to strange sores, strangely they straine the cure,\nCome Lady, die to liue, this wedding day\nPerhaps is but prolong'd, haue patience & endure.\nEnter.\n\n  Bene. Lady Beatrice, haue you wept all this while?\n  Beat. Yea, and I will weepe a while longer\n\n   Bene. I will not desire that\n\n   Beat. You haue no reason, I doe it freely\n\n   Bene. Surelie I do beleeue your fair cosin is wrong'd\n\n   Beat. Ah, how much might the man deserue of mee\nthat would right her!\n  Bene. Is there any way to shew such friendship?\n  Beat. A verie euen way, but no such friend\n\n   Bene. May a man doe it?\n  Beat. It is a mans office, but not yours\n\n   Bene. I doe loue nothing in the world so well as you,\nis not that strange?\n  Beat. As strange as the thing I know not, it were as\npossible for me to say, I loued nothing so well as you, but\nbeleeue me not, and yet I lie not, I confesse nothing, nor\nI deny nothing, I am sorry for my cousin\n\n   Bene. By my sword Beatrice thou lou'st me\n\n   Beat. Doe not sweare by it and eat it\n\n   Bene. I will sweare by it that you loue mee, and I will\nmake him eat it that sayes I loue not you\n\n   Beat. Will you not eat your word?\n  Bene. With no sawce that can be deuised to it, I protest\nI loue thee\n\n   Beat. Why then God forgiue me\n\n   Bene. What offence sweet Beatrice?\n  Beat. You haue stayed me in a happy howre, I was about\nto protest I loued you\n\n   Bene. And doe it with all thy heart\n\n   Beat. I loue you with so much of my heart, that none\nis left to protest\n\n   Bened. Come, bid me doe any thing for thee\n\n   Beat. Kill Claudio\n\n   Bene. Ha, not for the wide world\n\n   Beat. You kill me to denie, farewell\n\n   Bene. Tarrie sweet Beatrice\n\n   Beat. I am gone, though I am heere, there is no loue\nin you, nay I pray you let me goe\n\n   Bene. Beatrice\n\n   Beat. Infaith I will goe\n\n   Bene. Wee'll be friends first\n\n   Beat. You dare easier be friends with mee, than fight\nwith mine enemy\n\n   Bene. Is Claudio thine enemie?\n  Beat. Is a not approued in the height a villaine, that\nhath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O\nthat I were a man! what, beare her in hand vntill they\ncome to take hands, and then with publike accusation\nvncouered slander, vnmittigated rancour? O God that I\nwere a man! I would eat his heart in the market-place\n\n   Bene. Heare me Beatrice\n\n   Beat. Talke with a man out at a window, a proper\nsaying\n\n   Bene. Nay but Beatrice\n\n   Beat. Sweet Hero, she is wrong'd, shee is slandered,\nshe is vndone\n\n   Bene. Beat?\n  Beat. Princes and Counties! surelie a Princely testimonie,\na goodly Count, Comfect, a sweet Gallant surelie,\nO that I were a man for his sake! or that I had any\nfriend would be a man for my sake! But manhood is melted\ninto cursies, valour into complement, and men are\nonelie turned into tongue, and trim ones too: he is now\nas valiant as Hercules, that only tells a lie, and sweares it:\nI cannot be a man with wishing, therfore I will die a woman\nwith grieuing\n\n   Bene.

Yea, as sure as I haue a thought, or a soule\n\n   Bene. Enough, I am engagde, I will challenge him, I\nwill kisse your hand, and so leaue you: by this hand Claudio\nshall render me a deere account: as you heare of me,\nso thinke of me: goe comfort your coosin, I must say she\nis dead, and so farewell.\nEnter the Constables, Borachio, and the Towne Clerke in gownes.\n\n  Keeper.

My Lord, my Lord,\nIle proue it on his body if he dare,\nDespight his nice fence, and his actiue practise,\nHis Maie of youth, and bloome of lustihood\n\n   Claud. Away, I will not haue to do with you\n\n   Leo. Canst thou so daffe me? thou hast kild my child,\nIf thou kilst me, boy, thou shalt kill a man\n\n   Bro. He shall kill two of vs, and men indeed,\nBut that's no matter, let him kill one first:\nWin me and weare me, let him answere me,\nCome follow me boy, come sir boy, come follow me\nSir boy, ile whip you from your foyning fence,\nNay, as I am a gentleman, I will\n\n   Leon.

Brother Anthony\n\n   Brot. Hold you content, what man? I know them, yea\nAnd what they weigh, euen to the vtmost scruple,\nScambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boyes,\nThat lye, and cog, and flout, depraue, and slander,\nGoe antiquely, and show outward hidiousnesse,\nAnd speake of halfe a dozen dang'rous words,\nHow they might hurt their enemies, if they durst.\nAnd this is all\n\n   Leon. But brother Anthonie\n\n   Ant. Come, 'tis no matter,\nDo not you meddle, let me deale in this\n\n   Pri. Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience\nMy heart is sorry for your daughters death:\nBut on my honour she was charg'd with nothing\nBut what was true, and very full of proofe\n\n   Leon.

And shall, or some of vs will smart for it\n\n   Prin. See, see, here comes the man we went to seeke\n\n   Clau. Now signior, what newes?\n  Ben. Good day my Lord\n\n   Prin. Welcome signior, you are almost come to part\nalmost a fray\n\n   Clau. Wee had likt to haue had our two noses snapt\noff with two old men without teeth\n\n   Prin. Leonato and his brother, what think'st thou? had\nwee fought, I doubt we should haue beene too yong for\nthem\n\n   Ben. In a false quarrell there is no true valour, I came\nto seeke you both\n\n   Clau. We haue beene vp and downe to seeke thee, for\nwe are high proofe melancholly, and would faine haue it\nbeaten away, wilt thou vse thy wit?\n  Ben. It is in my scabberd, shall I draw it?\n  Prin. Doest thou weare thy wit by thy side?\n  Clau. Neuer any did so, though verie many haue been\nbeside their wit, I will bid thee drawe, as we do the minstrels,\ndraw to pleasure vs\n\n   Prin. As I am an honest man he lookes pale, art thou\nsicke, or angrie?\n  Clau. What, courage man: what though care kil'd a\ncat, thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care\n\n   Ben. Sir, I shall meete your wit in the careere, and\nyou charge it against me, I pray you chuse another subiect\n\n   Clau. Nay then giue him another staffe, this last was\nbroke crosse\n\n   Prin. By this light, he changes more and more, I thinke\nhe be angrie indeede\n\n   Clau. If he be, he knowes how to turne his girdle\n\n   Ben. Shall I speake a word in your eare?\n  Clau. God blesse me from a challenge\n\n   Ben. You are a villaine, I iest not, I will make it good\nhow you dare, with what you dare, and when you dare:\ndo me right, or I will protest your cowardise: you haue\nkill'd a sweete Ladie, and her death shall fall heauie on\nyou, let me heare from you\n\n   Clau. Well, I will meete you, so I may haue good\ncheare\n\n   Prin. What, a feast, a feast?\n  Clau. I faith I thanke him, he hath bid me to a calues\nhead and a Capon, the which if I doe not carue most curiously,\nsay my knife's naught, shall I not finde a woodcocke\ntoo?\n  Ben. Sir, your wit ambles well, it goes easily\n\n   Prin. Ile tell thee how Beatrice prais'd thy wit the other\nday: I said thou hadst a fine wit: true saies she, a fine\nlittle one: no said I, a great wit: right saies shee, a great\ngrosse one: nay said I, a good wit: iust said she, it hurts\nno body: nay said I, the gentleman is wise: certaine said\nshe, a wise gentleman: nay said I, he hath the tongues:\nthat I beleeue said shee, for hee swore a thing to me on\nmunday night, which he forswore on tuesday morning:\nthere's a double tongue, there's two tongues: thus did\nshee an howre together trans-shape thy particular vertues,\nyet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou wast the\nproprest man in Italie\n\n   Claud. For the which she wept heartily, and said shee\ncar'd not\n\n   Prin. Yea that she did, but yet for all that, and if shee\ndid not hate him deadlie, shee would loue him dearely,\nthe old mans daughter told vs all\n\n   Clau. All, all, and moreouer, God saw him when he\nwas hid in the garden\n\n   Prin. But when shall we set the sauage Bulls hornes\non the sensible Benedicks head?\n  Clau. Yea and text vnderneath, heere dwells Benedicke\nthe married man\n\n   Ben. Fare you well, Boy, you know my minde, I will\nleaue you now to your gossep-like humor, you breake\niests as braggards do their blades, which God be thanked\nhurt not: my Lord, for your manie courtesies I thank\nyou, I must discontinue your companie, your brother\nthe Bastard is fled from Messina: you haue among you,\nkill'd a sweet and innocent Ladie: for my Lord Lackebeard\nthere, he and I shall meete, and till then peace be\nwith him\n\n   Prin. He is in earnest\n\n   Clau. In most profound earnest, and Ile warrant you,\nfor the loue of Beatrice\n\n   Prin. And hath challeng'd thee\n\n   Clau. Most sincerely\n\n   Prin. What a prettie thing man is, when he goes in his\ndoublet and hose, and leaues off his wit.\nEnter Constable, Conrade, and Borachio.\n\n  Clau. He is then a Giant to an Ape, but then is an Ape\na Doctor to such a man\n\n   Prin. But soft you, let me be, plucke vp my heart, and\nbe sad, did he not say my brother was fled?\n  Const. Come you sir, if iustice cannot tame you, shee\nshall nere weigh more reasons in her ballance, nay, and\nyou be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be lookt to\n\n   Prin. How now, two of my brothers men bound? Borachio\none\n\n   Clau. Harken after their offence my Lord\n\n   Prin. Officers, what offence haue these men done?\n  Const. Marrie sir, they haue committed false report,\nmoreouer they haue spoken vntruths, secondarily they\nare slanders, sixt and lastly, they haue belyed a Ladie,\nthirdly, they haue verified vniust things, and to conclude\nthey are lying knaues\n\n   Prin. First I aske thee what they haue done, thirdlie\nI aske thee what's their offence, sixt and lastlie why they\nare committed, and to conclude, what you lay to their\ncharge\n\n   Clau. Rightlie reasoned, and in his owne diuision, and\nby my troth there's one meaning well suted\n\n   Prin. Who haue you offended masters, that you are\nthus bound to your answer? this learned Constable is too\ncunning to be vnderstood, what's your offence?\n  Bor. Sweete Prince, let me go no farther to mine answere:\ndo you heare me, and let this Count kill mee: I\nhaue deceiued euen your verie eies: what your wisedomes\ncould not discouer, these shallow fooles haue\nbrought to light, who in the night ouerheard me confessing\nto this man, how Don Iohn your brother incensed\nme to slander the Ladie Hero, how you were brought\ninto the Orchard, and saw me court Margaret in Heroes\ngarments, how you disgrac'd her when you should\nmarrie her: my villanie they haue vpon record, which\nI had rather seale with my death, then repeate ouer to\nmy shame: the Ladie is dead vpon mine and my masters\nfalse accusation: and briefelie, I desire nothing but the\nreward of a villaine\n\n   Prin. Runs not this speech like yron through your\nbloud?\n  Clau. I haue drunke poison whiles he vtter'd it\n\n   Prin. But did my Brother set thee on to this?\n  Bor. Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it\n\n   Prin. He is compos'd and fram'd of treacherie,\nAnd fled he is vpon this villanie\n\n   Clau. Sweet Hero, now thy image doth appeare\nIn the rare semblance that I lou'd it first\n\n   Const. Come, bring away the plaintiffes, by this time\nour Sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:\nand masters, do not forget to specifie when time & place\nshall serue, that I am an Asse\n\n   Con.2. Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and\nthe Sexton too.\nEnter Leonato.\n\n  Leon. Which is the villaine? let me see his eies,\nThat when I note another man like him,\nI may auoide him: which of these is he?\n  Bor. If you would know your wronger, looke on me\n\n   Leon. Art thou the slaue that with thy breath\nhast kild mine innocent childe?\n  Bor. Yea, euen I alone\n\n   Leo. No, not so villaine, thou beliest thy selfe,\nHere stand a paire of honourable men,\nA third is fled that had a hand in it:\nI thanke you Princes for my daughters death,\nRecord it with your high and worthie deedes,\n'Twas brauely done, if you bethinke you of it\n\n   Clau. I know not how to pray your patience,\nYet I must speake, choose your reuenge your selfe,\nImpose me to what penance your inuention\nCan lay vpon my sinne, yet sinn'd I not,\nBut in mistaking\n\n   Prin. By my soule nor I,\nAnd yet to satisfie this good old man,\nI would bend vnder anie heauie waight,\nThat heele enioyne me to\n\n   Leon. I cannot bid you bid my daughter liue,\nThat were impossible, but I praie you both,\nPossesse the people in Messina here,\nHow innocent she died, and if your loue\nCan labour aught in sad inuention,\nHang her an epitaph vpon her toomb,\nAnd sing it to her bones, sing it to night:\nTo morrow morning come you to my house,\nAnd since you could not be my sonne in law,\nBe yet my Nephew: my brother hath a daughter,\nAlmost the copie of my childe that's dead,\nAnd she alone is heire to both of vs,\nGiue her the right you should haue giu'n her cosin,\nAnd so dies my reuenge\n\n   Clau. O noble sir!\nYour ouerkindnesse doth wring teares from me,\nI do embrace your offer, and dispose\nFor henceforth of poore Claudio\n\n   Leon. To morrow then I will expect your comming,\nTo night I take my leaue, this naughtie man\nShall face to face be brought to Margaret,\nWho I beleeue was packt in all this wrong,\nHired to it by your brother\n\n   Bor. No, by my soule she was not,\nNor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,\nBut alwaies hath bin iust and vertuous,\nIn anie thing that I do know by her\n\n   Const. Moreouer sir, which indeede is not vnder white\nand black, this plaintiffe here, the offendour did call mee\nasse, I beseech you let it be remembred in his punishment,\nand also the watch heard them talke of one Deformed,\nthey say he weares a key in his eare and a lock hanging\nby it, and borrowes monie in Gods name, the which\nhe hath vs'd so long, and neuer paied, that now men grow\nhard-harted and will lend nothing for Gods sake: praie\nyou examine him vpon that point\n\n   Leon. I thanke thee for thy care and honest paines\n\n   Const. Your worship speakes like a most thankefull\nand reuerend youth, and I praise God for you\n\n   Leon. There's for thy paines\n\n   Const. God saue the foundation\n\n   Leon. Goe, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I\nthanke thee\n\n   Const. I leaue an arrant knaue with your worship,\nwhich I beseech your worship to correct your selfe, for\nthe example of others: God keepe your worship, I\nwish your worship well, God restore you to health,\nI humblie giue you leaue to depart, and if a merrie\nmeeting may be wisht, God prohibite it: come\nneighbour\n\n   Leon. Vntill to morrow morning, Lords, farewell.\n\nExeunt.\n\n  Brot. Farewell my Lords, we looke for you to morrow\n\n   Prin. We will not faile\n\n   Clau. To night ile mourne with Hero\n\n   Leon. Bring you these fellowes on, weel talke with\nMargaret, How her acquaintance grew with this lewd\nfellow.\n\nExeunt.\n\nEnter Benedicke and Margaret.\n\n  Ben. Praie thee sweete Mistris Margaret, deserue\nwell at my hands, by helping mee to the speech of Beatrice\n\n   Mar. Will you then write me a Sonnet in praise of\nmy beautie?\n  Bene. In so high a stile Margaret, that no man liuing\nshall come ouer it, for in most comely truth thou deseruest\nit\n\n   Mar. To haue no man come ouer me, why, shall I alwaies\nkeepe below staires?\n  Bene. Thy wit is as quicke as the grey-hounds mouth,\nit catches\n\n   Mar. And yours, as blunt as the Fencers foiles, which\nhit, but hurt not\n\n   Bene. A most manly wit Margaret, it will not hurt a\nwoman: and so I pray thee call Beatrice, I giue thee the\nbucklers\n\n   Mar. Giue vs the swords, wee haue bucklers of our\nowne\n\n   Bene. If you vse them Margaret, you must put in the\npikes with a vice, and they are dangerous weapons for\nMaides\n\n   Mar. Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I thinke\nhath legges.\n\nExit Margarite.\n\n  Ben. And therefore will come. The God of loue that\nsits aboue, and knowes me, and knowes me, how pittifull\nI deserue. I meane in singing, but in louing, Leander\nthe good swimmer, Troilous the first imploier of\npandars, and a whole booke full of these quondam carpet-mongers,\nwhose name yet runne smoothly in the euen\nrode of a blanke verse, why they were neuer so truely\nturned ouer and ouer as my poore selfe in loue: marrie\nI cannot shew it rime, I haue tried, I can finde out no\nrime to Ladie but babie, an innocent rime: for scorne,\nhorne, a hard rime: for schoole foole, a babling rime:\nverie ominous endings, no, I was not borne vnder a riming\nPlannet, for I cannot wooe in festiuall tearmes:\nEnter Beatrice.\n\nsweete Beatrice would'st thou come when I cal'd\nthee?\n  Beat. Yea Signior, and depart when you bid me\n\n   Bene. O stay but till then\n\n   Beat. Then, is spoken: fare you well now, and yet ere\nI goe, let me goe with that I came, which is, with knowing\nwhat hath past betweene you and Claudio\n\n   Bene. Onely foule words, and thereupon I will kisse\nthee\n\n   Beat. Foule words is but foule wind, and foule wind\nis but foule breath, and foule breath is noisome, therefore\nI will depart vnkist\n\n   Bene. Thou hast frighted the word out of his right\nsence, so forcible is thy wit, but I must tell thee plainely,\nClaudio vndergoes my challenge, and either I must shortly\nheare from him, or I will subscribe him a coward, and\nI pray thee now tell me, for which of my bad parts didst\nthou first fall in loue with me?\n  Beat. For them all together, which maintain'd so\npolitique a state of euill, that they will not admit any\ngood part to intermingle with them: but for which of\nmy good parts did you first suffer loue for me?\n  Bene. Suffer loue! a good epithite, I do suffer loue indeede,\nfor I loue thee against my will,\n  Beat. In spight of your heart I think, alas poore heart,\nif you spight it for my sake, I will spight it for yours, for\nI will neuer loue that which my friend hates\n\n   Bened. Thou and I are too wise to wooe peaceablie\n\n   Bea. It appeares not in this confession, there's not one\nwise man among twentie that will praise himselfe\n\n   Bene. An old, an old instance Beatrice, that liu'd in\nthe time of good neighbours, if a man doe not erect in\nthis age his owne tombe ere he dies, hee shall liue no\nlonger in monuments, then the Bels ring, & the Widdow\nweepes\n\n   Beat. And how long is that thinke you?\n  Ben. Question, why an hower in clamour and a quarter\nin rhewme, therfore is it most expedient for the wise,\nif Don worme (his conscience) finde no impediment to\nthe contrarie, to be the trumpet of his owne vertues, as\nI am to my selfe so much for praising my selfe, who I my\nselfe will beare witnesse is praise worthie, and now tell\nme, how doth your cosin?\n  Beat. Verie ill\n\n   Bene. And how doe you?\n  Beat. Verie ill too.\nEnter Vrsula.\n\n  Bene. Serue God, loue me, and mend, there will I leaue\nyou too, for here comes one in haste\n\n   Vrs.

Will you go heare this newes Signior?\n  Bene. I will liue in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be buried\nin thy eies: and moreouer, I will goe with thee to\nthy Vncles.\n\nExeunt.\n\nEnter Claudio, Prince, and three or foure with Tapers.\n\n  Clau. Is this the monument of Leonato?\n  Lord. It is my Lord.\n\nEpitaph.\n\nDone to death by slanderous tongues,\nWas the Hero that here lies:\nDeath in guerdon of her wrongs,\nGiues her fame which neuer dies:\nSo the life that dyed with shame,\nLiues in death with glorious fame.\nHang thou there vpon the tombe,\nPraising her when I am dombe\n\n   Clau. Now musick sound & sing your solemn hymne\n\nSong.\n\nPardon goddesse of the night,\nThose that slew thy virgin knight,\nFor the which with songs of woe,\nRound about her tombe they goe:\nMidnight assist our mone, helpe vs to sigh and grone.\nHeauily, heauily.\nGraues yawne and yeelde your dead,\nTill death be vttered,\nHeauenly, heauenly\n\n   Lo. Now vnto thy bones good night, yeerely will I do this right\n\n   Prin. Good morrow masters, put your Torches out,\nThe wolues haue preied, and looke, the gentle day\nBefore the wheeles of Phoebus, round about\nDapples the drowsie East with spots of grey:\nThanks to you all, and leaue vs, fare you well\n\n   Clau. Good morrow masters, each his seuerall way\n\n   Prin. Come let vs hence, and put on other weedes,\nAnd then to Leonatoes we will goe\n\n   Clau. And Hymen now with luckier issue speeds,\nThen this for whom we rendred vp this woe.\n\nExeunt.\n\nEnter Leonato, Bene. Marg. Vrsula, old man, Frier, Hero.\n\n  Frier. Did I not tell you she was innocent?\n  Leo. So are the Prince and Claudio who accus'd her,\nVpon the errour that you heard debated:\nBut Margaret was in some fault for this,\nAlthough against her will as it appeares,\nIn the true course of all the question\n\n   Old. Well, I am glad that all things sort so well\n\n   Bene. And so am I, being else by faith enforc'd\nTo call young Claudio to a reckoning for it\n\n   Leo. Well daughter, and you gentlewomen all,\nWithdraw into a chamber by your selues,\nAnd when I send for you, come hither mask'd:\nThe Prince and Claudio promis'd by this howre\nTo visit me, you know your office Brother,\nYou must be father to your brothers daughter,\nAnd giue her to young Claudio.\n\nExeunt. Ladies.\n\n  Old. Which I will doe with confirm'd countenance\n\n   Bene. Frier, I must intreat your paines, I thinke\n\n   Frier. To doe what Signior?\n  Bene. To binde me, or vndoe me, one of them:\nSignior Leonato, truth it is good Signior,\nYour neece regards me with an eye of fauour\n\n   Leo. That eye my daughter lent her, 'tis most true\n\n   Bene. And I doe with an eye of loue requite her\n\n   Leo. The sight whereof I thinke you had from me,\nFrom Claudio, and the Prince, but what's your will?\n  Bened. Your answer sir is Enigmaticall,\nBut for my will, my will is, your good will\nMay stand with ours, this day to be conioyn'd,\nIn the state of honourable marriage,\nIn which (good Frier) I shall desire your helpe\n\n   Leon.

Good morrow Benedicke, why what's the matter?\nThat you haue such a Februarie face,\nSo full of frost, of storme, and clowdinesse\n\n   Claud. I thinke he thinkes vpon the sauage bull:\nTush, feare not man, wee'll tip thy hornes with gold,\nAnd all Europa shall reioyce at thee,\nAs once Europa did at lusty Ioue,\nWhen he would play the noble beast in loue\n\n   Ben. Bull Ioue sir, had an amiable low,\nAnd some such strange bull leapt your fathers Cow,\nA got a Calfe in that same noble feat,\nMuch like to you, for you haue iust his bleat.\nEnter brother, Hero, Beatrice, Margaret, Vrsula.\n\n  Cla. For this I owe you: here comes other recknings.\nWhich is the Lady I must seize vpon?\n  Leo. This same is she, and I doe giue you her\n\n   Cla. Why then she's mine, sweet let me see your face\n\n   Leon. No that you shal not, till you take her hand,\nBefore this Frier, and sweare to marry her\n\n   Clau.

All this amazement can I qualifie,\nWhen after that the holy rites are ended,\nIle tell you largely of faire Heroes death:\nMeane time let wonder seeme familiar,\nAnd to the chappell let vs presently\n\n   Ben. Soft and faire Frier, which is Beatrice?\n  Beat. I answer to that name, what is your will?\n  Bene. Doe not you loue me?\n  Beat. Why no, no more then reason\n\n   Bene. Why then your Vncle, and the Prince, & Claudio,\nhaue beene deceiued, they swore you did\n\n   Beat. Doe not you loue mee?\n  Bene. Troth no, no more then reason\n\n   Beat.

Old John of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster,\n    Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,\n    Brought hither Henry Hereford, thy bold son,\n    Here to make good the boist'rous late appeal,\n    Which then our leisure would not let us hear,\n    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?\n  GAUNT. I have, my liege.\n  KING RICHARD. Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him\n    If he appeal the Duke on ancient malice,\n    Or worthily, as a good subject should,\n    On some known ground of treachery in him?\n  GAUNT. As near as I could sift him on that argument,\n    On some apparent danger seen in him\n    Aim'd at your Highness-no inveterate malice.\n  KING RICHARD. Then call them to our presence: face to face\n    And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear \n    The accuser and the accused freely speak.\n    High-stomach'd are they both and full of ire,\n    In rage, deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.\n\n         Enter BOLINGBROKE and MOWBRAY\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. Many years of happy days befall\n    My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!\n  MOWBRAY. Each day still better other's happiness\n    Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,\n    Add an immortal title to your crown!\n  KING RICHARD. We thank you both; yet one but flatters us,\n    As well appeareth by the cause you come;\n    Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.\n    Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object\n    Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?\n  BOLINGBROKE. First-heaven be the record to my speech!\n    In the devotion of a subject's love,\n    Tend'ring the precious safety of my prince,\n    And free from other misbegotten hate, \n    Come I appellant to this princely presence.\n    Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,\n    And mark my greeting well; for what I speak\n    My body shall make good upon this earth,\n    Or my divine soul answer it in heaven-\n    Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,\n    Too good to be so, and too bad to live,\n    Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,\n    The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.\n    Once more, the more to aggravate the note,\n    With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;\n    And wish-so please my sovereign-ere I move,\n    What my tongue speaks, my right drawn sword may prove.\n  MOWBRAY. Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal.\n    'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,\n    The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,\n    Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;\n    The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this.\n    Yet can I not of such tame patience boast\n    As to be hush'd and nought at an to say. \n    First, the fair reverence of your Highness curbs me\n    From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;\n    Which else would post until it had return'd\n    These terms of treason doubled down his throat.\n    Setting aside his high blood's royalty,\n    And let him be no kinsman to my liege,\n    I do defy him, and I spit at him,\n    Call him a slanderous coward and a villain;\n    Which to maintain, I would allow him odds\n    And meet him, were I tied to run afoot\n    Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,\n    Or any other ground inhabitable\n    Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.\n    Meantime let this defend my loyalty-\n    By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie\n  BOLINGBROKE. Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,\n    Disclaiming here the kindred of the King;\n    And lay aside my high blood's royalty,\n    Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.\n    If guilty dread have left thee so much strength \n    As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop.\n    By that and all the rites of knighthood else\n    Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,\n    What I have spoke or thou canst worst devise.\n  MOWBRAY. I take it up; and by that sword I swear\n    Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder\n    I'll answer thee in any fair degree\n    Or chivalrous design of knightly trial;\n    And when I mount, alive may I not light\n    If I be traitor or unjustly fight!\n  KING RICHARD. What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?\n    It must be great that can inherit us\n    So much as of a thought of ill in him.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Look what I speak, my life shall prove it true-\n    That Mowbray hath receiv'd eight thousand nobles\n    In name of lendings for your Highness' soldiers,\n    The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments\n    Like a false traitor and injurious villain.\n    Besides, I say and will in battle prove-\n    Or here, or elsewhere to the furthest verge \n    That ever was survey'd by English eye-\n    That all the treasons for these eighteen years\n    Complotted and contrived in this land\n    Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.\n    Further I say, and further will maintain\n    Upon his bad life to make all this good,\n    That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,\n    Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,\n    And consequently, like a traitor coward,\n    Sluic'd out his innocent soul through streams of blood;\n    Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,\n    Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,\n    To me for justice and rough chastisement;\n    And, by the glorious worth of my descent,\n    This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.\n  KING RICHARD. How high a pitch his resolution soars!\n    Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?\n  MOWBRAY. O, let my sovereign turn away his face\n    And bid his ears a little while be deaf,\n    Till I have told this slander of his blood \n    How God and good men hate so foul a liar.\n  KING RICHARD. Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and cars.\n    Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,\n    As he is but my father's brother's son,\n    Now by my sceptre's awe I make a vow,\n    Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood\n    Should nothing privilege him nor partialize\n    The unstooping firmness of my upright soul.\n    He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:\n    Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.\n  MOWBRAY. Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,\n    Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.\n    Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais\n    Disburs'd I duly to his Highness' soldiers;\n    The other part reserv'd I by consent,\n    For that my sovereign liege was in my debt\n    Upon remainder of a dear account\n    Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:\n    Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death-\n    I slew him not, but to my own disgrace \n    Neglected my sworn duty in that case.\n    For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,\n    The honourable father to my foe,\n    Once did I lay an ambush for your life,\n    A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul;\n    But ere I last receiv'd the sacrament\n    I did confess it, and exactly begg'd\n    Your Grace's pardon; and I hope I had it.\n    This is my fault. As for the rest appeal'd,\n    It issues from the rancour of a villain,\n    A recreant and most degenerate traitor;\n    Which in myself I boldly will defend,\n    And interchangeably hurl down my gage\n    Upon this overweening traitor's foot\n    To prove myself a loyal gentleman\n    Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.\n    In haste whereof, most heartily I pray\n    Your Highness to assign our trial day.\n  KING RICHARD. Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be rul'd by me;\n    Let's purge this choler without letting blood- \n    This we prescribe, though no physician;\n    Deep malice makes too deep incision.\n    Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed:\n    Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.\n    Good uncle, let this end where it begun;\n    We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.\n  GAUNT. To be a make-peace shall become my age.\n    Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.\n  KING RICHARD. And, Norfolk, throw down his.\n  GAUNT. When, Harry, when?\n    Obedience bids I should not bid again.\n  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, throw down; we bid.\n    There is no boot.\n  MOWBRAY. Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot;\n    My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:\n    The one my duty owes; but my fair name,\n    Despite of death, that lives upon my grave\n    To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.\n    I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffl'd here;\n    Pierc'd to the soul with slander's venom'd spear, \n    The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood\n    Which breath'd this poison.\n  KING RICHARD. Rage must be withstood:\n    Give me his gage-lions make leopards tame.\n  MOWBRAY. Yea, but not change his spots. Take but my shame,\n    And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,\n    The purest treasure mortal times afford\n    Is spotless reputation; that away,\n    Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.\n    A jewel in a ten-times barr'd-up chest\n    Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.\n    Mine honour is my life; both grow in one;\n    Take honour from me, and my life is done:\n    Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;\n    In that I live, and for that will I die.\n  KING RICHARD. Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.\n  BOLINGBROKE. O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!\n    Shall I seem crest-fallen in my father's sight?\n    Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height\n    Before this outdar'd dastard? Ere my tongue \n    Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong\n    Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear\n    The slavish motive of recanting fear,\n    And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,\n    Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.\n                                                      Exit GAUNT\n  KING RICHARD. We were not born to sue, but to command;\n    Which since we cannot do to make you friends,\n    Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,\n    At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day.\n    There shall your swords and lances arbitrate\n    The swelling difference of your settled hate;\n    Since we can not atone you, we shall see\n    Justice design the victor's chivalry.\n    Lord Marshal, command our officers-at-arms\n    Be ready to direct these home alarms.                 Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\nLondon. The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace\n\nEnter JOHN OF GAUNT with the DUCHESS OF GLOUCESTER\n\n  GAUNT. Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood\n    Doth more solicit me than your exclaims\n    To stir against the butchers of his life!\n    But since correction lieth in those hands\n    Which made the fault that we cannot correct,\n    Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;\n    Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,\n    Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.\n  DUCHESS. Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?\n    Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?\n    Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,\n    Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,\n    Or seven fair branches springing from one root.\n    Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,\n    Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;\n    But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,\n    One vial full of Edward's sacred blood, \n    One flourishing branch of his most royal root,\n    Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt;\n    Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,\n    By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.\n    Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! That bed, that womb,\n    That mettle, that self mould, that fashion'd thee,\n    Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,\n    Yet art thou slain in him. Thou dost consent\n    In some large measure to thy father's death\n    In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,\n    Who was the model of thy father's life.\n    Call it not patience, Gaunt-it is despair;\n    In suff'ring thus thy brother to be slaught'red,\n    Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,\n    Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee.\n    That which in mean men we entitle patience\n    Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.\n    What shall I say? To safeguard thine own life\n    The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.\n  GAUNT. God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute, \n    His deputy anointed in His sight,\n    Hath caus'd his death; the which if wrongfully,\n    Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift\n    An angry arm against His minister.\n  DUCHESS. Where then, alas, may I complain myself?\n  GAUNT. To God, the widow's champion and defence.\n  DUCHESS. Why then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.\n    Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold\n    Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight.\n    O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,\n    That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!\n    Or, if misfortune miss the first career,\n    Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom\n    That they may break his foaming courser's back\n    And throw the rider headlong in the lists,\n    A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!\n    Farewell, old Gaunt; thy sometimes brother's wife,\n    With her companion, Grief, must end her life.\n  GAUNT. Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry.\n    As much good stay with thee as go with me! \n  DUCHESS. Yet one word more- grief boundeth where it falls,\n    Not with the empty hollowness, but weight.\n    I take my leave before I have begun,\n    For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.\n    Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.\n    Lo, this is all- nay, yet depart not so;\n    Though this be all, do not so quickly go;\n    I shall remember more. Bid him- ah, what?-\n    With all good speed at Plashy visit me.\n    Alack, and what shall good old York there see\n    But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,\n    Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?\n    And what hear there for welcome but my groans?\n    Therefore commend me; let him not come there\n    To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.\n    Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die;\n    The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\nThe lists at Coventry\n\nEnter the LORD MARSHAL and the DUKE OF AUMERLE\n\n  MARSHAL. My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?\n  AUMERLE. Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.\n  MARSHAL. The Duke of Norfolk, spightfully and bold,\n    Stays but the summons of the appelant's trumpet.\n  AUMERLE. Why then, the champions are prepar'd, and stay\n    For nothing but his Majesty's approach.\n\n     The trumpets sound, and the KING enters with his nobles,\n     GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and others. When they are set,\n     enter MOWBRAY, Duke of Nor folk, in arms, defendant, and\n     a HERALD\n\n  KING RICHARD. Marshal, demand of yonder champion\n    The cause of his arrival here in arms;\n    Ask him his name; and orderly proceed\n    To swear him in the justice of his cause.\n  MARSHAL. In God's name and the King's, say who thou art, \n    And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms;\n    Against what man thou com'st, and what thy quarrel.\n    Speak truly on thy knighthood and thy oath;\n    As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!\n  MOWBRAY. My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;\n    Who hither come engaged by my oath-\n    Which God defend a knight should violate!-\n    Both to defend my loyalty and truth\n    To God, my King, and my succeeding issue,\n    Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me;\n    And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,\n    To prove him, in defending of myself,\n    A traitor to my God, my King, and me.\n    And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!\n\n   The trumpets sound. Enter BOLINGBROKE, Duke of Hereford,\n            appellant, in armour, and a HERALD\n\n  KING RICHARD. Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,\n    Both who he is and why he cometh hither \n    Thus plated in habiliments of war;\n    And formally, according to our law,\n    Depose him in the justice of his cause.\n  MARSHAL. What is thy name? and wherefore com'st thou hither\n    Before King Richard in his royal lists?\n    Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?\n    Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!\n  BOLINGBROKE. Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,\n    Am I; who ready here do stand in arms\n    To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,\n    In lists on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,\n    That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,\n    To God of heaven, King Richard, and to me.\n    And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!\n  MARSHAL. On pain of death, no person be so bold\n    Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,\n    Except the Marshal and such officers\n    Appointed to direct these fair designs.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Lord Marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,\n    And bow my knee before his Majesty; \n    For Mowbray and myself are like two men\n    That vow a long and weary pilgrimage.\n    Then let us take a ceremonious leave\n    And loving farewell of our several friends.\n  MARSHAL. The appellant in all duty greets your Highness,\n    And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.\n  KING RICHARD. We will descend and fold him in our arms.\n    Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,\n    So be thy fortune in this royal fight!\n    Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,\n    Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.\n  BOLINGBROKE. O, let no noble eye profane a tear\n    For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbray's spear.\n    As confident as is the falcon's flight\n    Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.\n    My loving lord, I take my leave of you;\n    Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;\n    Not sick, although I have to do with death,\n    But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.\n    Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet \n    The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet.\n    O thou, the earthly author of my blood,\n    Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,\n    Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up\n    To reach at victory above my head,\n    Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers,\n    And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,\n    That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat\n    And furbish new the name of John o' Gaunt,\n    Even in the lusty haviour of his son.\n  GAUNT. God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!\n    Be swift like lightning in the execution,\n    And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,\n    Fall like amazing thunder on the casque\n    Of thy adverse pernicious enemy.\n    Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant, and live.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Mine innocence and Saint George to thrive!\n  MOWBRAY. However God or fortune cast my lot,\n    There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,\n    A loyal, just, and upright gentleman. \n    Never did captive with a freer heart\n    Cast off his chains of bondage, and embrace\n    His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,\n    More than my dancing soul doth celebrate\n    This feast of battle with mine adversary.\n    Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,\n    Take from my mouth the wish of happy years.\n    As gentle and as jocund as to jest\n    Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.\n  KING RICHARD. Farewell, my lord, securely I espy\n    Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.\n    Order the trial, Marshal, and begin.\n  MARSHAL. Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,\n    Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!\n  BOLINGBROKE. Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.\n  MARSHAL. [To an officer] Go bear this lance to Thomas,\n      Duke of Norfolk.\n  FIRST HERALD. Harry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,\n    Stands here for God, his sovereign, and himself,\n    On pain to be found false and recreant, \n    To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,\n    A traitor to his God, his King, and him;\n    And dares him to set forward to the fight.\n  SECOND HERALD. Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,\n    On pain to be found false and recreant,\n    Both to defend himself, and to approve\n    Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,\n    To God, his sovereign, and to him disloyal,\n    Courageously and with a free desire\n    Attending but the signal to begin.\n  MARSHAL. Sound trumpets; and set forward, combatants.\n                                           [A charge sounded]\n    Stay, the King hath thrown his warder down.\n  KING RICHARD. Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,\n    And both return back to their chairs again.\n    Withdraw with us; and let the trumpets sound\n    While we return these dukes what we decree.\n\n    A long flourish, while the KING consults his Council\n \n    Draw near,\n    And list what with our council we have done.\n    For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd\n    With that dear blood which it hath fostered;\n    And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect\n    Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;\n    And for we think the eagle-winged pride\n    Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,\n    With rival-hating envy, set on you\n    To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle\n    Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;\n    Which so rous'd up with boist'rous untun'd drums,\n    With harsh-resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,\n    And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,\n    Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace\n    And make us wade even in our kindred's blood-\n    Therefore we banish you our territories.\n    You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,\n    Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields\n    Shall not regreet our fair dominions, \n    But tread the stranger paths of banishment.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Your will be done. This must my comfort be-\n    That sun that warms you here shall shine on me,\n    And those his golden beams to you here lent\n    Shall point on me and gild my banishment.\n  KING RICHARD. Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,\n    Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:\n    The sly slow hours shall not determinate\n    The dateless limit of thy dear exile;\n    The hopeless word of 'never to return'\n    Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.\n  MOWBRAY. A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,\n    And all unlook'd for from your Highness' mouth.\n    A dearer merit, not so deep a maim\n    As to be cast forth in the common air,\n    Have I deserved at your Highness' hands.\n    The language I have learnt these forty years,\n    My native English, now I must forgo;\n    And now my tongue's use is to me no more\n    Than an unstringed viol or a harp; \n    Or like a cunning instrument cas'd up\n    Or, being open, put into his hands\n    That knows no touch to tune the harmony.\n    Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,\n    Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;\n    And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance\n    Is made my gaoler to attend on me.\n    I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,\n    Too far in years to be a pupil now.\n    What is thy sentence, then, but speechless death,\n    Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?\n  KING RICHARD. It boots thee not to be compassionate;\n    After our sentence plaining comes too late.\n  MOWBRAY. Then thus I turn me from my countrv's light,\n    To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.\n  KING RICHARD. Return again, and take an oath with thee.\n    Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;\n    Swear by the duty that you owe to God,\n    Our part therein we banish with yourselves,\n    To keep the oath that we administer: \n    You never shall, so help you truth and God,\n    Embrace each other's love in banishment;\n    Nor never look upon each other's face;\n    Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile\n    This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;\n    Nor never by advised purpose meet\n    To plot, contrive, or complot any ill,\n    'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.\n  BOLINGBROKE. I swear.\n  MOWBRAY. And I, to keep all this.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy.\n    By this time, had the King permitted us,\n    One of our souls had wand'red in the air,\n    Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,\n    As now our flesh is banish'd from this land-\n    Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;\n    Since thou hast far to go, bear not along\n    The clogging burden of a guilty soul.\n  MOWBRAY. No, Bolingbroke; if ever I were traitor,\n    My name be blotted from the book of life, \n    And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!\n    But what thou art, God, thou, and I, do know;\n    And all too soon, I fear, the King shall rue.\n    Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray:\n    Save back to England, an the world's my way.            Exit\n  KING RICHARD. Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes\n    I see thy grieved heart. Thy sad aspect\n    Hath from the number of his banish'd years\n    Pluck'd four away. [To BOLINGBROKE] Six frozen winters spent,\n    Return with welcome home from banishment.\n  BOLINGBROKE. How long a time lies in one little word!\n    Four lagging winters and four wanton springs\n    End in a word: such is the breath of Kings.\n  GAUNT. I thank my liege that in regard of me\n    He shortens four years of my son's exile;\n    But little vantage shall I reap thereby,\n    For ere the six years that he hath to spend\n    Can change their moons and bring their times about,\n    My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light\n    Shall be extinct with age and endless night; \n    My inch of taper will be burnt and done,\n    And blindfold death not let me see my son.\n  KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, thou hast many years to live.\n  GAUNT. But not a minute, King, that thou canst give:\n    Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow\n    And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;\n    Thou can'st help time to furrow me with age,\n    But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;\n    Thy word is current with him for my death,\n    But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.\n  KING RICHARD. Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,\n    Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave.\n    Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?\n  GAUNT. Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.\n    You urg'd me as a judge; but I had rather\n    You would have bid me argue like a father.\n    O, had it been a stranger, not my child,\n    To smooth his fault I should have been more mild.\n    A partial slander sought I to avoid,\n    And in the sentence my own life destroy'd. \n    Alas, I look'd when some of you should say\n    I was too strict to make mine own away;\n    But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue\n    Against my will to do myself this wrong.\n  KING RICHARD. Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so.\n    Six years we banish him, and he shall go.\n                                  Flourish. Exit KING with train\n  AUMERLE. Cousin, farewell; what presence must not know,\n    From where you do remain let paper show.\n  MARSHAL. My lord, no leave take I, for I will ride\n    As far as land will let me by your side.\n  GAUNT. O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,\n    That thou returnest no greeting to thy friends?\n  BOLINGBROKE. I have too few to take my leave of you,\n    When the tongue's office should be prodigal\n    To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.\n  GAUNT. Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Joy absent, grief is present for that time.\n  GAUNT. What is six winters? They are quickly gone.\n  BOLINGBROKE. To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten. \n  GAUNT. Call it a travel that thou tak'st for pleasure.\n  BOLINGBROKE. My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,\n    Which finds it an enforced pilgrimage.\n  GAUNT. The sullen passage of thy weary steps\n    Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set\n    The precious jewel of thy home return.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make\n    Will but remember me what a deal of world\n    I wander from the jewels that I love.\n    Must I not serve a long apprenticehood\n    To foreign passages; and in the end,\n    Having my freedom, boast of nothing else\n    But that I was a journeyman to grief?\n  GAUNT. All places that the eye of heaven visits\n    Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.\n    Teach thy necessity to reason thus:\n    There is no virtue like necessity.\n    Think not the King did banish thee,\n    But thou the King. Woe doth the heavier sit\n    Where it perceives it is but faintly home. \n    Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour,\n    And not the King exil'd thee; or suppose\n    Devouring pestilence hangs in our air\n    And thou art flying to a fresher clime.\n    Look what thy soul holds dear, imagine it\n    To lie that way thou goest, not whence thou com'st.\n    Suppose the singing birds musicians,\n    The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,\n    The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more\n    Than a delightful measure or a dance;\n    For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite\n    The man that mocks at it and sets it light.\n  BOLINGBROKE. O, who can hold a fire in his hand\n    By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?\n    Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite\n    By bare imagination of a feast?\n    Or wallow naked in December snow\n    By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?\n    O, no! the apprehension of the good\n    Gives but the greater feeling to the worse. \n    Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more\n    Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.\n  GAUNT. Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way.\n    Had I thy youtli and cause, I would not stay.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil,\nadieu;\n    My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!\n    Where'er I wander, boast of this I can:\n    Though banish'd, yet a trueborn English man.          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4.\nLondon. The court\n\nEnter the KING, with BAGOT and GREEN, at one door;\nand the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another\n\n  KING RICHARD. We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,\n    How far brought you high Hereford on his way?\n  AUMERLE. I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,\n    But to the next high way, and there I left him.\n  KING RICHARD. And say, what store of parting tears were shed?\n  AUMERLE. Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,\n    Which then blew bitterly against our faces,\n    Awak'd the sleeping rheum, and so by chance\n    Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.\n  KING RICHARD. What said our cousin when you parted with him?\n  AUMERLE. 'Farewell.'\n    And, for my heart disdained that my tongue\n    Should so profane the word, that taught me craft\n    To counterfeit oppression of such grief\n    That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.\n    Marry, would the word 'farewell' have length'ned hours \n    And added years to his short banishment,\n    He should have had a volume of farewells;\n    But since it would not, he had none of me.\n  KING RICHARD. He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,\n    When time shall call him home from banishment,\n    Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.\n    Ourself, and Bushy, Bagot here, and Green,\n    Observ'd his courtship to the common people;\n    How he did seem to dive into their hearts\n    With humble and familiar courtesy;\n    What reverence he did throw away on slaves,\n    Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles\n    And patient underbearing of his fortune,\n    As 'twere to banish their affects with him.\n    Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;\n    A brace of draymen bid God speed him well\n    And had the tribute of his supple knee,\n    With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends';\n    As were our England in reversion his,\n    And he our subjects' next degree in hope. \n  GREEN. Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts!\n    Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,\n    Expedient manage must be made, my liege,\n    Ere further leisure yicld them further means\n    For their advantage and your Highness' loss.\n  KING RICHARD. We will ourself in person to this war;\n    And, for our coffers, with too great a court\n    And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,\n    We are enforc'd to farm our royal realm;\n    The revenue whereof shall furnish us\n    For our affairs in hand. If that come short,\n    Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;\n    Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,\n    They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold,\n    And send them after to supply our wants;\n    For we will make for Ireland presently.\n\n                     Enter BUSHY\n\n    Bushy, what news? \n  BUSHY. Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,\n    Suddenly taken; and hath sent poste-haste\n    To entreat your Majesty to visit him.\n  KING RICHARD. Where lies he?\n  BUSHY. At Ely House.\n  KING RICHARD. Now put it, God, in the physician's mind\n    To help him to his grave immediately!\n    The lining of his coffers shall make coats\n    To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.\n    Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him.\n    Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!\n  ALL. Amen.

Ely House\n\nEnter JOHN OF GAUNT, sick, with the DUKE OF YORK, etc.\n\n  GAUNT. Will the King come, that I may breathe my last\n    In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?\n  YORK. Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;\n    For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.\n  GAUNT. O, but they say the tongues of dying men\n    Enforce attention like deep harmony.\n    Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain;\n    For they breathe truth that breathe their words -in pain.\n    He that no more must say is listen'd more\n    Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;\n    More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before.\n    The setting sun, and music at the close,\n    As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,\n    Writ in remembrance more than things long past.\n    Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,\n    My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.\n  YORK. No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds, \n    As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,\n    Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound\n    The open ear of youth doth always listen;\n    Report of fashions in proud Italy,\n    Whose manners still our tardy apish nation\n    Limps after in base imitation.\n    Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity-\n    So it be new, there's no respect how vile-\n    That is not quickly buzz'd into his ears?\n    Then all too late comes counsel to be heard\n    Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.\n    Direct not him whose way himself will choose.\n    'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.\n  GAUNT. Methinks I am a prophet new inspir'd,\n    And thus expiring do foretell of him:\n    His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,\n    For violent fires soon burn out themselves;\n    Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;\n    He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;\n    With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder; \n    Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,\n    Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.\n    This royal throne of kings, this scept'red isle,\n    This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,\n    This other Eden, demi-paradise,\n    This fortress built by Nature for herself\n    Against infection and the hand of war,\n    This happy breed of men, this little world,\n    This precious stone set in the silver sea,\n    Which serves it in the office of a wall,\n    Or as a moat defensive to a house,\n    Against the envy of less happier lands;\n    This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,\n    This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,\n    Fear'd by their breed, and famous by their birth,\n    Renowned for their deeds as far from home,\n    For Christian service and true chivalry,\n    As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry\n    Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son;\n    This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land, \n    Dear for her reputation through the world,\n    Is now leas'd out-I die pronouncing it-\n    Like to a tenement or pelting farm.\n    England, bound in with the triumphant sea,\n    Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege\n    Of wat'ry Neptune, is now bound in with shame,\n    With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds;\n    That England, that was wont to conquer others,\n    Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.\n    Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,\n    How happy then were my ensuing death!\n\n    Enter KING and QUEEN, AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, BAGOT,\n                Ross, and WILLOUGHBY\n\n  YORK. The King is come; deal mildly with his youth,\n    For young hot colts being rag'd do rage the more.\n  QUEEN. How fares our noble uncle Lancaster?\n  KING RICHARD. What comfort, man? How is't with aged Gaunt?\n  GAUNT. O, how that name befits my composition! \n    Old Gaunt, indeed; and gaunt in being old.\n    Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;\n    And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?\n    For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;\n    Watching breeds leanness, leanness is an gaunt.\n    The pleasure that some fathers feed upon\n    Is my strict fast-I mean my children's looks;\n    And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt.\n    Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,\n    Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.\n  KING RICHARD. Can sick men play so nicely with their names?\n  GAUNT. No, misery makes sport to mock itself:\n    Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,\n    I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.\n  KING RICHARD. Should dying men flatter with those that live?\n  GAUNT. No, no; men living flatter those that die.\n  KING RICHARD. Thou, now a-dying, sayest thou flatterest me.\n  GAUNT. O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.\n  KING RICHARD. I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.\n  GAUNT. Now He that made me knows I see thee ill; \n    Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.\n    Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land\n    Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;\n    And thou, too careless patient as thou art,\n    Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure\n    Of those physicians that first wounded thee:\n    A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,\n    Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;\n    And yet, incaged in so small a verge,\n    The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.\n    O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye\n    Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,\n    From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,\n    Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,\n    Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.\n    Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,\n    It were a shame to let this land by lease;\n    But for thy world enjoying but this land,\n    Is it not more than shame to shame it so?\n    Landlord of England art thou now, not King. \n    Thy state of law is bondslave to the law;\n    And thou-\n  KING RICHARD. A lunatic lean-witted fool,\n    Presuming on an ague's privilege,\n    Darest with thy frozen admonition\n    Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood\n    With fury from his native residence.\n    Now by my seat's right royal majesty,\n    Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,\n    This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head\n    Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.\n  GAUNT. O, Spare me not, my brother Edward's son,\n    For that I was his father Edward's son;\n    That blood already, like the pelican,\n    Hast thou tapp'd out, and drunkenly carous'd.\n    My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul-\n    Whom fair befall in heaven 'mongst happy souls!-\n    May be a precedent and witness good\n    That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood.\n    Join with the present sickness that I have; \n    And thy unkindness be like crooked age,\n    To crop at once a too long withered flower.\n    Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!\n    These words hereafter thy tormentors be!\n    Convey me to my bed, then to my grave.\n    Love they to live that love and honour have.\n                               Exit, borne out by his attendants\n  KING RICHARD. And let them die that age and sullens have;\n    For both hast thou, and both become the grave.\n  YORK. I do beseech your Majesty impute his words\n    To wayward sickliness and age in him.\n    He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear\n    As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.\n  KING RICHARD. Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;\n    As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.\n\n                Enter NORTHUMBERLAND\n\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your\nMajesty.\n  KING RICHARD. What says he? \n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, nothing; all is said.\n    His tongue is now a stringless instrument;\n    Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent.\n  YORK. Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!\n    Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.\n  KING RICHARD. The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;\n    His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.\n    So much for that. Now for our Irish wars.\n    We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,\n    Which live like venom where no venom else\n    But only they have privilege to live.\n    And for these great affairs do ask some charge,\n    Towards our assistance we do seize to us\n    The plate, coin, revenues, and moveables,\n    Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.\n  YORK. How long shall I be patient? Ah, how long\n    Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?\n    Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment,\n    Nor Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,\n    Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke \n    About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,\n    Have ever made me sour my patient cheek\n    Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.\n    I am the last of noble Edward's sons,\n    Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first.\n    In war was never lion rag'd more fierce,\n    In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,\n    Than was that young and princely gentleman.\n    His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,\n    Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;\n    But when he frown'd, it was against the French\n    And not against his friends. His noble hand\n    Did win what he did spend, and spent not that\n    Which his triumphant father's hand had won.\n    His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,\n    But bloody with the enemies of his kin.\n    O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,\n    Or else he never would compare between-\n  KING RICHARD. Why, uncle, what's the matter?\n  YORK. O my liege, \n    Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleas'd\n    Not to be pardoned, am content withal.\n    Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands\n    The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?\n    Is not Gaunt dead? and doth not Hereford live?\n    Was not Gaunt just? and is not Harry true?\n    Did not the one deserve to have an heir?\n    Is not his heir a well-deserving son?\n    Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time\n    His charters and his customary rights;\n    Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;\n    Be not thyself-for how art thou a king\n    But by fair sequence and succession?\n    Now, afore God-God forbid I say true!-\n    If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,\n    Call in the letters patents that he hath\n    By his attorneys-general to sue\n    His livery, and deny his off'red homage,\n    You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,\n    You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts, \n    And prick my tender patience to those thoughts\n    Which honour and allegiance cannot think.\n  KING RICHARD. Think what you will, we seize into our hands\n    His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands.\n  YORK. I'll not be by the while. My liege, farewell.\n    What will ensue hereof there's none can tell;\n    But by bad courses may be understood\n    That their events can never fall out good.              Exit\n  KING RICHARD. Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight;\n    Bid him repair to us to Ely House\n    To see this business. To-morrow next\n    We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow.\n    And we create, in absence of ourself,\n    Our Uncle York Lord Governor of England;\n    For he is just, and always lov'd us well.\n    Come on, our queen; to-morrow must we part;\n    Be merry, for our time of stay is short.\n                   Flourish. Exeunt KING, QUEEN, BUSHY, AUMERLE,\n                                                GREEN, and BAGOT\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead. \n    Ross. And living too; for now his son is Duke.\n  WILLOUGHBY. Barely in title, not in revenues.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Richly in both, if justice had her right.\n  ROSS. My heart is great; but it must break with silence,\n    Ere't be disburdened with a liberal tongue.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak\nmore\n    That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!\n  WILLOUGHBY. Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of\nHereford?\n    If it be so, out with it boldly, man;\n    Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.\n  ROSS. No good at all that I can do for him;\n    Unless you call it good to pity him,\n    Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are\nborne\n    In him, a royal prince, and many moe\n    Of noble blood in this declining land.\n    The King is not himself, but basely led\n    By flatterers; and what they will inform,\n    Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us an,\n    That will the King severely prosecute \n    'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.\n  ROSS. The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes;\n    And quite lost their hearts; the nobles hath he find\n    For ancient quarrels and quite lost their hearts.\n  WILLOUGHBY. And daily new exactions are devis'd,\n    As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what;\n    But what, a God's name, doth become of this?\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Wars hath not wasted it, for warr'd he hath\nnot,\n    But basely yielded upon compromise\n    That which his noble ancestors achiev'd with blows.\n    More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.\n  ROSS. The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.\n  WILLOUGHBY. The King's grown bankrupt like a broken man.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.\n  ROSS. He hath not money for these Irish wars,\n    His burdenous taxations notwithstanding,\n    But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. His noble kinsman-most degenerate king!\n    But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,\n    Yet seek no shelter to avoid the storm; \n    We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,\n    And yet we strike not, but securely perish.\n  ROSS. We see the very wreck that we must suffer;\n    And unavoided is the danger now\n    For suffering so the causes of our wreck.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death\n    I spy life peering; but I dare not say\n    How near the tidings of our comfort is.\n  WILLOUGHBY. Nay, let us share thy thoughts as thou dost ours.\n  ROSS. Be confident to speak, Northumberland.\n    We three are but thyself, and, speaking so,\n    Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore be bold.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Then thus: I have from Le Port Blanc, a bay\n    In Brittany, receiv'd intelligence\n    That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,\n    That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,\n    His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,\n    Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,\n    Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton, and Francis Quoint-\n    All these, well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine, \n    With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,\n    Are making hither with all due expedience,\n    And shortly mean to touch our northern shore.\n    Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay\n    The first departing of the King for Ireland.\n    If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,\n    Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,\n    Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,\n    Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt,\n    And make high majesty look like itself,\n    Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;\n    But if you faint, as fearing to do so,\n    Stay and be secret, and myself will go.\n  ROSS. To horse, to horse! Urge doubts to them that fear.\n  WILLOUGHBY. Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.\n                                                          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\nWindsor Castle\n\nEnter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT\n\n  BUSHY. Madam, your Majesty is too much sad.\n    You promis'd, when you parted with the King,\n    To lay aside life-harming heaviness\n    And entertain a cheerful disposition.\n  QUEEN. To please the King, I did; to please myself\n    I cannot do it; yet I know no cause\n    Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,\n    Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest\n    As my sweet Richard. Yet again methinks\n    Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,\n    Is coming towards me, and my inward soul\n    With nothing trembles. At some thing it grieves\n    More than with parting from my lord the King.\n  BUSHY. Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,\n    Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;\n    For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,\n    Divides one thing entire to many objects, \n    Like perspectives which, rightly gaz'd upon,\n    Show nothing but confusion-ey'd awry,\n    Distinguish form. So your sweet Majesty,\n    Looking awry upon your lord's departure,\n    Find shapes of grief more than himself to wail;\n    Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows\n    Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious Queen,\n    More than your lord's departure weep not-more is not seen;\n    Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,\n    Which for things true weeps things imaginary.\n  QUEEN. It may be so; but yet my inward soul\n    Persuades me it is otherwise. Howe'er it be,\n    I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad\n    As-though, on thinking, on no thought I think-\n    Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.\n  BUSHY. 'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.\n  QUEEN. 'Tis nothing less: conceit is still deriv'd\n    From some forefather grief; mine is not so,\n    For nothing hath begot my something grief,\n    Or something hath the nothing that I grieve; \n    'Tis in reversion that I do possess-\n    But what it is that is not yet known what,\n    I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.\n\n                   Enter GREEN\n\n  GREEN. God save your Majesty! and well met, gentlemen.\n    I hope the King is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.\n  QUEEN. Why hopest thou so? 'Tis better hope he is;\n    For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope.\n    Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?\n  GREEN. That he, our hope, might have retir'd his power\n    And driven into despair an enemy's hope\n    Who strongly hath set footing in this land.\n    The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,\n    And with uplifted arms is safe arriv'd\n    At Ravenspurgh.\n  QUEEN. Now God in heaven forbid!\n  GREEN. Ah, madam, 'tis too true; and that is worse,\n    The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy, \n    The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,\n    With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.\n  BUSHY. Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland\n    And all the rest revolted faction traitors?\n  GREEN. We have; whereupon the Earl of Worcester\n    Hath broken his staff, resign'd his stewardship,\n    And all the household servants fled with him\n    To Bolingbroke.\n  QUEEN. So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,\n    And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir.\n    Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy;\n    And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,\n    Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.\n  BUSHY. Despair not, madam.\n  QUEEN. Who shall hinder me?\n    I will despair, and be at enmity\n    With cozening hope-he is a flatterer,\n    A parasite, a keeper-back of death,\n    Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,\n    Which false hope lingers in extremity. \n\n                    Enter YORK\n\n  GREEN. Here comes the Duke of York.\n  QUEEN. With signs of war about his aged neck.\n    O, full of careful business are his looks!\n    Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.\n  YORK. Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts.\n    Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,\n    Where nothing lives but crosses, cares, and grief.\n    Your husband, he is gone to save far off,\n    Whilst others come to make him lose at home.\n    Here am I left to underprop his land,\n    Who, weak with age, cannot support myself.\n    Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;\n    Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.\n\n                   Enter a SERVINGMAN\n\n  SERVINGMAN. My lord, your son was gone before I came. \n  YORK. He was-why so go all which way it will!\n    The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold\n    And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.\n    Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;\n    Bid her send me presently a thousand pound.\n    Hold, take my ring.\n  SERVINGMAN. My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,\n    To-day, as I came by, I called there-\n    But I shall grieve you to report the rest.\n  YORK. What is't, knave?\n  SERVINGMAN. An hour before I came, the Duchess died.\n  YORK. God for his mercy! what a tide of woes\n    Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!\n    I know not what to do. I would to God,\n    So my untruth had not provok'd him to it,\n    The King had cut off my head with my brother's.\n    What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?\n    How shall we do for money for these wars?\n    Come, sister-cousin, I would say-pray, pardon me.\n    Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts, \n    And bring away the armour that is there.\n                                                 Exit SERVINGMAN\n    Gentlemen, will you go muster men?\n    If I know how or which way to order these affairs\n    Thus disorderly thrust into my hands,\n    Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen.\n    T'one is my sovereign, whom both my oath\n    And duty bids defend; t'other again\n    Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd,\n    Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.\n    Well, somewhat we must do.-Come, cousin,\n    I'll dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster up your men\n    And meet me presently at Berkeley.\n    I should to Plashy too,\n    But time will not permit. All is uneven,\n    And everything is left at six and seven.\n                                           Exeunt YORK and QUEEN\n  BUSHY. The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland.\n    But none returns. For us to levy power\n    Proportionable to the enemy \n    Is all unpossible.\n  GREEN. Besides, our nearness to the King in love\n    Is near the hate of those love not the King.\n  BAGOT. And that is the wavering commons; for their love\n    Lies in their purses; and whoso empties them,\n    By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.\n  BUSHY. Wherein the King stands generally condemn'd.\n  BAGOT. If judgment lie in them, then so do we,\n    Because we ever have been near the King.\n  GREEN. Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristow Castle.\n    The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.\n  BUSHY. Thither will I with you; for little office\n    Will the hateful commons perform for us,\n    Except Eke curs to tear us all to pieces.\n    Will you go along with us?\n  BAGOT. No; I will to Ireland to his Majesty.\n    Farewell. If heart's presages be not vain,\n    We three here part that ne'er shall meet again.\n  BUSHY. That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.\n  GREEN. Alas, poor Duke! the task he undertakes \n    Is numb'ring sands and drinking oceans dry.\n    Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.\n    Farewell at once-for once, for all, and ever.\n  BUSHY. Well, we may meet again.\n  BAGOT. I fear me, never.                                Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\nGloucestershire\n\nEnter BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, forces\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Believe me, noble lord,\n    I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire.\n    These high wild hills and rough uneven ways\n    Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome;\n    And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,\n    Making the hard way sweet and delectable.\n    But I bethink me what a weary way\n    From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found\n    In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,\n    Which, I protest, hath very much beguil'd\n    The tediousness and process of my travel.\n    But theirs is sweet'ned with the hope to have\n    The present benefit which I possess;\n    And hope to joy is little less in joy\n    Than hope enjoy'd. By this the weary lords\n    Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done \n    By sight of what I have, your noble company.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Of much less value is my company\n    Than your good words. But who comes here?\n\n                 Enter HARRY PERCY\n\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. It is my son, young Harry Percy,\n    Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.\n    Harry, how fares your uncle?\n  PERCY. I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of\nyou.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Why, is he not with the Queen?\n  PERCY. No, my good lord; he hath forsook the court,\n    Broken his staff of office, and dispers'd\n    The household of the King.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. What was his reason?\n    He was not so resolv'd when last we spake together.\n  PERCY. Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.\n    But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,\n    To offer service to the Duke of Hereford;\n    And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover \n    What power the Duke of York had levied there;\n    Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?\n  PERCY. No, my good lord; for that is not forgot\n    Which ne'er I did remember; to my knowledge,\n    I never in my life did look on him.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Then learn to know him now; this is the Duke.\n  PERCY. My gracious lord, I tender you my service,\n    Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young;\n    Which elder days shall ripen, and confirm\n    To more approved service and desert.\n  BOLINGBROKE. I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure\n    I count myself in nothing else so happy\n    As in a soul rememb'ring my good friends;\n    And as my fortune ripens with thy love,\n    It shall be still thy true love's recompense.\n    My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. How far is it to Berkeley? And what stir\n    Keeps good old York there with his men of war?\n  PERCY. There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees, \n    Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;\n    And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour-\n    None else of name and noble estimate.\n\n                  Enter Ross and WILLOUGHBY\n\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,\n    Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues\n    A banish'd traitor. All my treasury\n    Is yet but unfelt thanks, which, more enrich'd,\n    Shall be your love and labour's recompense.\n  ROSS. Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.\n  WILLOUGHBY. And far surmounts our labour to attain it.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;\n    Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,\n    Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?\n\n                     Enter BERKELEY\n \n  NORTHUMBERLAND. It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.\n  BERKELEY. My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.\n  BOLINGBROKE. My lord, my answer is-'to Lancaster';\n    And I am come to seek that name in England;\n    And I must find that title in your tongue\n    Before I make reply to aught you say.\n  BERKELEY. Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning\n    To raze one title of your honour out.\n    To you, my lord, I come-what lord you will-\n    From the most gracious regent of this land,\n    The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on\n    To take advantage of the absent time,\n    And fright our native peace with self-borne arms.\n\n                 Enter YORK, attended\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. I shall not need transport my words by you;\n    Here comes his Grace in person. My noble uncle!\n                                                     [Kneels]\n  YORK. Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee, \n    Whose duty is deceivable and false.\n  BOLINGBROKE. My gracious uncle!-\n  YORK. Tut, tut!\n    Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle.\n    I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace'\n    In an ungracious mouth is but profane.\n    Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs\n    Dar'd once to touch a dust of England's ground?\n    But then more 'why?'-why have they dar'd to march\n    So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,\n    Frighting her pale-fac'd villages with war\n    And ostentation of despised arms?\n    Com'st thou because the anointed King is hence?\n    Why, foolish boy, the King is left behind,\n    And in my loyal bosom lies his power.\n    Were I but now lord of such hot youth\n    As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself\n    Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,\n    From forth the ranks of many thousand French,\n    O, then how quickly should this arm of mine, \n    Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise the\n    And minister correction to thy fault!\n  BOLINGBROKE My gracious uncle, let me know my fault;\n    On what condition stands it and wherein?\n  YORK. Even in condition of the worst degree-\n    In gross rebellion and detested treason.\n    Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come\n    Before the expiration of thy time,\n    In braving arms against thy sovereign.\n  BOLINGBROKE. As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;\n    But as I come, I come for Lancaster.\n    And, noble uncle, I beseech your Grace\n    Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye.\n    You are my father, for methinks in you\n    I see old Gaunt alive. O, then, my father,\n    Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd\n    A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties\n    Pluck'd from my arms perforce, and given away\n    To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?\n    If that my cousin king be King in England, \n    It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.\n    You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;\n    Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,\n    He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father\n    To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.\n    I am denied to sue my livery here,\n    And yet my letters patents give me leave.\n    My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold;\n    And these and all are all amiss employ'd.\n    What would you have me do? I am a subject,\n    And I challenge law-attorneys are denied me;\n    And therefore personally I lay my claim\n    To my inheritance of free descent.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath been too much abused.\n  ROSS. It stands your Grace upon to do him right.\n  WILLOUGHBY. Base men by his endowments are made great.\n  YORK. My lords of England, let me tell you this:\n    I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs,\n    And labour'd all I could to do him right;\n    But in this kind to come, in braving arms, \n    Be his own carver and cut out his way,\n    To find out right with wrong-it may not be;\n    And you that do abet him in this kind\n    Cherish rebellion, and are rebels all.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. The noble Duke hath sworn his coming is\n    But for his own; and for the right of that\n    We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;\n    And let him never see joy that breaks that oath!\n  YORK. Well, well, I see the issue of these arms.\n    I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,\n    Because my power is weak and all ill left;\n    But if I could, by Him that gave me life,\n    I would attach you all and make you stoop\n    Unto the sovereign mercy of the King;\n    But since I cannot, be it known unto you\n    I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;\n    Unless you please to enter in the castle,\n    And there repose you for this night.\n  BOLINGBROKE. An offer, uncle, that we will accept.\n    But we must win your Grace to go with us \n    To Bristow Castle, which they say is held\n    By Bushy, Bagot, and their complices,\n    The caterpillars of the commonwealth,\n    Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.\n  YORK. It may be I will go with you; but yet I'll pause,\n    For I am loath to break our country's laws.\n    Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are.\n    Things past redress are now with me past care.        Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4.\nA camp in Wales\n\nEnter EARL OF SALISBURY and a WELSH CAPTAIN\n\n  CAPTAIN. My Lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days\n    And hardly kept our countrymen together,\n    And yet we hear no tidings from the King;\n    Therefore we will disperse ourselves. Farewell.\n  SALISBURY. Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman;\n    The King reposeth all his confidence in thee.\n  CAPTAIN. 'Tis thought the King is dead; we will not stay.\n    The bay trees in our country are all wither'd,\n    And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;\n    The pale-fac'd moon looks bloody on the earth,\n    And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;\n    Rich men look sad, and ruffians dance and leap-\n    The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,\n    The other to enjoy by rage and war.\n    These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.\n    Farewell. Our countrymen are gone and fled,\n    As well assur'd Richard their King is dead.             Exit \n  SALISBURY. Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind,\n    I see thy glory like a shooting star\n    Fall to the base earth from the firmament!\n    The sun sets weeping in the lowly west,\n    Witnessing storms to come, woe, and unrest;\n    Thy friends are fled, to wait upon thy foes;\n    And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

SCENE I.\nBOLINGBROKE'S camp at Bristol\n\nEnter BOLINGBROKE, YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, PERCY, ROSS, WILLOUGHBY,\nBUSHY and GREEN, prisoners\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. Bring forth these men.\n    Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls-\n    Since presently your souls must part your bodies-\n    With too much urging your pernicious lives,\n    For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood\n    From off my hands, here in the view of men\n    I will unfold some causes of your deaths:\n    You have misled a prince, a royal king,\n    A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,\n    By you unhappied and disfigured clean;\n    You have in manner with your sinful hours\n    Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him;\n    Broke the possession of a royal bed,\n    And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks\n    With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs;\n    Myself-a prince by fortune of my birth, \n    Near to the King in blood, and near in love\n    Till you did make him misinterpret me-\n    Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries\n    And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,\n    Eating the bitter bread of banishment,\n    Whilst you have fed upon my signories,\n    Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,\n    From my own windows torn my household coat,\n    Raz'd out my imprese, leaving me no sign\n    Save men's opinions and my living blood\n    To show the world I am a gentleman.\n    This and much more, much more than twice all this,\n    Condemns you to the death. See them delivered over\n    To execution and the hand of death.\n  BUSHY. More welcome is the stroke of death to me\n    Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.\n  GREEN. My comfort is that heaven will take our souls,\n    And plague injustice with the pains of hell.\n  BOLINGBROKE. My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.\n           Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, and others, with the prisoners \n    Uncle, you say the Queen is at your house;\n    For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated.\n    Tell her I send to her my kind commends;\n    Take special care my greetings be delivered.\n  YORK. A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd\n    With letters of your love to her at large.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Thanks, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away,\n    To fight with Glendower and his complices.\n    Awhile to work, and after holiday.                    Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\nThe coast of Wales. A castle in view\n\nDrums. Flourish and colours. Enter the KING, the BISHOP OF\nCARLISLE,\nAUMERLE, and soldiers\n\n  KING RICHARD. Barkloughly Castle can they this at hand?\n  AUMERLE. Yea, my lord. How brooks your Grace the air\n    After your late tossing on the breaking seas?\n  KING RICHARD. Needs must I like it well. I weep for joy\n    To stand upon my kingdom once again.\n    Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,\n    Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs.\n    As a long-parted mother with her child\n    Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,\n    So weeping-smiling greet I thee, my earth,\n    And do thee favours with my royal hands.\n    Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,\n    Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;\n    But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,\n    And heavy-gaited toads, lie in their way,\n    Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet \n    Which with usurping steps do trample thee;\n    Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;\n    And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,\n    Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder,\n    Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch\n    Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.\n    Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords.\n    This earth shall have a feeling, and these stones\n    Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king\n    Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.\n  CARLISLE. Fear not, my lord; that Power that made you king\n    Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.\n    The means that heaven yields must be embrac'd\n    And not neglected; else, if heaven would,\n    And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,\n    The proffered means of succour and redress.\n  AUMERLE. He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;\n    Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,\n    Grows strong and great in substance and in power.\n  KING RICHARD. Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not \n    That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,\n    Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,\n    Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen\n    In murders and in outrage boldly here;\n    But when from under this terrestrial ball\n    He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines\n    And darts his light through every guilty hole,\n    Then murders, treasons, and detested sins,\n    The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,\n    Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?\n    So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,\n    Who all this while hath revell'd in the night,\n    Whilst we were wand'ring with the Antipodes,\n    Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,\n    His treasons will sit blushing in his face,\n    Not able to endure the sight of day,\n    But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.\n    Not all the water in the rough rude sea\n    Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;\n    The breath of worldly men cannot depose \n    The deputy elected by the Lord.\n    For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd\n    To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,\n    God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay\n    A glorious angel. Then, if angels fight,\n    Weak men must fall; for heaven still guards the right.\n\n                 Enter SALISBURY\n\n    Welcome, my lord. How far off lies your power?\n  SALISBURY. Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,\n    Than this weak arm. Discomfort guides my tongue,\n    And bids me speak of nothing but despair.\n    One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,\n    Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth.\n    O, call back yesterday, bid time return,\n    And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!\n    To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,\n    O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune, and thy state;\n    For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead, \n    Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispers'd, and fled.\n  AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege, why looks your Grace so pale?\n  KING RICHARD. But now the blood of twenty thousand men\n    Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;\n    And, till so much blood thither come again,\n    Have I not reason to look pale and dead?\n    All souls that will be safe, fly from my side;\n    For time hath set a blot upon my pride.\n  AUMERLE. Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.\n  KING RICHARD. I had forgot myself; am I not King?\n    Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.\n    Is not the King's name twenty thousand names?\n    Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes\n    At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,\n    Ye favourites of a king; are we not high?\n    High be our thoughts. I know my uncle York\n    Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?\n\n                   Enter SCROOP\n \n  SCROOP. More health and happiness betide my liege\n    Than can my care-tun'd tongue deliver him.\n  KING RICHARD. Mine ear is open and my heart prepar'd.\n    The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.\n    Say, is my kingdom lost? Why, 'twas my care,\n    And what loss is it to be rid of care?\n    Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?\n    Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,\n    We'll serve him too, and be his fellow so.\n    Revolt our subjects? That we cannot mend;\n    They break their faith to God as well as us.\n    Cry woe, destruction, ruin, and decay-\n    The worst is death, and death will have his day.\n  SCROOP. Glad am I that your Highness is so arm'd\n    To bear the tidings of calamity.\n    Like an unseasonable stormy day\n    Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,\n    As if the world were all dissolv'd to tears,\n    So high above his limits swells the rage\n    Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land \n    With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.\n    White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps\n    Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,\n    Strive to speak big, and clap their female joints\n    In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown;\n    Thy very beadsmen learn to bend their bows\n    Of double-fatal yew against thy state;\n    Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills\n    Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,\n    And all goes worse than I have power to tell.\n  KING RICHARD. Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so in.\n    Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? Where is Bagot?\n    What is become of Bushy? Where is Green?\n    That they have let the dangerous enemy\n    Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?\n    If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it.\n    I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.\n  SCROOP. Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.\n  KING RICHARD. O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!\n    Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man! \n    Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!\n    Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!\n    Would they make peace? Terrible hell make war\n    Upon their spotted souls for this offence!\n  SCROOP. Sweet love, I see, changing his property,\n    Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate.\n    Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made\n    With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse\n    Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound\n    And lie full low, grav'd in the hollow ground.\n  AUMERLE. Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?\n  SCROOP. Ay, all of them at Bristow lost their heads.\n  AUMERLE. Where is the Duke my father with his power?\n  KING RICHARD. No matter where-of comfort no man speak.\n    Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;\n    Make dust our paper, and with rainy eyes\n    Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth.\n    Let's choose executors and talk of wills;\n    And yet not so-for what can we bequeath\n    Save our deposed bodies to the ground? \n    Our lands, our lives, and an, are Bolingbroke's.\n    And nothing can we can our own but death\n    And that small model of the barren earth\n    Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.\n    For God's sake let us sit upon the ground\n    And tell sad stories of the death of kings:\n    How some have been depos'd, some slain in war,\n    Some haunted by the ghosts they have depos'd,\n    Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd,\n    All murder'd-for within the hollow crown\n    That rounds the mortal temples of a king\n    Keeps Death his court; and there the antic sits,\n    Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp;\n    Allowing him a breath, a little scene,\n    To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;\n    Infusing him with self and vain conceit,\n    As if this flesh which walls about our life\n    Were brass impregnable; and, humour'd thus,\n    Comes at the last, and with a little pin\n    Bores through his castle wall, and farewell, king! \n    Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood\n    With solemn reverence; throw away respect,\n    Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty;\n    For you have but mistook me all this while.\n    I live with bread like you, feel want,\n    Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,\n    How can you say to me I am a king?\n  CARLISLE. My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,\n    But presently prevent the ways to wail.\n    To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,\n    Gives, in your weakness, strength unto your foe,\n    And so your follies fight against yourself.\n    Fear and be slain-no worse can come to fight;\n    And fight and die is death destroying death,\n    Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.\n  AUMERLE. My father hath a power; inquire of him,\n    And learn to make a body of a limb.\n  KING RICHARD. Thou chid'st me well. Proud Bolingbroke, I come\n    To change blows with thee for our day of doom.\n    This ague fit of fear is over-blown; \n    An easy task it is to win our own.\n    Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?\n    Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.\n  SCROOP. Men judge by the complexion of the sky\n    The state in inclination of the day;\n    So may you by my dull and heavy eye,\n    My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.\n    I play the torturer, by small and small\n    To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:\n    Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke;\n    And all your northern castles yielded up,\n    And all your southern gentlemen in arms\n    Upon his party.\n  KING RICHARD. Thou hast said enough.\n      [To AUMERLE] Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me\nforth\n    Of that sweet way I was in to despair!\n    What say you now? What comfort have we now?\n    By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly\n    That bids me be of comfort any more.\n    Go to Flint Castle; there I'll pine away; \n    A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.\n    That power I have, discharge; and let them go\n    To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,\n    For I have none. Let no man speak again\n    To alter this, for counsel is but vain.\n  AUMERLE. My liege, one word.\n  KING RICHARD. He does me double wrong\n    That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.\n    Discharge my followers; let them hence away,\n    From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.       Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\nWales. Before Flint Castle\n\nEnter, with drum and colours, BOLINGBROKE, YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND,\nand forces\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. So that by this intelligence we learn\n    The Welshmen are dispers'd; and Salisbury\n    Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed\n    With some few private friends upon this coast.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. The news is very fair and good, my lord.\n    Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.\n  YORK. It would beseem the Lord Northumberland\n    To say 'King Richard.' Alack the heavy day\n    When such a sacred king should hide his head!\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Your Grace mistakes; only to be brief,\n    Left I his title out.\n  YORK. The time hath been,\n    Would you have been so brief with him, he would\n    Have been so brief with you to shorten you,\n    For taking so the head, your whole head's length.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Mistake not, uncle, further than you should. \n  YORK. Take not, good cousin, further than you should,\n    Lest you mistake. The heavens are over our heads.\n  BOLINGBROKE. I know it, uncle; and oppose not myself\n    Against their will. But who comes here?\n\n                    Enter PERCY\n\n    Welcome, Harry. What, will not this castle yield?\n  PIERCY. The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,\n    Against thy entrance.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Royally!\n    Why, it contains no king?\n  PERCY. Yes, my good lord,\n    It doth contain a king; King Richard lies\n    Within the limits of yon lime and stone;\n    And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,\n    Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman\n    Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.\n  BOLINGBROKE. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] Noble lord, \n    Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;\n    Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley\n    Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:\n    Henry Bolingbroke\n    On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand,\n    And sends allegiance and true faith of heart\n    To his most royal person; hither come\n    Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,\n    Provided that my banishment repeal'd\n    And lands restor'd again be freely granted;\n    If not, I'll use the advantage of my power\n    And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood\n    Rain'd from the wounds of slaughtered Englishmen;\n    The which how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke\n    It is such crimson tempest should bedrench\n    The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,\n    My stooping duty tenderly shall show.\n    Go, signify as much, while here we march\n    Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.\n           [NORTHUMBERLAND advances to the Castle, with a\ntrumpet] \n    Let's march without the noise of threat'ning drum,\n    That from this castle's tottered battlements\n    Our fair appointments may be well perus'd.\n    Methinks King Richard and myself should meet\n    With no less terror than the elements\n    Of fire and water, when their thund'ring shock\n    At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.\n    Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water;\n    The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain\n    My waters-on the earth, and not on him.\n    March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.\n\n      Parle without, and answer within; then a flourish.\n      Enter on the walls, the KING, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,\n      AUMERLE, SCROOP, and SALISBURY\n\n    See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,\n    As doth the blushing discontented sun\n    From out the fiery portal of the east,\n    When he perceives the envious clouds are bent \n    To dim his glory and to stain the track\n    Of his bright passage to the occident.\n  YORK. Yet he looks like a king. Behold, his eye,\n    As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth\n    Controlling majesty. Alack, alack, for woe,\n    That any harm should stain so fair a show!\n  KING RICHARD. [To NORTHUMBERLAND] We are amaz'd; and thus long\n      have we stood\n    To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,\n    Because we thought ourself thy lawful King;\n    And if we be, how dare thy joints forget\n    To pay their awful duty to our presence?\n    If we be not, show us the hand of God\n    That hath dismiss'd us from our stewardship;\n    For well we know no hand of blood and bone\n    Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,\n    Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.\n    And though you think that all, as you have done,\n    Have torn their souls by turning them from us,\n    And we are barren and bereft of friends, \n    Yet know-my master, God omnipotent,\n    Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf\n    Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike\n    Your children yet unborn and unbegot,\n    That lift your vassal hands against my head\n    And threat the glory of my precious crown.\n    Tell Bolingbroke, for yon methinks he stands,\n    That every stride he makes upon my land\n    Is dangerous treason; he is come to open\n    The purple testament of bleeding war;\n    But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,\n    Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons\n    Shall ill become the flower of England's face,\n    Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace\n    To scarlet indignation, and bedew\n    Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. The King of Heaven forbid our lord the King\n    Should so with civil and uncivil arms\n    Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin,\n    Harry Bolingbroke, doth humbly kiss thy hand; \n    And by the honourable tomb he swears\n    That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,\n    And by the royalties of both your bloods,\n    Currents that spring from one most gracious head,\n    And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,\n    And by the worth and honour of himself,\n    Comprising all that may be sworn or said,\n    His coming hither hath no further scope\n    Than for his lineal royalties, and to beg\n    Enfranchisement immediate on his knees;\n    Which on thy royal party granted once,\n    His glittering arms he will commend to rust,\n    His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart\n    To faithful service of your Majesty.\n    This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;\n    And as I am a gentleman I credit him.\n  KING RICHARD. Northumberland, say thus the King returns:\n    His noble cousin is right welcome hither;\n    And all the number of his fair demands\n    Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction. \n    With all the gracious utterance thou hast\n    Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.\n    [To AUMERLE] We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,\n    To look so poorly and to speak so fair?\n    Shall we call back Northumberland, and send\n    Defiance to the traitor, and so die?\n  AUMERLE. No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words\n    Till time lend friends, and friends their helpful swords.\n  KING RICHARD. O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine\n    That laid the sentence of dread banishment\n    On yon proud man should take it off again\n    With words of sooth! O that I were as great\n    As is my grief, or lesser than my name!\n    Or that I could forget what I have been!\n    Or not remember what I must be now!\n    Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,\n    Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.\n  AUMERLE. Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.\n  KING RICHARD. What must the King do now? Must he submit?\n    The King shall do it. Must he be depos'd? \n    The King shall be contented. Must he lose\n    The name of king? A God's name, let it go.\n    I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,\n    My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,\n    My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,\n    My figur'd goblets for a dish of wood,\n    My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,\n    My subjects for a pair of carved saints,\n    And my large kingdom for a little grave,\n    A little little grave, an obscure grave-\n    Or I'll be buried in the king's high way,\n    Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet\n    May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;\n    For on my heart they tread now whilst I live,\n    And buried once, why not upon my head?\n    Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!\n    We'll make foul weather with despised tears;\n    Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn\n    And make a dearth in this revolting land.\n    Or shall we play the wantons with our woes \n    And make some pretty match with shedding tears?\n    As thus: to drop them still upon one place\n    Till they have fretted us a pair of graves\n    Within the earth; and, therein laid-there lies\n    Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.\n    Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see\n    I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.\n    Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,\n    What says King Bolingbroke? Will his Majesty\n    Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?\n    You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, in the base court he doth attend\n    To speak with you; may it please you to come down?\n  KING RICHARD. Down, down I come, like glist'ring Phaethon,\n    Wanting the manage of unruly jades.\n    In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,\n    To come at traitors' calls, and do them grace.\n    In the base court? Come down? Down, court! down, king!\n    For night-owls shriek where mounting larks should sing.\n                                               Exeunt from above \n  BOLINGBROKE. What says his Majesty?\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Sorrow and grief of heart\n    Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man;\n    Yet he is come.\n\n          Enter the KING, and his attendants, below\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. Stand all apart,\n    And show fair duty to his Majesty.   [He kneels down]\n    My gracious lord-\n  KING RICHARD. Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee\n    To make the base earth proud with kissing it.\n    Me rather had my heart might feel your love\n    Than my unpleas'd eye see your courtesy.\n    Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,\n    [Touching his own head] Thus high at least, although your\n      knee be low.\n  BOLINGBROKE. My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.\n  KING RICHARD. Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.\n  BOLINGBROKE. So far be mine, my most redoubted lord, \n    As my true service shall deserve your love.\n  KING RICHARD. Well you deserve. They well deserve to have\n    That know the strong'st and surest way to get.\n    Uncle, give me your hands; nay, dry your eyes:\n    Tears show their love, but want their remedies.\n    Cousin, I am too young to be your father,\n    Though you are old enough to be my heir.\n    What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;\n    For do we must what force will have us do.\n    Set on towards London. Cousin, is it so?\n  BOLINGBROKE. Yea, my good lord.\n  KING RICHARD. Then I must not say no.         Flourish. Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4.\nThe DUKE OF YORK's garden\n\nEnter the QUEEN and two LADIES\n\n  QUEEN. What sport shall we devise here in this garden\n    To drive away the heavy thought of care?\n  LADY. Madam, we'll play at bowls.\n  QUEEN. 'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs\n    And that my fortune runs against the bias.\n  LADY. Madam, we'll dance.\n  QUEEN. My legs can keep no measure in delight,\n    When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief;\n    Therefore no dancing, girl; some other sport.\n  LADY. Madam, we'll tell tales.\n  QUEEN. Of sorrow or of joy?\n  LADY. Of either, madam.\n  QUEEN. Of neither, girl;\n    For if of joy, being altogether wanting,\n    It doth remember me the more of sorrow;\n    Or if of grief, being altogether had,\n    It adds more sorrow to my want of joy; \n    For what I have I need not to repeat,\n    And what I want it boots not to complain.\n  LADY. Madam, I'll sing.\n  QUEEN. 'Tis well' that thou hast cause;\n    But thou shouldst please me better wouldst thou weep.\n  LADY. I could weep, madam, would it do you good.\n  QUEEN. And I could sing, would weeping do me good,\n    And never borrow any tear of thee.\n\n           Enter a GARDENER and two SERVANTS\n\n    But stay, here come the gardeners.\n    Let's step into the shadow of these trees.\n    My wretchedness unto a row of pins,\n    They will talk of state, for every one doth so\n    Against a change: woe is forerun with woe.\n                                       [QUEEN and LADIES retire]\n  GARDENER. Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,\n    Which, like unruly children, make their sire\n    Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight; \n    Give some supportance to the bending twigs.\n    Go thou, and Eke an executioner\n    Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays\n    That look too lofty in our commonwealth:\n    All must be even in our government.\n    You thus employ'd, I will go root away\n    The noisome weeds which without profit suck\n    The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.\n  SERVANT. Why should we, in the compass of a pale,\n    Keep law and form and due proportion,\n    Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,\n    When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,\n    Is full of weeds; her fairest flowers chok'd up,\n    Her fruit trees all unprun'd, her hedges ruin'd,\n    Her knots disordered, and her wholesome herbs\n    Swarming with caterpillars?\n  GARDENER. Hold thy peace.\n    He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring\n    Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf;\n    The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter, \n    That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,\n    Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke-\n    I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.\n  SERVANT. What, are they dead?\n  GARDENER. They are; and Bolingbroke\n    Hath seiz'd the wasteful King. O, what pity is it\n    That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land\n    As we this garden! We at time of year\n    Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit trees,\n    Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,\n    With too much riches it confound itself;\n    Had he done so to great and growing men,\n    They might have Ev'd to bear, and he to taste\n    Their fruits of duty. Superfluous branches\n    We lop away, that bearing boughs may live;\n    Had he done so, himself had home the crown,\n    Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.\n  SERVANT. What, think you the King shall be deposed?\n  GARDENER. Depress'd he is already, and depos'd\n    'Tis doubt he will be. Letters came last night \n    To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's\n    That tell black tidings.\n  QUEEN. O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!\n                                                [Coming forward]\n    Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,\n    How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?\n    What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested the\n    To make a second fall of cursed man?\n    Why dost thou say King Richard is depos'd?\n    Dar'st thou, thou little better thing than earth,\n    Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,\n    Cam'st thou by this ill tidings? Speak, thou wretch.\n  GARDENER. Pardon me, madam; little joy have\n    To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.\n    King Richard, he is in the mighty hold\n    Of Bolingbroke. Their fortunes both are weigh'd.\n    In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,\n    And some few vanities that make him light;\n    But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,\n    Besides himself, are all the English peers, \n    And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.\n    Post you to London, and you will find it so;\n    I speak no more than every one doth know.\n  QUEEN. Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,\n    Doth not thy embassage belong to me,\n    And am I last that knows it? O, thou thinkest\n    To serve me last, that I may longest keep\n    Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go\n    To meet at London London's King in woe.\n    What, was I born to this, that my sad look\n    Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?\n    Gard'ner, for telling me these news of woe,\n    Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow!\n                                         Exeunt QUEEN and LADIES\n  GARDENER. Poor Queen, so that thy state might be no worse,\n    I would my skill were subject to thy curse.\n    Here did she fall a tear; here in this place\n    I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace.\n    Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,\n    In the remembrance of a weeping queen.

SCENE 1.\nWestminster Hall\n\nEnter, as to the Parliament, BOLINGBROKE, AUMERLE,\nNORTHUMBERLAND, PERCY,\nFITZWATER, SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the ABBOT OF\nWESTMINSTER,\nand others; HERALD, OFFICERS, and BAGOT\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. Call forth Bagot.\n    Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind-\n    What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death;\n    Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd\n    The bloody office of his timeless end.\n  BAGOT. Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.\n  BAGOT. My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue\n    Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.\n    In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted\n    I heard you say 'Is not my arm of length,\n    That reacheth from the restful English Court\n    As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'\n    Amongst much other talk that very time \n    I heard you say that you had rather refuse\n    The offer of an hundred thousand crowns\n    Than Bolingbroke's return to England;\n    Adding withal, how blest this land would be\n    In this your cousin's death.\n  AUMERLE. Princes, and noble lords,\n    What answer shall I make to this base man?\n    Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars\n    On equal terms to give him chastisement?\n    Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd\n    With the attainder of his slanderous lips.\n    There is my gage, the manual seal of death\n    That marks thee out for hell. I say thou liest,\n    And will maintain what thou hast said is false\n    In thy heart-blood, through being all too base\n    To stain the temper of my knightly sword.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.\n  AUMERLE. Excepting one, I would he were the best\n    In all this presence that hath mov'd me so.\n  FITZWATER. If that thy valour stand on sympathy, \n    There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine.\n    By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,\n    I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spak'st it,\n    That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.\n    If thou deniest it twenty times, thou liest;\n    And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,\n    Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.\n  AUMERLE. Thou dar'st not, coward, live to see that day.\n  FITZWATER. Now, by my soul, I would it were this hour.\n  AUMERLE. Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.\n  PERCY. Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true\n    In this appeal as thou art an unjust;\n    And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,\n    To prove it on thee to the extremest point\n    Of mortal breathing. Seize it, if thou dar'st.\n  AUMERLE. An if I do not, may my hands rot of\n    And never brandish more revengeful steel\n    Over the glittering helmet of my foe!\n  ANOTHER LORD. I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;\n    And spur thee on with fun as many lies \n    As may be halloa'd in thy treacherous ear\n    From sun to sun. There is my honour's pawn;\n    Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.\n  AUMERLE. Who sets me else? By heaven, I'll throw at all!\n    I have a thousand spirits in one breast\n    To answer twenty thousand such as you.\n  SURREY. My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well\n    The very time Aumerle and you did talk.\n  FITZWATER. 'Tis very true; you were in presence then,\n    And you can witness with me this is true.\n  SURREY. As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.\n  FITZWATER. Surrey, thou liest.\n  SURREY. Dishonourable boy!\n    That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword\n    That it shall render vengeance and revenge\n    Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do he\n    In earth as quiet as thy father's skull.\n    In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;\n    Engage it to the trial, if thou dar'st.\n  FITZWATER. How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse! \n    If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,\n    I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,\n    And spit upon him whilst I say he lies,\n    And lies, and lies. There is my bond of faith,\n    To tie thee to my strong correction.\n    As I intend to thrive in this new world,\n    Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal.\n    Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say\n    That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men\n    To execute the noble Duke at Calais.\n  AUMERLE. Some honest Christian trust me with a gage\n    That Norfolk lies. Here do I throw down this,\n    If he may be repeal'd to try his honour.\n  BOLINGBROKE. These differences shall all rest under gage\n    Till Norfolk be repeal'd-repeal'd he shall be\n    And, though mine enemy, restor'd again\n    To all his lands and signories. When he is return'd,\n    Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.\n  CARLISLE. That honourable day shall never be seen.\n    Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought \n    For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,\n    Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross\n    Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens;\n    And, toil'd with works of war, retir'd himself\n    To Italy; and there, at Venice, gave\n    His body to that pleasant country's earth,\n    And his pure soul unto his captain, Christ,\n    Under whose colours he had fought so long.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Why, Bishop, is Norfolk dead?\n  CARLISLE. As surely as I live, my lord.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom\n    Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,\n    Your differences shall all rest under gage\n    Till we assign you to your days of trial\n\n                 Enter YORK, attended\n\n  YORK. Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to the\n    From plume-pluck'd Richard, who with willing soul\n    Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields \n    To the possession of thy royal hand.\n    Ascend his throne, descending now from him-\n    And long live Henry, fourth of that name!\n  BOLINGBROKE. In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.\n  CARLISLE. Marry, God forbid!\n    Worst in this royal presence may I speak,\n    Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.\n    Would God that any in this noble presence\n    Were enough noble to be upright judge\n    Of noble Richard! Then true noblesse would\n    Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.\n    What subject can give sentence on his king?\n    And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?\n    Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear,\n    Although apparent guilt be seen in them;\n    And shall the figure of God's majesty,\n    His captain, steward, deputy elect,\n    Anointed, crowned, planted many years,\n    Be judg'd by subject and inferior breath,\n    And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God, \n    That in a Christian climate souls refin'd\n    Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!\n    I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,\n    Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king.\n    My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,\n    Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king;\n    And if you crown him, let me prophesy-\n    The blood of English shall manure the ground,\n    And future ages groan for this foul act;\n    Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,\n    And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars\n    Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;\n    Disorder, horror, fear, and mutiny,\n    Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd\n    The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.\n    O, if you raise this house against this house,\n    It will the woefullest division prove\n    That ever fell upon this cursed earth.\n    Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,\n    Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe. \n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,\n    Of capital treason we arrest you here.\n    My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge\n    To keep him safely till his day of trial.\n    May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit?\n  BOLINGBROKE. Fetch hither Richard, that in common view\n    He may surrender; so we shall proceed\n    Without suspicion.\n  YORK. I will be his conduct.                              Exit\n  BOLINGBROKE. Lords, you that here are under our arrest,\n    Procure your sureties for your days of answer.\n    Little are we beholding to your love,\n    And little look'd for at your helping hands.\n\n      Re-enter YORK, with KING RICHARD, and OFFICERS\n                bearing the regalia\n\n  KING RICHARD. Alack, why am I sent for to a king,\n    Before I have shook off the regal thoughts\n    Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd \n    To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my knee.\n    Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me\n    To this submission. Yet I well remember\n    The favours of these men. Were they not mine?\n    Did they not sometime cry 'All hail!' to me?\n    So Judas did to Christ; but he, in twelve,\n    Found truth in all but one; I, in twelve thousand, none.\n    God save the King! Will no man say amen?\n    Am I both priest and clerk? Well then, amen.\n    God save the King! although I be not he;\n    And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.\n    To do what service am I sent for hither?\n  YORK. To do that office of thine own good will\n    Which tired majesty did make thee offer-\n    The resignation of thy state and crown\n    To Henry Bolingbroke.\n  KING RICHARD. Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown.\n    Here, cousin,\n    On this side my hand, and on that side thine.\n    Now is this golden crown like a deep well \n    That owes two buckets, filling one another;\n    The emptier ever dancing in the air,\n    The other down, unseen, and full of water.\n    That bucket down and fun of tears am I,\n    Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.\n  BOLINGBROKE. I thought you had been willing to resign.\n  KING RICHARD. My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine.\n    You may my glories and my state depose,\n    But not my griefs; still am I king of those.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Part of your cares you give me with your crown.\n  KING RICHARD. Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.\n    My care is loss of care, by old care done;\n    Your care is gain of care, by new care won.\n    The cares I give I have, though given away;\n    They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Are you contented to resign the crown?\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;\n    Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.\n    Now mark me how I will undo myself:\n    I give this heavy weight from off my head, \n    And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,\n    The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;\n    With mine own tears I wash away my balm,\n    With mine own hands I give away my crown,\n    With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,\n    With mine own breath release all duteous oaths;\n    All pomp and majesty I do forswear;\n    My manors, rents, revenues, I forgo;\n    My acts, decrees, and statutes, I deny.\n    God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!\n    God keep all vows unbroke are made to thee!\n    Make me, that nothing have, with nothing griev'd,\n    And thou with all pleas'd, that hast an achiev'd.\n    Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,\n    And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit.\n    God save King Henry, unking'd Richard says,\n    And send him many years of sunshine days!\n    What more remains?\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. No more; but that you read\n    These accusations, and these grievous crimes \n    Committed by your person and your followers\n    Against the state and profit of this land;\n    That, by confessing them, the souls of men\n    May deem that you are worthily depos'd.\n  KING RICHARD. Must I do so? And must I ravel out\n    My weav'd-up follies? Gentle Northumberland,\n    If thy offences were upon record,\n    Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop\n    To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,\n    There shouldst thou find one heinous article,\n    Containing the deposing of a king\n    And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,\n    Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven.\n    Nay, all of you that stand and look upon me\n    Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,\n    Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands,\n    Showing an outward pity-yet you Pilates\n    Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,\n    And water cannot wash away your sin.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, dispatch; read o'er these \n    articles.\n  KING RICHARD. Mine eyes are full of tears; I cannot see.\n    And yet salt water blinds them not so much\n    But they can see a sort of traitors here.\n    Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,\n    I find myself a traitor with the rest;\n    For I have given here my soul's consent\n    T'undeck the pompous body of a king;\n    Made glory base, and sovereignty a slave,\n    Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord-\n  KING RICHARD. No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,\n    Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no tide-\n    No, not that name was given me at the font-\n    But 'tis usurp'd. Alack the heavy day,\n    That I have worn so many winters out,\n    And know not now what name to call myself!\n    O that I were a mockery king of snow,\n    Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke\n    To melt myself away in water drops! \n    Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,\n    An if my word be sterling yet in England,\n    Let it command a mirror hither straight,\n    That it may show me what a face I have\n    Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.\n                                               Exit an attendant\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.\n  KING RICHARD. Fiend, thou torments me ere I come to hell.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. The Commons will not, then, be satisfied.\n  KING RICHARD. They shall be satisfied. I'll read enough,\n    When I do see the very book indeed\n    Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.\n\n                Re-enter attendant with glass\n\n    Give me that glass, and therein will I read.\n    No deeper wrinkles yet? Hath sorrow struck\n    So many blows upon this face of mine \n    And made no deeper wounds? O flatt'ring glass,\n    Like to my followers in prosperity,\n    Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face\n    That every day under his household roof\n    Did keep ten thousand men? Was this the face\n    That like the sun did make beholders wink?\n    Is this the face which fac'd so many follies\n    That was at last out-fac'd by Bolingbroke?\n    A brittle glory shineth in this face;\n    As brittle as the glory is the face;\n                        [Dashes the glass against the ground]\n    For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.\n    Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport-\n    How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.\n  BOLINGBROKE. The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd\n    The shadow of your face.\n  KING RICHARD. Say that again.\n    The shadow of my sorrow? Ha! let's see.\n    'Tis very true: my grief lies all within;\n    And these external manner of laments \n    Are merely shadows to the unseen grief\n    That swells with silence in the tortur'd soul.\n    There lies the substance; and I thank thee, king,\n    For thy great bounty, that not only giv'st\n    Me cause to wail, but teachest me the way\n    How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,\n    And then be gone and trouble you no more.\n    Shall I obtain it?\n  BOLINGBROKE. Name it, fair cousin.\n  KING RICHARD. Fair cousin! I am greater than a king;\n    For when I was a king, my flatterers\n    Were then but subjects; being now a subject,\n    I have a king here to my flatterer.\n    Being so great, I have no need to beg.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Yet ask.\n  KING RICHARD. And shall I have?\n  BOLINGBROKE. You shall.\n  KING RICHARD. Then give me leave to go.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Whither?\n  KING RICHARD. Whither you will, so I were from your sights. \n  BOLINGBROKE. Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.\n  KING RICHARD. O, good! Convey! Conveyers are you all,\n    That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.\n                     Exeunt KING RICHARD, some Lords and a Guard\n  BOLINGBROKE. On Wednesday next we solemnly set down\n    Our coronation. Lords, prepare yourselves.\n                    Exeunt all but the ABBOT OF WESTMINSTER, the\n                                 BISHOP OF CARLISLE, and AUMERLE\n  ABBOT. A woeful pageant have we here beheld.\n  CARLISLE. The woe's to come; the children yet unborn\n    Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.\n  AUMERLE. You holy clergymen, is there no plot\n    To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?\n  ABBOT. My lord,\n    Before I freely speak my mind herein,\n    You shall not only take the sacrament\n    To bury mine intents, but also to effect\n    Whatever I shall happen to devise.\n    I see your brows are full of discontent,\n    Your hearts of sorrow, and your eyes of tears. \n    Come home with me to supper; I will lay\n    A plot shall show us all a merry day.

A street leading to the Tower\n\nEnter the QUEEN, with her attendants\n\n  QUEEN. This way the King will come; this is the way\n    To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,\n    To whose flint bosom my condemned lord\n    Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke.\n    Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth\n    Have any resting for her true King's queen.\n\n            Enter KING RICHARD and Guard\n\n    But soft, but see, or rather do not see,\n    My fair rose wither. Yet look up, behold,\n    That you in pity may dissolve to dew,\n    And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.\n    Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand;\n    Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,\n    And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,\n    Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodg'd in thee, \n    When triumph is become an alehouse guest?\n  KING RICHARD. Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,\n    To make my end too sudden. Learn, good soul,\n    To think our former state a happy dream;\n    From which awak'd, the truth of what we are\n    Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,\n    To grim Necessity; and he and\n    Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France,\n    And cloister thee in some religious house.\n    Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,\n    Which our profane hours here have thrown down.\n  QUEEN. What, is my Richard both in shape and mind\n    Transform'd and weak'ned? Hath Bolingbroke depos'd\n    Thine intellect? Hath he been in thy heart?\n    The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw\n    And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage\n    To be o'erpow'r'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,\n    Take the correction mildly, kiss the rod,\n    And fawn on rage with base humility,\n    Which art a lion and the king of beasts? \n  KING RICHARD. A king of beasts, indeed! If aught but beasts,\n    I had been still a happy king of men.\n    Good sometimes queen, prepare thee hence for France.\n    Think I am dead, and that even here thou takest,\n    As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.\n    In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire\n    With good old folks, and let them tell thee tales\n    Of woeful ages long ago betid;\n    And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs\n    Tell thou the lamentable tale of me,\n    And send the hearers weeping to their beds;\n    For why, the senseless brands will sympathize\n    The heavy accent of thy moving tongue,\n    And in compassion weep the fire out;\n    And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,\n    For the deposing of a rightful king.\n\n             Enter NORTHUMBERLAND attended\n\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is chang'd; \n    You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.\n    And, madam, there is order ta'en for you:\n    With all swift speed you must away to France.\n  KING RICHARD. Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal\n    The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,\n    The time shall not be many hours of age\n    More than it is, ere foul sin gathering head\n    Shall break into corruption. Thou shalt think\n    Though he divide the realm and give thee half\n    It is too little, helping him to all;\n    And he shall think that thou, which knowest the way\n    To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,\n    Being ne'er so little urg'd, another way\n    To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.\n    The love of wicked men converts to fear;\n    That fear to hate; and hate turns one or both\n    To worthy danger and deserved death.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. My guilt be on my head, and there an end.\n    Take leave, and part; for you must part forthwith.\n  KING RICHARD. Doubly divorc'd! Bad men, you violate \n    A twofold marriage-'twixt my crown and me,\n    And then betwixt me and my married wife.\n    Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;\n    And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.\n    Part us, Northumberland; I towards the north,\n    Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;\n    My wife to France, from whence set forth in pomp,\n    She came adorned hither like sweet May,\n    Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.\n  QUEEN. And must we be divided? Must we part?\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from\nheart.\n  QUEEN. Banish us both, and send the King with me.\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. That were some love, but little policy.\n  QUEEN. Then whither he goes thither let me go.\n  KING RICHARD. So two, together weeping, make one woe.\n    Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;\n    Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.\n    Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.\n  QUEEN. So longest way shall have the longest moans.\n  KING RICHARD. Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being\nshort, \n    And piece the way out with a heavy heart.\n    Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,\n    Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief.\n    One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;\n    Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.\n  QUEEN. Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part\n    To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.\n    So, now I have mine own again, be gone.\n    That I may strive to kill it with a groan.\n  KING RICHARD. We make woe wanton with this fond delay.\n    Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.            Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\nThe DUKE OF YORK's palace\n\nEnter the DUKE OF YORK and the DUCHESS\n\n  DUCHESS. My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest,\n    When weeping made you break the story off,\n    Of our two cousins' coming into London.\n  YORK. Where did I leave?\n  DUCHESS. At that sad stop, my lord,\n    Where rude misgoverned hands from windows' tops\n    Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.\n  YORK. Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bolingbroke,\n    Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed\n    Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,\n    With slow but stately pace kept on his course,\n    Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee, Bolingbroke!'\n    You would have thought the very windows spake,\n    So many greedy looks of young and old\n    Through casements darted their desiring eyes\n    Upon his visage; and that all the walls\n    With painted imagery had said at once \n    'Jesu preserve thee! Welcome, Bolingbroke!'\n    Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,\n    Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,\n    Bespake them thus, 'I thank you, countrymen.'\n    And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.\n  DUCHESS. Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?\n  YORK. As in a theatre the eyes of men\n    After a well-grac'd actor leaves the stage\n    Are idly bent on him that enters next,\n    Thinking his prattle to be tedious;\n    Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes\n    Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'\n    No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home;\n    But dust was thrown upon his sacred head;\n    Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,\n    His face still combating with tears and smiles,\n    The badges of his grief and patience,\n    That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd\n    The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,\n    And barbarism itself have pitied him. \n    But heaven hath a hand in these events,\n    To whose high will we bound our calm contents.\n    To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,\n    Whose state and honour I for aye allow.\n  DUCHESS. Here comes my son Aumerle.\n  YORK. Aumerle that was\n    But that is lost for being Richard's friend,\n    And madam, you must call him Rudand now.\n    I am in Parliament pledge for his truth\n    And lasting fealty to the new-made king.\n\n                  Enter AUMERLE\n\n  DUCHESS. Welcome, my son. Who are the violets now\n    That strew the green lap of the new come spring?\n  AUMERLE. Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not.\n    God knows I had as lief be none as one.\n  YORK. Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,\n    Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.\n    What news from Oxford? Do these justs and triumphs hold? \n  AUMERLE. For aught I know, my lord, they do.\n  YORK. You will be there, I know.\n  AUMERLE. If God prevent not, I purpose so.\n  YORK. What seal is that that without thy bosom?\n    Yea, look'st thou pale? Let me see the writing.\n  AUMERLE. My lord, 'tis nothing.\n  YORK. No matter, then, who see it.\n    I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.\n  AUMERLE. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me;\n    It is a matter of small consequence\n    Which for some reasons I would not have seen.\n  YORK. Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.\n    I fear, I fear-\n  DUCHESS. What should you fear?\n    'Tis nothing but some bond that he is ent'red into\n    For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph-day.\n  YORK. Bound to himself! What doth he with a bond\n    That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.\n    Boy, let me see the writing.\n  AUMERLE. I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it. \n  YORK. I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.\n                [He plucks it out of his bosom, and reads it]\n    Treason, foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!\n  DUCHESS. What is the matter, my lord?\n  YORK. Ho! who is within there?\n\n                    Enter a servant\n\n    Saddle my horse.\n    God for his mercy, what treachery is here!\n  DUCHESS. Why, York, what is it, my lord?\n  YORK. Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.\n                                                    Exit servant\n    Now, by mine honour, by my life, my troth,\n    I will appeach the villain.\n  DUCHESS. What is the matter?\n  YORK. Peace, foolish woman.\n  DUCHESS. I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle?\n  AUMERLE. Good mother, be content; it is no more\n    Than my poor life must answer. \n  DUCHESS. Thy life answer!\n  YORK. Bring me my boots. I will unto the King.\n\n              His man enters with his boots\n\n  DUCHESS. Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amaz'd.\n    Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.\n  YORK. Give me my boots, I say.\n  DUCHESS. Why, York, what wilt thou do?\n    Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?\n    Have we more sons? or are we like to have?\n    Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?\n    And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age\n    And rob me of a happy mother's name?\n    Is he not like thee? Is he not thine own?\n  YORK. Thou fond mad woman,\n    Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?\n    A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,\n    And interchangeably set down their hands\n    To kill the King at Oxford. \n  DUCHESS. He shall be none;\n    We'll keep him here. Then what is that to him?\n  YORK. Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son\n    I would appeach him.\n  DUCHESS. Hadst thou groan'd for him\n    As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.\n    But now I know thy mind: thou dost suspect\n    That I have been disloyal to thy bed\n    And that he is a bastard, not thy son.\n    Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind.\n    He is as like thee as a man may be\n    Not like to me, or any of my kin,\n    And yet I love him.\n  YORK. Make way, unruly woman!                             Exit\n  DUCHESS. After, Aumerle! Mount thee upon his horse;\n    Spur post, and get before him to the King,\n    And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.\n    I'll not be long behind; though I be old,\n    I doubt not but to ride as fast as York;\n    And never will I rise up from the ground \n    Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone.\n                                                          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\nWindsor Castle\n\nEnter BOLINGBROKE as King, PERCY, and other LORDS\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?\n    'Tis full three months since I did see him last.\n    If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.\n    I would to God, my lords, he might be found.\n    Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,\n    For there, they say, he daily doth frequent\n    With unrestrained loose companions,\n    Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes\n    And beat our watch and rob our passengers,\n    Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,\n    Takes on the point of honour to support\n    So dissolute a crew.\n  PERCY. My lord, some two days since I saw the Prince,\n    And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.\n  BOLINGBROKE. And what said the gallant?\n  PERCY. His answer was, he would unto the stews,\n    And from the common'st creature pluck a glove \n    And wear it as a favour; and with that\n    He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.\n  BOLINGBROKE. As dissolute as desperate; yet through both\n    I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years\n    May happily bring forth. But who comes here?\n\n                Enter AUMERLE amazed\n\n  AUMERLE. Where is the King?\n  BOLINGBROKE. What means our cousin that he stares and looks\n    So wildly?\n  AUMERLE. God save your Grace! I do beseech your Majesty,\n    To have some conference with your Grace alone.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.\n                                          Exeunt PERCY and LORDS\n    What is the matter with our cousin now?\n  AUMERLE. For ever may my knees grow to the earth,\n                                                    [Kneels]\n    My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth,\n    Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak. \n  BOLINGBROKE. Intended or committed was this fault?\n    If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,\n    To win thy after-love I pardon thee.\n  AUMERLE. Then give me leave that I may turn the key,\n    That no man enter till my tale be done.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Have thy desire.\n            [The DUKE OF YORK knocks at the door and crieth]\n  YORK. [Within] My liege, beware; look to thyself;\n    Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.\n  BOLINGBROKE. [Drawing] Villain, I'll make thee safe.\n  AUMERLE. Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.\n  YORK. [Within] Open the door, secure, foolhardy King.\n    Shall I, for love, speak treason to thy face?\n    Open the door, or I will break it open.\n\n                    Enter YORK\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. What is the matter, uncle? Speak;\n    Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,\n    That we may arm us to encounter it.\n  YORK. Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know \n    The treason that my haste forbids me show.\n  AUMERLE. Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd.\n    I do repent me; read not my name there;\n    My heart is not confederate with my hand.\n  YORK. It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.\n    I tore it from the traitor's bosom, King;\n    Fear, and not love, begets his penitence.\n    Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove\n    A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.\n  BOLINGBROKE. O heinous, strong, and bold conspiracy!\n    O loyal father of a treacherous son!\n    Thou sheer, immaculate, and silver fountain,\n    From whence this stream through muddy passages\n    Hath held his current and defil'd himself!\n    Thy overflow of good converts to bad;\n    And thy abundant goodness shall excuse\n    This deadly blot in thy digressing son.\n  YORK. So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;\n    And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,\n    As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold. \n    Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,\n    Or my sham'd life in his dishonour lies.\n    Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,\n    The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.\n  DUCHESS. [Within] I What ho, my liege, for God's sake, let me\nin.\n  BOLINGBROKE. What shrill-voic'd suppliant makes this eager cry?\n  DUCHESS. [Within] A woman, and thine aunt, great King; 'tis I.\n    Speak with me, pity me, open the door.\n    A beggar begs that never begg'd before.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Our scene is alt'red from a serious thing,\n    And now chang'd to 'The Beggar and the King.'\n    My dangerous cousin, let your mother in.\n    I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.\n  YORK. If thou do pardon whosoever pray,\n    More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.\n    This fest'red joint cut off, the rest rest sound;\n    This let alone will all the rest confound.\n\n                 Enter DUCHESS\n \n  DUCHESS. O King, believe not this hard-hearted man!\n    Love loving not itself, none other can.\n  YORK. Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?\n    Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?\n  DUCHESS. Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.\n                                                     [Kneels]\n  BOLINGBROKE. Rise up, good aunt.\n  DUCHESS. Not yet, I thee beseech.\n    For ever will I walk upon my knees,\n    And never see day that the happy sees\n    Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy\n    By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.\n  AUMERLE. Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.\n                                                     [Kneels]\n  YORK. Against them both, my true joints bended be.\n                                                     [Kneels]\n    Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!\n  DUCHESS. Pleads he in earnest? Look upon his face;\n    His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;\n    His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast. \n    He prays but faintly and would be denied;\n    We pray with heart and soul, and all beside.\n    His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;\n    Our knees still kneel till to the ground they grow.\n    His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;\n    Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.\n    Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have\n    That mercy which true prayer ought to have.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Good aunt, stand up.\n  DUCHESS. do not say 'stand up';\n    Say 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'\n    An if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,\n    'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.\n    I never long'd to hear a word till now;\n    Say 'pardon,' King; let pity teach thee how.\n    The word is short, but not so short as sweet;\n    No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.\n  YORK. Speak it in French, King, say 'pardonne moy.'\n  DUCHESS. Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?\n    Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord, \n    That sets the word itself against the word!\n    Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;\n    The chopping French we do not understand.\n    Thine eye begins to speak, set thy tongue there;\n    Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear,\n    That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,\n    Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Good aunt, stand up.\n  DUCHESS. I do not sue to stand;\n    Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.\n  BOLINGBROKE. I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.\n  DUCHESS. O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!\n    Yet am I sick for fear. Speak it again.\n    Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,\n    But makes one pardon strong.\n  BOLINGBROKE. With all my heart\n    I pardon him.\n  DUCHESS. A god on earth thou art.\n  BOLINGBROKE. But for our trusty brother-in-law and the Abbot,\n    With all the rest of that consorted crew, \n    Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.\n    Good uncle, help to order several powers\n    To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are.\n    They shall not live within this world, I swear,\n    But I will have them, if I once know where.\n    Uncle, farewell; and, cousin, adieu;\n    Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.\n  DUCHESS. Come, my old son; I pray God make thee new.     \nExeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4.\nWindsor Castle\n\nEnter SIR PIERCE OF EXTON and a servant\n\n  EXTON. Didst thou not mark the King, what words he spake?\n    'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'\n    Was it not so?\n  SERVANT. These were his very words.\n  EXTON. 'Have I no friend?' quoth he. He spake it twice\n    And urg'd it twice together, did he not?\n  SERVANT. He did.\n  EXTON. And, speaking it, he wishtly look'd on me,\n    As who should say 'I would thou wert the man\n    That would divorce this terror from my heart';\n    Meaning the King at Pomfret. Come, let's go.\n    I am the King's friend, and will rid his foe.         Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 5.\nPomfret Castle. The dungeon of the Castle\n\nEnter KING RICHARD\n\n  KING RICHARD. I have been studying how I may compare\n    This prison where I live unto the world\n    And, for because the world is populous\n    And here is not a creature but myself,\n    I cannot do it. Yet I'll hammer it out.\n    My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,\n    My soul the father; and these two beget\n    A generation of still-breeding thoughts,\n    And these same thoughts people this little world,\n    In humours like the people of this world,\n    For no thought is contented. The better sort,\n    As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd\n    With scruples, and do set the word itself\n    Against the word,\n    As thus: 'Come, little ones'; and then again,\n    'It is as hard to come as for a camel\n    To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.' \n    Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot\n    Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails\n    May tear a passage through the flinty ribs\n    Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;\n    And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.\n    Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves\n    That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,\n    Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars\n    Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,\n    That many have and others must sit there;\n    And in this thought they find a kind of ease,\n    Bearing their own misfortunes on the back\n    Of such as have before endur'd the like.\n    Thus play I in one person many people,\n    And none contented. Sometimes am I king;\n    Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,\n    And so I am. Then crushing penury\n    Persuades me I was better when a king;\n    Then am I king'd again; and by and by\n    Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke, \n    And straight am nothing. But whate'er I be,\n    Nor I, nor any man that but man is,\n    With nothing shall be pleas'd till he be eas'd\n    With being nothing.                    [The music plays]\n    Music do I hear?\n    Ha, ha! keep time. How sour sweet music is\n    When time is broke and no proportion kept!\n    So is it in the music of men's lives.\n    And here have I the daintiness of ear\n    To check time broke in a disorder'd string;\n    But, for the concord of my state and time,\n    Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.\n    I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;\n    For now hath time made me his numb'ring clock:\n    My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar\n    Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,\n    Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,\n    Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.\n    Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is\n    Are clamorous groans which strike upon my heart, \n    Which is the bell. So sighs, and tears, and groans,\n    Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time\n    Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,\n    While I stand fooling here, his Jack of the clock.\n    This music mads me. Let it sound no more;\n    For though it have holp madmen to their wits,\n    In me it seems it will make wise men mad.\n    Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!\n    For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard\n    Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.\n\n              Enter a GROOM of the stable\n\n  GROOM. Hail, royal Prince!\n  KING RICHARD. Thanks, noble peer!\n    The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.\n    What art thou? and how comest thou hither,\n    Where no man never comes but that sad dog\n    That brings me food to make misfortune live?\n  GROOM. I was a poor groom of thy stable, King, \n    When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,\n    With much ado at length have gotten leave\n    To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.\n    O, how it ern'd my heart, when I beheld,\n    In London streets, that coronation-day,\n    When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary-\n    That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,\n    That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!\n  KING RICHARD. Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,\n    How went he under him?\n  GROOM. So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.\n  KING RICHARD. So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!\n    That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;\n    This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.\n    Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,\n    Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck\n    Of that proud man that did usurp his back?\n    Forgiveness, horse! Why do I rail on thee,\n    Since thou, created to be aw'd by man,\n    Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse; \n    And yet I bear a burden like an ass,\n    Spurr'd, gall'd, and tir'd, by jauncing Bolingbroke.\n\n              Enter KEEPER with meat\n\n  KEEPER. Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.\n  KING RICHARD. If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.\n  GROOM. my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.\n Exit\n  KEEPER. My lord, will't please you to fall to?\n  KING RICHARD. Taste of it first as thou art wont to do.\n  KEEPER. My lord, I dare not. Sir Pierce of Exton,\n    Who lately came from the King, commands the contrary.\n  KING RICHARD. The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!\n    Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.\n                                           [Beats the KEEPER]\n  KEEPER. Help, help, help!\n    The murderers, EXTON and servants, rush in, armed\n  KING RICHARD. How now! What means death in this rude assault?\n    Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument. \n                         [Snatching a weapon and killing one]\n    Go thou and fill another room in hell.\n              [He kills another, then EXTON strikes him down]\n    That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire\n    That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand\n    Hath with the King's blood stain'd the King's own land.\n    Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;\n    Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.\n                                                       [Dies]\n  EXTON. As full of valour as of royal blood.\n    Both have I spill'd. O, would the deed were good!\n    For now the devil, that told me I did well,\n    Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.\n    This dead King to the living King I'll bear.\n    Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.       Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 6.\nWindsor Castle\n\nFlourish. Enter BOLINGBROKE, the DUKE OF YORK, With other LORDS\nand attendants\n\n  BOLINGBROKE. Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear\n    Is that the rebels have consum'd with fire\n    Our town of Ciceter in Gloucestershire;\n    But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.\n\n              Enter NORTHUMBERLAND\n\n    Welcome, my lord. What is the news?\n  NORTHUMBERLAND. First, to thy sacred state wish I all\nhappiness.\n    The next news is, I have to London sent\n    The heads of Salisbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent.\n    The manner of their taking may appear\n    At large discoursed in this paper here.\n  BOLINGBROKE. We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;\n    And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.\n \n                  Enter FITZWATER\n\n  FITZWATER. My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London\n    The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely;\n    Two of the dangerous consorted traitors\n    That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;\n    Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.\n\n         Enter PERCY, With the BISHOP OF CARLISLE\n\n  PERCY. The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,\n    With clog of conscience and sour melancholy,\n    Hath yielded up his body to the grave;\n    But here is Carlisle living, to abide\n    Thy kingly doom, and sentence of his pride.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Carlisle, this is your doom:\n    Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,\n    More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;\n    So as thou liv'st in peace, die free from strife; \n    For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,\n    High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.\n\n      Enter EXTON, with attendants, hearing a coffin\n\n  EXTON. Great King, within this coffin I present\n    Thy buried fear. Herein all breathless lies\n    The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,\n    Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.\n  BOLINGBROKE. Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought\n    A deed of slander with thy fatal hand\n    Upon my head and all this famous land.\n  EXTON. From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.\n  BOLINGBROKE. They love not poison that do poison need,\n    Nor do I thee. Though I did wish him dead,\n    I hate the murderer, love him murdered.\n    The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,\n    But neither my good word nor princely favour;\n    With Cain go wander thorough shades of night,\n    And never show thy head by day nor light. \n    Lords, I protest my soul is full of woe\n    That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow.\n    Come, mourn with me for what I do lament,\n    And put on sullen black incontinent.\n    I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,\n    To wash this blood off from my guilty hand.\n    March sadly after; grace my mournings here\n    In weeping after this untimely bier.

Doubtful it stood,\n    As two spent swimmers that do cling together\n    And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald-\n    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that\n    The multiplying villainies of nature\n    Do swarm upon him -from the Western Isles\n    Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;\n    And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling, \n    Show\'d like a rebel\'s whore. But all\'s too weak;\n    For brave Macbeth -well he deserves that name-\n    Disdaining Fortune, with his brandish\'d steel,\n    Which smoked with bloody execution,\n    Like Valor\'s minion carved out his passage\n    Till he faced the slave,\n    Which ne\'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,\n    Till he unseam\'d him from the nave to the chaps,\n    And fix\'d his head upon our battlements.\n  DUNCAN. O valiant cousin! Worthy gentleman!\n  SERGEANT. As whence the sun \'gins his reflection\n    Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,\n    So from that spring whence comfort seem\'d to come\n    Discomfort swells. Mark, King of Scotland, mark.\n    No sooner justice had, with valor arm\'d,\n    Compell\'d these skipping kerns to trust their heels,\n    But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,\n    With furbish\'d arms and new supplies of men,\n    Began a fresh assault.\n  DUNCAN. Dismay\'d not this \n    Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo.?\n  SERGEANT. Yes,\n    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.\n    If I say sooth, I must report they were\n    As cannons overcharged with double cracks,\n    So they\n    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.\n    Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,\n    Or memorize another Golgotha,\n    I cannot tell-\n    But I am faint; my gashes cry for help.\n  DUNCAN. So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;\n    They smack of honor both. Go get him surgeons.\n                                        Exit Sergeant, attended.\n    Who comes here?\n\n                       Enter Ross.\n\n  MALCOLM The worthy Thane of Ross.\n  LENNOX. What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look \n    That seems to speak things strange.\n  ROSS. God save the King!\n  DUNCAN. Whence camest thou, worthy Thane?\n  ROSS. From Fife, great King,\n    Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky\n    And fan our people cold.\n    Norway himself, with terrible numbers,\n    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor\n    The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,\n    Till that Bellona\'s bridegroom, lapp\'d in proof,\n    Confronted him with self-comparisons,\n    Point against point rebellious, arm \'gainst arm,\n    Curbing his lavish spirit; and, to conclude,\n    The victory fell on us.\n  DUNCAN. Great happiness!\n  ROSS. That now\n    Sweno, the Norways\' king, craves composition;\n    Nor would we deign him burial of his men\n    Till he disbursed, at Saint Colme\'s Inch,\n    Ten thousand dollars to our general use. \n  DUNCAN. No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive\n    Our bosom interest. Go pronounce his present death,\n    And with his former title greet Macbeth.\n  ROSS. I\'ll see it done.\n  DUNCAN. What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nA heath. Thunder.\n\nEnter the three Witches.\n\n  FIRST WITCH. Where hast thou been, sister?\n  SECOND WITCH. Killing swine.\n  THIRD WITCH. Sister, where thou?\n  FIRST WITCH. A sailor\'s wife had chestnuts in her lap,\n    And mounch\'d, and mounch\'d, and mounch\'d. "Give me," quoth I.\n    "Aroint thee, witch!" the rump-fed ronyon cries.\n    Her husband\'s to Aleppo gone, master the Tiger;\n    But in a sieve I\'ll thither sail,\n    And, like a rat without a tail,\n    I\'ll do, I\'ll do, and I\'ll do.\n  SECOND WITCH. I\'ll give thee a wind.\n  FIRST WITCH. Thou\'rt kind.\n  THIRD WITCH. And I another.\n  FIRST WITCH. I myself have all the other,\n    And the very ports they blow,\n    All the quarters that they know\n    I\' the shipman\'s card. \n    I will drain him dry as hay:\n    Sleep shall neither night nor day\n    Hang upon his penthouse lid;\n    He shall live a man forbid.\n    Weary se\'nnights nine times nine\n    Shall he dwindle, peak, and pine;\n    Though his bark cannot be lost,\n    Yet it shall be tempest-toss\'d.\n    Look what I have.\n  SECOND WITCH. Show me, show me.\n  FIRST WITCH. Here I have a pilot\'s thumb,\n    Wreck\'d as homeward he did come.                Drum within.\n  THIRD WITCH. A drum, a drum!\n    Macbeth doth come.\n  ALL. The weird sisters, hand in hand,\n    Posters of the sea and land,\n    Thus do go about, about,\n    Thrice to thine, and thrice to mine,\n    And thrice again, to make up nine.\n    Peace! The charm\'s wound up. \n\n                 Enter Macbeth and Banquo.\n\n  MACBETH. So foul and fair a day I have not seen.\n  BANQUO. How far is\'t call\'d to Forres? What are these\n    So wither\'d and so wild in their attire,\n    That look not like the inhabitants o\' the earth,\n    And yet are on\'t? Live you? or are you aught\n    That man may question? You seem to understand me,\n    By each at once her choppy finger laying\n    Upon her skinny lips. You should be women,\n    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret\n    That you are so.\n  MACBETH. Speak, if you can. What are you?\n  FIRST WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Glamis!\n  SECOND WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor!\n  THIRD WITCH. All hail, Macbeth, that shalt be King hereafter!\n  BANQUO. Good sir, why do you start, and seem to fear\n    Things that do sound so fair? I\' the name of truth,\n    Are ye fantastical or that indeed \n    Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner\n    You greet with present grace and great prediction\n    Of noble having and of royal hope,\n    That he seems rapt withal. To me you speak not.\n    If you can look into the seeds of time,\n    And say which grain will grow and which will not,\n    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear\n    Your favors nor your hate.\n  FIRST WITCH. Hail!\n  SECOND WITCH. Hail!\n  THIRD WITCH. Hail!\n  FIRST WITCH. Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.\n  SECOND WITCH. Not so happy, yet much happier.\n  THIRD WITCH. Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none.\n    So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!\n  FIRST WITCH. Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!\n  MACBETH. Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more.\n    By Sinel\'s death I know I am Thane of Glamis;\n    But how of Cawdor? The Thane of Cawdor lives,\n    A prosperous gentleman; and to be King \n    Stands not within the prospect of belief,\n    No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence\n    You owe this strange intelligence, or why\n    Upon this blasted heath you stop our way\n    With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.\n                                                 Witches vanish.\n  BANQUO. The earth hath bubbles as the water has,\n    And these are of them. Whither are they vanish\'d?\n  MACBETH. Into the air, and what seem\'d corporal melted\n    As breath into the wind. Would they had stay\'d!\n  BANQUO. Were such things here as we do speak about?\n    Or have we eaten on the insane root\n    That takes the reason prisoner?\n  MACBETH. Your children shall be kings.\n  BANQUO. You shall be King.\n  MACBETH. And Thane of Cawdor too. Went it not so?\n  BANQUO. To the selfsame tune and words. Who\'s here?\n\n                Enter Ross and Angus.\n \n  ROSS. The King hath happily received, Macbeth,\n    The news of thy success; and when he reads\n    Thy personal venture in the rebels\' fight,\n    His wonders and his praises do contend\n    Which should be thine or his. Silenced with that,\n    In viewing o\'er the rest o\' the selfsame day,\n    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,\n    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,\n    Strange images of death. As thick as hail\n    Came post with post, and every one did bear\n    Thy praises in his kingdom\'s great defense,\n    And pour\'d them down before him.\n  ANGUS. We are sent\n    To give thee, from our royal master, thanks;\n    Only to herald thee into his sight,\n    Not pay thee.\n  ROSS. And for an earnest of a greater honor,\n    He bade me, from him, call thee Thane of Cawdor.\n    In which addition, hail, most worthy Thane,\n    For it is thine. \n  BANQUO. What, can the devil speak true?\n  MACBETH. The Thane of Cawdor lives. Why do you dress me\n    In borrow\'d robes?\n  ANGUS. Who was the Thane lives yet,\n    But under heavy judgement bears that life\n    Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined\n    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel\n    With hidden help and vantage, or that with both\n    He labor\'d in his country\'s wreck, I know not;\n    But treasons capital, confess\'d and proved,\n    Have overthrown him.\n  MACBETH. [Aside.] Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor!\n    The greatest is behind. [To Ross and Angus] Thanks for your\n      pains.\n    [Aside to Banquo] Do you not hope your children shall be\nkings,\n    When those that gave the Thane of Cawdor to me\n    Promised no less to them?\n  BANQUO. [Aside to Macbeth.] That, trusted home,\n    Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,\n    Besides the Thane of Cawdor. But \'tis strange; \n    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,\n    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,\n    Win us with honest trifles, to betray\'s\n    In deepest consequence-\n    Cousins, a word, I pray you.\n  MACBETH. [Aside.] Two truths are told,\n    As happy prologues to the swelling act\n    Of the imperial theme-I thank you, gentlemen.\n    [Aside.] This supernatural soliciting\n    Cannot be ill, cannot be good. If ill,\n    Why hath it given me earnest of success,\n    Commencing in a truth? I am Thane of Cawdor.\n    If good, why do I yield to that suggestion\n    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair\n    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,\n    Against the use of nature? Present fears\n    Are less than horrible imaginings:\n    My thought, whose murther yet is but fantastical,\n    Shakes so my single state of man that function\n    Is smother\'d in surmise, and nothing is \n    But what is not.\n  BANQUO. Look, how our partner\'s rapt.\n  MACBETH. [Aside.] If chance will have me King, why, chance may\n      crown me\n    Without my stir.\n  BANQUO. New honors come upon him,\n    Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould\n    But with the aid of use.\n  MACBETH. [Aside.] Come what come may,\n    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.\n  BANQUO. Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.\n  MACBETH. Give me your favor; my dull brain was wrought\n    With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains\n    Are register\'d where every day I turn\n    The leaf to read them. Let us toward the King.\n    Think upon what hath chanced, and at more time,\n    The interim having weigh\'d it, let us speak\n    Our free hearts each to other.\n  BANQUO. Very gladly.\n  MACBETH. Till then, enough. Come, friends.             Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nForres. The palace.\n\nFlourish. Enter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Lennox, and\nAttendants.\n\n  DUNCAN. Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not\n    Those in commission yet return\'d?\n  MALCOLM. My liege,\n    They are not yet come back. But I have spoke\n    With one that saw him die, who did report\n    That very frankly he confess\'d his treasons,\n    Implored your Highness\' pardon, and set forth\n    A deep repentance. Nothing in his life\n    Became him like the leaving it; he died\n    As one that had been studied in his death,\n    To throw away the dearest thing he owed\n    As \'twere a careless trifle.\n  DUNCAN. There\'s no art\n    To find the mind\'s construction in the face:\n    He was a gentleman on whom I built\n    An absolute trust. \n\n             Enter Macbeth, Banquo, Ross, and Angus.\n\n    O worthiest cousin!\n    The sin of my ingratitude even now\n    Was heavy on me. Thou art so far before,\n    That swiftest wing of recompense is slow\n    To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,\n    That the proportion both of thanks and payment\n    Might have been mine! Only I have left to say,\n    More is thy due than more than all can pay.\n  MACBETH. The service and the loyalty lowe,\n    In doing it, pays itself. Your Highness\' part\n    Is to receive our duties, and our duties\n    Are to your throne and state, children and servants,\n    Which do but what they should, by doing everything\n    Safe toward your love and honor.\n  DUNCAN. Welcome hither.\n    I have begun to plant thee, and will labor\n    To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo, \n    That hast no less deserved, nor must be known\n    No less to have done so; let me infold thee\n    And hold thee to my heart.\n  BANQUO. There if I grow,\n    The harvest is your own.\n  DUNCAN. My plenteous joys,\n    Wanton in fullness, seek to hide themselves\n    In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,\n    And you whose places are the nearest, know\n    We will establish our estate upon\n    Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter\n    The Prince of Cumberland; which honor must\n    Not unaccompanied invest him only,\n    But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine\n    On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,\n    And bind us further to you.\n  MACBETH. The rest is labor, which is not used for you.\n    I\'ll be myself the harbinger, and make joyful\n    The hearing of my wife with your approach;\n    So humbly take my leave. \n  DUNCAN. My worthy Cawdor!\n  MACBETH. [Aside.] The Prince of Cumberland! That is a step\n    On which I must fall down, or else o\'erleap,\n    For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;\n    Let not light see my black and deep desires.\n    The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be\n    Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.          Exit.\n  DUNCAN. True, worthy Banquo! He is full so valiant,\n    And in his commendations I am fed;\n    It is a banquet to me. Let\'s after him,\n    Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome.\n    It is a peerless kinsman.                  Flourish. Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\nInverness. Macbeth\'s castle.\n\nEnter Lady Macbeth, reading a letter.\n\n  LADY MACBETH. "They met me in the day of success, and I have\n    learned by the perfectest report they have more in them than\n    mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire to question them\n    further, they made themselves air, into which they vanished.\n    Whiles I stood rapt in the wonder of it, came missives from\nthe\n    King, who all-hailed me \'Thane of Cawdor\'; by which title,\n    before, these weird sisters saluted me and referred me to the\n    coming on of time with \'Hail, King that shalt be!\' This have\nI\n    thought good to deliver thee, my dearest partner of\ngreatness,\n    that thou mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being\n    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it to thy\nheart,\n    and farewell."\n\n    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor, and shalt be\n    What thou art promised. Yet do I fear thy nature.\n    It is too full o\' the milk of human kindness\n    To catch the nearest way. Thou wouldst be great; \n    Art not without ambition, but without\n    The illness should attend it. What thou wouldst highly,\n    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,\n    And yet wouldst wrongly win. Thou\'ldst have, great Glamis,\n    That which cries, "Thus thou must do, if thou have it;\n    And that which rather thou dost fear to do\n    Than wishest should be undone." Hie thee hither,\n    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear,\n    And chastise with the valor of my tongue\n    All that impedes thee from the golden round,\n    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem\n    To have thee crown\'d withal.\n\n                     Enter a Messenger.\n\n    What is your tidings?\n  MESSENGER. The King comes here tonight.\n  LADY MACBETH. Thou\'rt mad to say it!\n    Is not thy master with him? who, were\'t so,\n    Would have inform\'d for preparation. \n  MESSENGER. So please you, it is true; our Thane is coming.\n    One of my fellows had the speed of him,\n    Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more\n    Than would make up his message.\n  LADY MACBETH. Give him tending;\n    He brings great news.                        Exit Messenger.\n    The raven himself is hoarse\n    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan\n    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits\n    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here\n    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full\n    Of direst cruelty! Make thick my blood,\n    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,\n    That no compunctious visitings of nature\n    Shake my fell purpose nor keep peace between\n    The effect and it! Come to my woman\'s breasts,\n    And take my milk for gall, your murthering ministers,\n    Wherever in your sightless substances\n    You wait on nature\'s mischief! Come, thick night,\n    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell \n    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes\n    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark\n    To cry, "Hold, hold!"\n\n                    Enter Macbeth.\n\n    Great Glamis! Worthy Cawdor!\n    Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!\n    Thy letters have transported me beyond\n    This ignorant present, and I feel now\n    The future in the instant.\n  MACBETH. My dearest love,\n    Duncan comes here tonight.\n  LADY MACBETH. And when goes hence?\n  MACBETH. Tomorrow, as he purposes.\n  LADY MACBETH. O, never\n    Shall sun that morrow see!\n    Your face, my Thane, is as a book where men\n    May read strange matters. To beguile the time,\n    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye, \n    Your hand, your tongue; look like the innocent flower,\n    But be the serpent under it. He that\'s coming\n    Must be provided for; and you shall put\n    This night\'s great business into my dispatch,\n    Which shall to all our nights and days to come\n    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.\n  MACBETH. We will speak further.\n  LADY MACBETH. Only look up clear;\n    To alter favor ever is to fear.\n    Leave all the rest to me.                            Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\nBefore Macbeth\'s castle.  Hautboys and torches.\n\nEnter Duncan, Malcolm, Donalbain, Banquo, Lennox, Macduff, Ross,\nAngus,\nand Attendants.\n\n  DUNCAN. This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air\n    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself\n    Unto our gentle senses.\n  BANQUO. This guest of summer,\n    The temple-haunting martlet, does approve\n    By his loved mansionry that the heaven\'s breath\n    Smells wooingly here. No jutty, frieze,\n    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird\n    Hath made his pendant bed and procreant cradle;\n    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed\n    The air is delicate.\n\n                     Enter Lady Macbeth.\n\n  DUNCAN. See, see, our honor\'d hostess!\n    The love that follows us sometime is our trouble, \n    Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you\n    How you shall bid God \'ield us for your pains,\n    And thank us for your trouble.\n  LADY MACBETH. All our service\n    In every point twice done, and then done double,\n    Were poor and single business to contend\n    Against those honors deep and broad wherewith\n    Your Majesty loads our house. For those of old,\n    And the late dignities heap\'d up to them,\n    We rest your hermits.\n  DUNCAN. Where\'s the Thane of Cawdor?\n    We coursed him at the heels and had a purpose\n    To be his purveyor; but he rides well,\n    And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him\n    To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,\n    We are your guest tonight.\n  LADY MACBETH. Your servants ever\n    Have theirs, themselves, and what is theirs, in compt,\n    To make their audit at your Highness\' pleasure,\n    Still to return your own. \n  DUNCAN. Give me your hand;\n    Conduct me to mine host. We love him highly,\n    And shall continue our graces towards him.\n    By your leave, hostess.                              Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VII\nMacbeth\'s castle.  Hautboys and torches.\n\nEnter a Sewer and divers Servants with dishes and service, who\npass over\nthe stage.  Then enter Macbeth.\n\n  MACBETH. If it were done when \'tis done, then \'twere well\n    It were done quickly. If the assassination\n    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch,\n    With his surcease, success; that but this blow\n    Might be the be-all and the end-all -here,\n    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,\n    We\'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases\n    We still have judgement here, that we but teach\n    Bloody instructions, which being taught return\n    To plague the inventor. This even-handed justice\n    Commends the ingredients of our poison\'d chalice\n    To our own lips. He\'s here in double trust:\n    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,\n    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,\n    Who should against his murtherer shut the door, \n    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan\n    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been\n    So clear in his great office, that his virtues\n    Will plead like angels trumpet-tongued against\n    The deep damnation of his taking-off,\n    And pity, like a naked new-born babe\n    Striding the blast, or heaven\'s cherubin horsed\n    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,\n    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,\n    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur\n    To prick the sides of my intent, but only\n    Vaulting ambition, which o\'erleaps itself\n    And falls on the other.\n\n                 Enter Lady Macbeth.\n\n    How now, what news?\n  LADY MACBETH. He has almost supp\'d. Why have you left the\nchamber?\n  MACBETH. Hath he ask\'d for me?\n  LADY MACBETH. Know you not he has? \n  MACBETH. We will proceed no further in this business:\n    He hath honor\'d me of late, and I have bought\n    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,\n    Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,\n    Not cast aside so soon.\n  LADY MACBETH. Was the hope drunk\n    Wherein you dress\'d yourself? Hath it slept since?\n    And wakes it now, to look so green and pale\n    At what it did so freely? From this time\n    Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard\n    To be the same in thine own act and valor\n    As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that\n    Which thou esteem\'st the ornament of life\n    And live a coward in thine own esteem,\n    Letting "I dare not" wait upon "I would"\n    Like the poor cat i\' the adage?\n  MACBETH. Prithee, peace!\n    I dare do all that may become a man;\n    Who dares do more is none.\n  LADY MACBETH. What beast wast then \n    That made you break this enterprise to me?\n    When you durst do it, then you were a man,\n    And, to be more than what you were, you would\n    Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place\n    Did then adhere, and yet you would make both.\n    They have made themselves, and that their fitness now\n    Does unmake you. I have given suck and know\n    How tender \'tis to love the babe that milks me-\n    I would, while it was smiling in my face,\n    Have pluck\'d my nipple from his boneless gums\n    And dash\'d the brains out had I so sworn as you\n    Have done to this.\n  MACBETH. If we should fail?\n  LADY MACBETH. We fail?\n    But screw your courage to the sticking-place\n    And we\'ll not fail. When Duncan is asleep-\n    Whereto the rather shall his day\'s hard journey\n    Soundly invite him- his two chamberlains\n    Will I with wine and wassail so convince\n    That memory, the warder of the brain, \n    Shall be a fume and the receipt of reason\n    A limbeck only. When in swinish sleep\n    Their drenched natures lie as in a death,\n    What cannot you and I perform upon\n    The unguarded Duncan? What not put upon\n    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt\n    Of our great quell?\n  MACBETH.

Court of Macbeth\'s castle.\n\nEnter Banquo and Fleance, bearing a torch before him.\n\n  BANQUO. How goes the night, boy?\n  FLEANCE. The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.\n  BANQUO. And she goes down at twelve.\n  FLEANCE. I take\'t \'tis later, sir.\n  BANQUO. Hold, take my sword. There\'s husbandry in heaven,\n    Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.\n    A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,\n    And yet I would not sleep. Merciful powers,\n    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature\n    Gives way to in repose!\n\n           Enter Macbeth and a Servant with a torch.\n\n    Give me my sword.\n    Who\'s there?\n  MACBETH. A friend.\n  BANQUO. What, sir, not yet at rest? The King\'s abed. \n    He hath been in unusual pleasure and\n    Sent forth great largess to your offices.\n    This diamond he greets your wife withal,\n    By the name of most kind hostess, and shut up\n    In measureless content.\n  MACBETH. Being unprepared,\n    Our will became the servant to defect,\n    Which else should free have wrought.\n  BANQUO. All\'s well.\n    I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:\n    To you they have show\'d some truth.\n  MACBETH. I think not of them;\n    Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,\n    We would spend it in some words upon that business,\n    If you would grant the time.\n  BANQUO. At your kind\'st leisure.\n  MACBETH. If you shall cleave to my consent, when \'tis,\n    It shall make honor for you.\n  BANQUO. So I lose none\n    In seeking to augment it, but still keep \n    My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,\n    I shall be counsel\'d.\n  MACBETH. Good repose the while.\n  BANQUO. Thanks, sir, the like to you.\n                                     Exeunt Banquo. and Fleance.\n  MACBETH. Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,\n    She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.     Exit Servant.\n    Is this a dagger which I see before me,\n    The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.\n    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.\n    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible\n    To feeling as to sight? Or art thou but\n    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,\n    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?\n    I see thee yet, in form as palpable\n    As this which now I draw.\n    Thou marshal\'st me the way that I was going,\n    And such an instrument I was to use.\n    Mine eyes are made the fools o\' the other senses,\n    Or else worth all the rest. I see thee still, \n    And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,\n    Which was not so before. There\'s no such thing:\n    It is the bloody business which informs\n    Thus to mine eyes. Now o\'er the one half-world\n    Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse\n    The curtain\'d sleep; witchcraft celebrates\n    Pale Hecate\'s offerings; and wither\'d Murther,\n    Alarum\'d by his sentinel, the wolf,\n    Whose howl\'s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,\n    With Tarquin\'s ravishing strides, towards his design\n    Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,\n    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear\n    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,\n    And take the present horror from the time,\n    Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives;\n    Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.\n                                                   A bell rings.\n    I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.\n    Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell\n    That summons thee to heaven, or to hell.               Exit.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nThe same.\n\nEnter Lady Macbeth.\n\n  LADY MACBETH. That which hath made them drunk hath made me\nbold;\n    What hath quench\'d them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace!\n    It was the owl that shriek\'d, the fatal bellman,\n    Which gives the stern\'st good night. He is about it:\n    The doors are open, and the surfeited grooms\n    Do mock their charge with snores. I have drugg\'d their\npossets\n    That death and nature do contend about them,\n    Whether they live or die.\n  MACBETH. [Within.] Who\'s there\' what, ho!\n  LADY MACBETH. Alack, I am afraid they have awaked\n    And \'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed\n    Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;\n    He could not miss \'em. Had he not resembled\n    My father as he slept, I had done\'t.\n\n                      Enter Macbeth,\n \n    My husband!\n  MACBETH. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?\n  LADY MACBETH. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.\n    Did not you speak?\n  MACBETH. When?\n  LADY MACBETH. Now.\n  MACBETH. As I descended?\n  LADY MACBETH. Ay.\n  MACBETH. Hark!\n    Who lies i\' the second chamber?\n  LADY MACBETH. Donalbain.\n  MACBETH. This is a sorry sight.           [Looks on his hands.\n  LADY MACBETH. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.\n  MACBETH. There\'s one did laugh in \'s sleep, and one cried,\n      "Murther!"\n    That they did wake each other. I stood and heard them,\n    But they did say their prayers and address\'d them\n    Again to sleep.\n  LADY MACBETH. There are two lodged together.\n  MACBETH. One cried, "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other, \n    As they had seen me with these hangman\'s hands.\n    Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen,"\n    When they did say, "God bless us!"\n  LADY MACBETH. Consider it not so deeply.\n  MACBETH. But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen"?\n    I had most need of blessing, and "Amen"\n    Stuck in my throat.\n  LADY MACBETH. These deeds must not be thought\n    After these ways; so, it will make us mad.\n  MACBETH. I heard a voice cry, "Sleep no more!\n    Macbeth does murther sleep" -the innocent sleep,\n    Sleep that knits up the ravel\'d sleave of care,\n    The death of each day\'s life, sore labor\'s bath,\n    Balm of hurt minds, great nature\'s second course,\n    Chief nourisher in life\'s feast-\n  LADY MACBETH. What do you mean?\n  MACBETH. Still it cried, "Sleep no more!" to all the house;\n    "Glamis hath murther\'d sleep, and therefore Cawdor\n    Shall sleep no more. Macbeth shall sleep no more."\n  LADY MACBETH. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy Thane, \n    You do unbend your noble strength, to think\n    So brainsickly of things. Go, get some water\n    And wash this filthy witness from your hand.\n    Why did you bring these daggers from the place?\n    They must lie there. Go carry them, and smear\n    The sleepy grooms with blood.\n  MACBETH. I\'ll go no more.\n    I am afraid to think what I have done;\n    Look on\'t again I dare not.\n  LADY MACBETH. Infirm of purpose!\n    Give me the daggers. The sleeping and the dead\n    Are but as pictures; \'tis the eye of childhood\n    That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,\n    I\'ll gild the faces of the grooms withal,\n    For it must seem their guilt.         Exit. Knocking within.\n  MACBETH. Whence is that knocking?\n    How is\'t with me, when every noise appals me?\n    What hands are here? Ha, they pluck out mine eyes!\n    Will all great Neptune\'s ocean wash this blood\n    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather \n    The multitudinous seas incarnadine,\n    Making the green one red.\n\n                   Re-enter Lady Macbeth.\n\n  LADY MACBETH. My hands are of your color, but I shame\n    To wear a heart so white. [Knocking within.] I hear knocking\n    At the south entry. Retire we to our chamber.\n    A little water clears us of this deed.\n    How easy is it then! Your constancy\n    Hath left you unattended. [Knocking within.] Hark, more\nknocking.\n    Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us\n    And show us to be watchers. Be not lost\n    So poorly in your thoughts.\n  MACBETH. To know my deed, \'twere best not know myself.\n                                                Knocking within.\n    Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nThe same.\n\nEnter a Porter. Knocking within.\n\n  PORTER. Here\'s a knocking indeed! If a man were porter of Hell\n    Gate, he should have old turning the key. [Knocking within.]\n    Knock, knock, knock! Who\'s there, i\' the name of Belzebub?\nHere\'s\n    a farmer that hanged himself on th\' expectation of plenty.\nCome\n    in time! Have napkins enow about you; here you\'ll sweat fort.\n    [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Who\'s there, in th\' other\n    devil\'s name? Faith, here\'s an equivocator that could swear\nin\n    both the scales against either scale, who committed treason\n    enough for God\'s sake, yet could not equivocate to heaven. O,\n    come in, equivocator. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock, knock!\n    Who\'s there? Faith, here\'s an English tailor come hither, for\n    stealing out of a French hose. Come in, tailor; here you may\n    roast your goose. [Knocking within.] Knock, knock! Never at\n    quiet! What are you? But this place is too cold for hell.\nI\'ll\n    devil-porter it no further. I had thought to have let in some\nof\n    all professions, that go the primrose way to the everlasting\n    bonfire. [Knocking within.] Anon, anon! I pray you, remember\nthe \n    porter.\n                                                 Opens the gate.\n\n                       Enter Macduff and Lennox.\n\n  MACDUFF. Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,\n    That you do lie so late?\n  PORTER. Faith, sir, we were carousing till the second cock; and\n    drink, sir, is a great provoker of three things.\n  MACDUFF. What three things does drink especially provoke?\n  PORTER. Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and urine. Lechery,\nsir,\n    it provokes and unprovokes: it provokes the desire, but it\ntakes\n    away the performance. Therefore much drink may be said to be\nan\n    equivocator with lechery: it makes him, and it mars him; it\nsets\n    him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him and\ndisheartens\n    him; makes him stand to and not stand to; in conclusion,\n    equivocates him in a sleep, and giving him the lie, leaves\nhim.\n  MACDUFF. I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.\n  PORTER. That it did, sir, i\' the very throat on me; but\nrequited\n    him for his lie, and, I think, being too strong for him,\nthough \n    he took up my legs sometime, yet I made shift to cast him.\n  MACDUFF. Is thy master stirring?\n\n                             Enter Macbeth.\n\n    Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.\n  LENNOX. Good morrow, noble sir.\n  MACBETH. morrow, both.\n  MACDUFF. Is the King stirring, worthy Thane?\n  MACBETH. Not yet.\n  MACDUFF. He did command me to call timely on him;\n    I have almost slipp\'d the hour.\n  MACBETH. I\'ll bring you to him.\n  MACDUFF. I know this is a joyful trouble to you,\n    But yet \'tis one.\n  MACBETH. The labor we delight in physics pain.\n    This is the door.\n  MACDUFF I\'ll make so bold to call,\n    For \'tis my limited service.                           Exit.\n  LENNOX. Goes the King hence today? \n  MACBETH. He does; he did appoint so.\n  LENNOX. The night has been unruly. Where we lay,\n    Our chimneys were blown down, and, as they say,\n    Lamentings heard i\' the air, strange screams of death,\n    And prophesying with accents terrible\n    Of dire combustion and confused events\n    New hatch\'d to the woeful time. The obscure bird\n    Clamor\'d the livelong night. Some say the earth\n    Was feverous and did shake.\n  MACBETH. \'Twas a rough fight.\n  LENNOX. My young remembrance cannot parallel\n    A fellow to it.\n\n                      Re-enter Macduff.\n\n  MACDUFF. O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart\n    Cannot conceive nor name thee.\n  MACBETH. LENNOX. What\'s the matter?\n  MACDUFF. Confusion now hath made his masterpiece.\n    Most sacrilegious murther hath broke ope \n    The Lord\'s anointed temple and stole thence\n    The life o\' the building.\n  MACBETH. What is\'t you say? the life?\n  LENNOX. Mean you his Majesty?\n  MACDUFF. Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight\n    With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak;\n    See, and then speak yourselves.\n                                      Exeunt Macbeth and Lennox.\n    Awake, awake!\n    Ring the alarum bell. Murther and treason!\n    Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm, awake!\n    Shake off this downy sleep, death\'s counterfeit,\n    And look on death itself! Up, up, and see\n    The great doom\'s image! Malcolm! Banquo!\n    As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites\n    To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.       Bell rings.\n\n                     Enter Lady Macbeth.\n\n  LADY MACBETH. What\'s the business, \n    That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley\n    The sleepers of the house? Speak, speak!\n  MACDUFF. O gentle lady,\n    \'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:\n    The repetition in a woman\'s ear\n    Would murther as it fell.\n\n                     Enter Banquo.\n\n    O Banquo, Banquo!\n    Our royal master\'s murther\'d.\n  LADY MACBETH. Woe, alas!\n    What, in our house?\n  BANQUO. Too cruel anywhere.\n    Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,\n    And say it is not so.\n\n          Re-enter Macbeth and Lennox, with Ross.\n\n  MACBETH. Had I but died an hour before this chance, \n    I had lived a blessed time, for from this instant\n    There\'s nothing serious in mortality.\n    All is but toys; renown and grace is dead,\n    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees\n    Is left this vault to brag of.\n\n                Enter Malcolm and Donalbain.\n\n  DONALBAIN. What is amiss?\n  MACBETH. You are, and do not know\'t.\n    The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood\n    Is stopped, the very source of it is stopp\'d.\n  MACDUFF. Your royal father\'s murther\'d.\n   MALCOLM. O, by whom?\n  LENNOX. Those of his chamber, as it seem\'d, had done\'t.\n    Their hands and faces were all badged with blood;\n    So were their daggers, which unwiped we found\n    Upon their pillows.\n    They stared, and were distracted; no man\'s life\n    Was to be trusted with them. \n  MACBETH. O, yet I do repent me of my fury,\n    That I did kill them.\n  MACDUFF. Wherefore did you so?\n  MACBETH. Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,\n    Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man.\n    The expedition of my violent love\n    Outrun the pauser reason. Here lay Duncan,\n    His silver skin laced with his golden blood,\n    And his gash\'d stabs look\'d like a breach in nature\n    For ruin\'s wasteful entrance; there, the murtherers,\n    Steep\'d in the colors of their trade, their daggers\n    Unmannerly breech\'d with gore. Who could refrain,\n    That had a heart to love, and in that heart\n    Courage to make \'s love known?\n  LADY MACBETH. Help me hence, ho!\n  MACDUFF. Look to the lady.\n  MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Why do we hold our tongues,\n    That most may claim this argument for ours?\n  DONALBAIN. [Aside to Malcolm.] What should be spoken here,\nwhere\n      our fate, \n    Hid in an auger hole, may rush and seize us?\n    Let\'s away,\n    Our tears are not yet brew\'d.\n  MALCOLM. [Aside to Donalbain.] Nor our strong sorrow\n    Upon the foot of motion.\n  BANQUO. Look to the lady.\n                                    Lady Macbeth is carried out.\n    And when we have our naked frailties hid,\n    That suffer in exposure, let us meet\n    And question this most bloody piece of work\n    To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us.\n    In the great hand of God I stand, and thence\n    Against the undivulged pretense I fight\n    Of treasonous malice.\n  MACDUFF. And so do I.\n  ALL. So all.\n  MACBETH. Let\'s briefly put on manly readiness\n    And meet i\' the hall together.\n  ALL. Well contented.\n                           Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain. \n  MALCOLM. What will you do? Let\'s not consort with them.\n    To show an unfelt sorrow is an office\n    Which the false man does easy. I\'ll to England.\n  DONALBAIN. To Ireland, I; our separated fortune\n    Shall keep us both the safer. Where we are\n    There\'s daggers in men\'s smiles; the near in blood,\n    The nearer bloody.\n  MALCOLM. This murtherous shaft that\'s shot\n    Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way\n    Is to avoid the aim. Therefore to horse;\n    And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,\n    But shift away. There\'s warrant in that theft\n    Which steals itself when there\'s no mercy left.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nOutside Macbeth\'s castle.\n\nEnter Ross with an Old Man.\n\n  OLD MAN. Threescore and ten I can remember well,\n    Within the volume of which time I have seen\n    Hours dreadful and things strange, but this sore night\n    Hath trifled former knowings.\n  ROSS. Ah, good father,\n    Thou seest the heavens, as troubled with man\'s act,\n    Threaten his bloody stage. By the clock \'tis day,\n    And yet dark night strangles the traveling lamp.\n    Is\'t night\'s predominance, or the day\'s shame,\n    That darkness does the face of earth entomb,\n    When living light should kiss it?\n  OLD MAN. \'Tis unnatural,\n    Even like the deed that\'s done. On Tuesday last\n    A falcon towering in her pride of place\n    Was by a mousing owl hawk\'d at and kill\'d.\n  ROSS. And Duncan\'s horses-a thing most strange and certain-\n    Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race, \n    Turn\'d wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,\n    Contending \'gainst obedience, as they would make\n    War with mankind.\n  OLD MAN. \'Tis said they eat each other.\n  ROSS. They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes\n    That look\'d upon\'t.\n\n                     Enter Macduff.\n\n    Here comes the good Macduff.\n    How goes the world, sir, now?\n  MACDUFF. Why, see you not?\n  ROSS. Is\'t known who did this more than bloody deed?\n  MACDUFF. Those that Macbeth hath slain.\n  ROSS. Alas, the day!\n    What good could they pretend?\n  MACDUFF. They were suborn\'d:\n    Malcolm and Donalbain, the King\'s two sons,\n    Are stol\'n away and fled, which puts upon them\n    Suspicion of the deed. \n  ROSS. \'Gainst nature still!\n    Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up\n    Thine own life\'s means! Then \'tis most like\n    The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.\n  MACDUFF. He is already named, and gone to Scone\n    To be invested.\n  ROSS. Where is Duncan\'s body?\n  MACDUFF. Carried to Colmekill,\n    The sacred storehouse of his predecessors\n    And guardian of their bones.\n  ROSS. Will you to Scone?\n  MACDUFF. No, cousin, I\'ll to Fife.\n  ROSS. Well, I will thither.\n  MACDUFF. Well, may you see things well done there.\n    Adieu,\n    Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!\n  ROSS. Farewell, father.\n  OLD MAN. God\'s benison go with you and with those\n    That would make good of bad and friends of foes!\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Thou hast it now: King, Cawdor, Glamis, all,\n    As the weird women promised, and I fear\n    Thou play\'dst most foully for\'t; yet it was said\n    It should not stand in thy posterity,\n    But that myself should be the root and father\n    Of many kings. If there come truth from them\n    (As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine)\n    Why, by the verities on thee made good,\n    May they not be my oracles as well\n    And set me up in hope? But hush, no more.\n\n      Sennet sounds. Enter Macbeth as King, Lady Macbeth\n    as Queen, Lennox, Ross, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants.\n\n  MACBETH. Here\'s our chief guest.\n  LADY MACBETH. If he had been forgotten,\n    It had been as a gap in our great feast \n    And all thing unbecoming.\n  MACBETH.

Let your Highness\n    Command upon me, to the which my duties\n    Are with a most indissoluble tie\n    Forever knit.\n  MACBETH. Ride you this afternoon?\n  BANQUO. Ay, my good lord.\n  MACBETH. We should have else desired your good advice,\n    Which still hath been both grave and prosperous\n    In this day\'s council; but we\'ll take tomorrow.\n    Is\'t far you ride\'!\n  BANQUO. As far, my lord, as will fill up the time\n    \'Twixt this and supper. Go not my horse the better,\n    I must become a borrower of the night\n    For a dark hour or twain.\n  MACBETH. Fail not our feast.\n  BANQUO. My lord, I will not.\n  MACBETH. We hear our bloody cousins are bestow\'d \n    In England and in Ireland, not confessing\n    Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers\n    With strange invention. But of that tomorrow,\n    When therewithal we shall have cause of state\n    Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse; adieu,\n    Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?\n  BANQUO.

Our fears in Banquo.\n    Stick deep, and in his royalty of nature\n    Reigns that which would be fear\'d. \'Tis much he dares,\n    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,\n    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valor\n    To act in safety. There is none but he\n    Whose being I do fear; and under him\n    My genius is rebuked, as it is said\n    Mark Antony\'s was by Caesar. He chid the sisters\n    When first they put the name of King upon me\n    And bade them speak to him; then prophet-like\n    They hail\'d him father to a line of kings.\n    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown\n    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,\n    Thence to be wrench\'d with an unlineal hand,\n    No son of mine succeeding. If\'t be so,\n    For Banquo\'s issue have I filed my mind,\n    For them the gracious Duncan have I murther\'d,\n    Put rancors in the vessel of my peace\n    Only for them, and mine eternal jewel \n    Given to the common enemy of man,\n    To make them kings -the seed of Banquo kings!\n    Rather than so, come, Fate, into the list,\n    And champion me to the utterance! Who\'s there?\n\n        Re-enter Attendant, with two Murtherers.\n\n    Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.\n                                                 Exit Attendant.\n    Was it not yesterday we spoke together?\n  FIRST MURTHERER. It was, so please your Highness.\n  MACBETH. Well then, now\n    Have you consider\'d of my speeches? Know\n    That it was he in the times past which held you\n    So under fortune, which you thought had been\n    Our innocent self? This I made good to you\n    In our last conference, pass\'d in probation with you:\n    How you were borne in hand, how cross\'d, the instruments,\n    Who wrought with them, and all things else that might\n    To half a soul and to a notion crazed \n    Say, "Thus did Banquo."\n  FIRST MURTHERER. You made it known to us.\n  MACBETH. I did so, and went further, which is now\n    Our point of second meeting. Do you find\n    Your patience so predominant in your nature,\n    That you can let this go? Are you so gospel\'d,\n    To pray for this good man and for his issue,\n    Whose heavy hand hath bow\'d you to the grave\n    And beggar\'d yours forever?\n  FIRST MURTHERER. We are men, my liege.\n  MACBETH. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men,\n    As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,\n    Shoughs, waterrugs, and demi-wolves are clept\n    All by the name of dogs. The valued file\n    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,\n    The housekeeper, the hunter, every one\n    According to the gift which bounteous nature\n    Hath in him closed, whereby he does receive\n    Particular addition, from the bill\n    That writes them all alike; and so of men. \n    Now if you have a station in the file,\n    Not i\' the worst rank of manhood, say it,\n    And I will put that business in your bosoms\n    Whose execution takes your enemy off,\n    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,\n    Who wear our health but sickly in his life,\n    Which in his death were perfect.\n  SECOND MURTHERER. I am one, my liege,\n    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world\n    Have so incensed that I am reckless what\n    I do to spite the world.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. And I another\n    So weary with disasters, tugg\'d with fortune,\n    That I would set my life on any chance,\n    To mend it or be rid on\'t.\n  MACBETH. Both of you\n    Know Banquo was your enemy.\n  BOTH MURTHERERS. True, my lord.\n  MACBETH. So is he mine, and in such bloody distance\n    That every minute of his being thrusts \n    Against my near\'st of life; and though I could\n    With barefaced power sweep him from my sight\n    And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,\n    For certain friends that are both his and mine,\n    Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall\n    Who I myself struck down. And thence it is\n    That I to your assistance do make love,\n    Masking the business from the common eye\n    For sundry weighty reasons.\n  SECOND MURTHERER. We shall, my lord,\n    Perform what you command us.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. Though our lives-\n  MACBETH. Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at\nmost\n    I will advise you where to plant yourselves,\n    Acquaint you with the perfect spy o\' the time,\n    The moment on\'t; fort must be done tonight\n    And something from the palace (always thought\n    That I require a clearness); and with him-\n    To leave no rubs nor botches in the work-\n    Fleance his son, that keeps him company, \n    Whose absence is no less material to me\n    Than is his father\'s, must embrace the fate\n    Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart;\n    I\'ll come to you anon.\n  BOTH MURTHERERS. We are resolved, my lord.\n  MACBETH. I\'ll call upon you straight. Abide within.\n                                              Exeunt Murtherers.\n    It is concluded: Banquo, thy soul\'s flight,\n    If it find heaven, must find it out tonight.           Exit.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nThe palace.\n\nEnter Lady Macbeth and a Servant.\n\n  LADY MACBETH. Is Banquo gone from court?\n  SERVANT. Ay, madam, but returns again tonight.\n  LADY MACBETH. Say to the King I would attend his leisure\n    For a few words.\n  SERVANT. Madam, I will.                                  Exit.\n  LADY MACBETH. Nought\'s had, all\'s spent,\n    Where our desire is got without content.\n    \'Tis safer to be that which we destroy\n    Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.\n\n                    Enter Macbeth.\n\n    How now, my lord? Why do you keep alone,\n    Of sorriest fancies your companions making,\n    Using those thoughts which should indeed have died\n    With them they think on? Things without all remedy\n    Should be without regard. What\'s done is done. \n  MACBETH. We have scotch\'d the snake, not kill\'d it.\n    She\'ll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice\n    Remains in danger of her former tooth.\n    But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds suffer,\n    Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep\n    In the affliction of these terrible dreams\n    That shake us nightly. Better be with the dead,\n    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,\n    Than on the torture of the mind to lie\n    In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;\n    After life\'s fitful fever he sleeps well.\n    Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,\n    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,\n    Can touch him further.\n  LADY MACBETH. Come on,\n    Gentle my lord, sleek o\'er your rugged looks;\n    Be bright and jovial among your guests tonight.\n  MACBETH. So shall I, love, and so, I pray, be you.\n    Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;\n    Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue: \n    Unsafe the while, that we\n    Must lave our honors in these flattering streams,\n    And make our faces vizards to our hearts,\n    Disguising what they are.\n  LADY MACBETH. You must leave this.\n  MACBETH. O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!\n    Thou know\'st that Banquo and his Fleance lives.\n  LADY MACBETH. But in them nature\'s copy\'s not eterne.\n  MACBETH. There\'s comfort yet; they are assailable.\n    Then be thou jocund. Ere the bat hath flown\n    His cloister\'d flight, ere to black Hecate\'s summons\n    The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums\n    Hath rung night\'s yawning peal, there shall be done\n    A deed of dreadful note.\n  LADY MACBETH. What\'s to be done?\n  MACBETH. Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,\n    Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,\n    Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day,\n    And with thy bloody and invisible hand\n    Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond \n    Which keeps me pale! Light thickens, and the crow\n    Makes wing to the rooky wood;\n    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse,\n    Whiles night\'s black agents to their preys do rouse.\n    Thou marvel\'st at my words, but hold thee still:\n    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.\n    So, prithee, go with me.                             Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nA park near the palace.\n\nEnter three Murtherers.\n\n  FIRST MURTHERER. But who did bid thee join with us?\n  THIRD MURTHERER. Macbeth.\n  SECOND MURTHERER. He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers\n    Our offices and what we have to do\n    To the direction just.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. Then stand with us.\n    The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day;\n    Now spurs the lated traveler apace\n    To gain the timely inn, and near approaches\n    The subject of our watch.\n  THIRD MURTHERER. Hark! I hear horses.\n  BANQUO. [Within.] Give us a light there, ho!\n  SECOND MURTHERER. Then \'tis he; the rest\n    That are within the note of expectation\n    Already are i\' the court.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. His horses go about.\n  THIRD MURTHERER. Almost a mile, but he does usually- \n    So all men do -from hence to the palace gate\n    Make it their walk.\n  SECOND MURTHERER. A light, a light!\n\n              Enter Banquo, and Fleance with a torch.\n\n  THIRD MURTHERER. \'Tis he.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. Stand to\'t.\n  BANQUO. It will be rain tonight.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. Let it come down.\n                                           They set upon Banquo.\n  BANQUO. O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!\n    Thou mayst revenge. O slave!          Dies. Fleance escapes.\n  THIRD MURTHERER. Who did strike out the light?\n  FIRST MURTHERER. Wast not the way?\n  THIRD MURTHERER. There\'s but one down; the son is fled.\n  SECOND MURTHERER. We have lost\n    Best half of our affair.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. Well, let\'s away and say how much is done.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nA Hall in the palace. A banquet prepared.\n\nEnter Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, Ross, Lennox, Lords, and Attendants.\n\n  MACBETH. You know your own degrees; sit down. At first\n    And last the hearty welcome.\n  LORDS. Thanks to your Majesty.\n  MACBETH. Ourself will mingle with society\n    And play the humble host.\n    Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time\n    We will require her welcome.\n  LADY MACBETH. Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends,\n    For my heart speaks they are welcome.\n\n                Enter first Murtherer to the door.\n\n  MACBETH. See, they encounter thee with their hearts\' thanks.\n    Both sides are even; here I\'ll sit i\' the midst.\n    Be large in mirth; anon we\'ll drink a measure\n    The table round. [Approaches the door.] There\'s blood upon\nthy \n      face.\n  MURTHERER. \'Tis Banquo\'s then.\n  MACBETH. \'Tis better thee without than he within.\n    Is he dispatch\'d?\n  MURTHERER. My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.\n  MACBETH. Thou art the best o\' the cut-throats! Yet he\'s good\n    That did the like for Fleance. If thou didst it,\n    Thou art the nonpareil.\n  MURTHERER. Most royal sir,\n    Fleance is \'scaped.\n  MACBETH. [Aside.] Then comes my fit again. I had else been\nperfect,\n    Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,\n    As broad and general as the casing air;\n    But now I am cabin\'d, cribb\'d, confin\'d, bound in\n    To saucy doubts and fears -But Banquo\'s safe?\n  MURTHERER. Ay, my good lord. Safe in a ditch he bides,\n    With twenty trenched gashes on his head,\n    The least a death to nature.\n  MACBETH. Thanks for that.\n    There the grown serpent lies; the worm that\'s fled \n    Hath nature that in time will venom breed,\n    No teeth for the present. Get thee gone. Tomorrow\n    We\'ll hear ourselves again.\n                                                 Exit Murtherer.\n  LADY MACBETH. My royal lord,\n    You do not give the cheer. The feast is sold\n    That is not often vouch\'d, while \'tis amaking,\n    \'Tis given with welcome. To feed were best at home;\n    From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;\n    Meeting were bare without it.\n  MACBETH. Sweet remembrancer!\n    Now good digestion wait on appetite,\n    And health on both!\n  LENNOX. May\'t please your Highness sit.\n\n      The Ghost of Banquo enters and sits in Macbeth\'s place.\n\n  MACBETH. Here had we now our country\'s honor roof\'d,\n    Were the graced person of our Banquo present,\n    Who may I rather challenge for unkindness \n    Than pity for mischance!\n  ROSS. His absence, sir,\n    Lays blame upon his promise. Please\'t your Highness\n    To grace us with your royal company?\n  MACBETH. The table\'s full.\n  LENNOX. Here is a place reserved, sir.\n  MACBETH. Where?\n  LENNOX. Here, my good lord. What is\'t that moves your Highness?\n  MACBETH. Which of you have done this?\n  LORDS. What, my good lord?\n  MACBETH. Thou canst not say I did it; never shake\n    Thy gory locks at me.\n  ROSS. Gentlemen, rise; his Highness is well.\n  LADY MACBETH. Sit, worthy friends; my lord is often thus,\n    And hath been from his youth. Pray you, keep seat.\n    The fit is momentary; upon a thought\n    He will again be well. If much you note him,\n    You shall offend him and extend his passion.\n    Feed, and regard him not-Are you a man?\n  MACBETH. Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that \n    Which might appal the devil.\n  LADY MACBETH. O proper stuff!\n    This is the very painting of your fear;\n    This is the air-drawn dagger which you said\n    Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,\n    Impostors to true fear, would well become\n    A woman\'s story at a winter\'s fire,\n    Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!\n    Why do you make such faces? When all\'s done,\n    You look but on a stool.\n  MACBETH. Prithee, see there! Behold! Look! Lo! How say you?\n    Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.\n    If charnel houses and our graves must send\n    Those that we bury back, our monuments\n    Shall be the maws of kites.                      Exit Ghost.\n  LADY MACBETH. What, quite unmann\'d in folly?\n  MACBETH. If I stand here, I saw him.\n  LADY MACBETH. Fie, for shame!\n  MACBETH. Blood hath been shed ere now, i\' the olden time,\n    Ere humane statute purged the gentle weal; \n    Ay, and since too, murthers have been perform\'d\n    Too terrible for the ear. The time has been,\n    That, when the brains were out, the man would die,\n    And there an end; but now they rise again,\n    With twenty mortal murthers on their crowns,\n    And push us from our stools. This is more strange\n    Than such a murther is.\n  LADY MACBETH. My worthy lord,\n    Your noble friends do lack you.\n  MACBETH. I do forget.\n    Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends.\n    I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing\n    To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;\n    Then I\'ll sit down. Give me some wine, fill full.\n    I drink to the general joy o\' the whole table,\n    And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss.\n    Would he were here! To all and him we thirst,\n    And all to all.\n  LORDS. Our duties and the pledge.\n \n                     Re-enter Ghost.\n\n  MACBETH. Avaunt, and quit my sight! Let the earth hide thee!\n    Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;\n    Thou hast no speculation in those eyes\n    Which thou dost glare with.\n  LADY MACBETH. Think of this, good peers,\n    But as a thing of custom. \'Tis no other,\n    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.\n  MACBETH. What man dare, I dare.\n    Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,\n    The arm\'d rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;\n    Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves\n    Shall never tremble. Or be alive again,\n    And dare me to the desert with thy sword.\n    If trembling I inhabit then, protest me\n    The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!\n    Unreal mockery, hence!                           Exit Ghost.\n    Why, so, being gone,\n    I am a man again. Pray you sit still. \n  LADY MACBETH. You have displaced the mirth, broke the good\nmeeting,\n    With most admired disorder.\n  MACBETH. Can such things be,\n    And overcome us like a summer\'s cloud,\n    Without our special wonder? You make me strange\n    Even to the disposition that I owe\n    When now I think you can behold such sights\n    And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks\n    When mine is blanch\'d with fear.\n  ROSS. What sights, my lord?\n  LADY MACBETH. I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;\n    Question enrages him. At once, good night.\n    Stand not upon the order of your going,\n    But go at once.\n  LENNOX. Good night, and better health\n    Attend his Majesty!\n  LADY MACBETH. A kind good night to all!\n                        Exeunt all but Macbeth and Lady Macbeth.\n  MACBETH. will have blood; they say blood will have blood.\n    Stones have been known to move and trees to speak; \n    Augures and understood relations have\n    By maggot pies and choughs and rooks brought forth\n    The secret\'st man of blood. What is the night?\n  LADY MACBETH. Almost at odds with morning, which is which.\n  MACBETH. How say\'st thou, that Macduff denies his person\n    At our great bidding?\n  LADY MACBETH. Did you send to him, sir?\n  MACBETH. I hear it by the way, but I will send.\n    There\'s not a one of them but in his house\n    I keep a servant feed. I will tomorrow,\n    And betimes I will, to the weird sisters.\n    More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,\n    By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good\n    All causes shall give way. I am in blood\n    Stepp\'d in so far that, should I wade no more,\n    Returning were as tedious as go o\'er.\n    Strange things I have in head that will to hand,\n    Which must be acted ere they may be scann\'d.\n  LADY MACBETH. You lack the season of all natures, sleep.\n  MACBETH. Come, we\'ll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse \n    Is the initiate fear that wants hard use.\n    We are yet but young in deed.                       Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\nA heath. Thunder.\n\nEnter the three Witches, meeting Hecate.\n\n  FIRST WITCH. Why, how now, Hecate? You look angerly.\n  HECATE. Have I not reason, beldams as you are,\n    Saucy and overbold? How did you dare\n    To trade and traffic with Macbeth\n    In riddles and affairs of death,\n    And I, the mistress of your charms,\n    The close contriver of all harms,\n    Was never call\'d to bear my part,\n    Or show the glory of our art?\n    And, which is worse, all you have done\n    Hath been but for a wayward son,\n    Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,\n    Loves for his own ends, not for you.\n    But make amends now. Get you gone,\n    And at the pit of Acheron\n    Meet me i\' the morning. Thither he\n    Will come to know his destiny. \n    Your vessels and your spells provide,\n    Your charms and everything beside.\n    I am for the air; this night I\'ll spend\n    Unto a dismal and a fatal end.\n    Great business must be wrought ere noon:\n    Upon the corner of the moon\n    There hangs a vaporous drop profound;\n    I\'ll catch it ere it come to ground.\n    And that distill\'d by magic sleights\n    Shall raise such artificial sprites\n    As by the strength of their illusion\n    Shall draw him on to his confusion.\n    He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear\n    His hopes \'bove wisdom, grace, and fear.\n    And you all know security\n    Is mortals\' chiefest enemy.\n                                        Music and a song within,\n                                         "Come away, come away."\n    Hark! I am call\'d; my little spirit, see,\n    Sits in a foggy cloud and stays for me.                Exit. \n  FIRST WITCH. Come, let\'s make haste; she\'ll soon be back again.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\nForres. The palace.\n\nEnter Lennox and another Lord.\n\n  LENNOX. My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,\n    Which can interpret farther; only I say\n    Thing\'s have been strangely borne. The gracious Duncan\n    Was pitied of Macbeth; marry, he was dead.\n    And the right valiant Banquo walk\'d too late,\n    Whom, you may say, if\'t please you, Fleance kill\'d,\n    For Fleance fled. Men must not walk too late.\n    Who cannot want the thought, how monstrous\n    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain\n    To kill their gracious father? Damned fact!\n    How it did grieve Macbeth! Did he not straight,\n    In pious rage, the two delinquents tear\n    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?\n    Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too,\n    For \'twould have anger\'d any heart alive\n    To hear the men deny\'t. So that, I say,\n    He has borne all things well; and I do think \n    That, had he Duncan\'s sons under his key-\n    As, an\'t please heaven, he shall not -they should find\n    What \'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.\n    But, peace! For from broad words, and \'cause he fail\'d\n    His presence at the tyrant\'s feast, I hear,\n    Macduff lives in disgrace. Sir, can you tell\n    Where he bestows himself?\n  LORD. The son of Duncan,\n    From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth,\n    Lives in the English court and is received\n    Of the most pious Edward with such grace\n    That the malevolence of fortune nothing\n    Takes from his high respect. Thither Macduff\n    Is gone to pray the holy King, upon his aid\n    To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward;\n    That by the help of these, with Him above\n    To ratify the work, we may again\n    Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,\n    Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,\n    Do faithful homage, and receive free honors- \n    All which we pine for now. And this report\n    Hath so exasperate the King that he\n    Prepares for some attempt of war.\n  LENNOX. Sent he to Macduff?\n  LORD. He did, and with an absolute "Sir, not I,"\n    The cloudy messenger turns me his back,\n    And hums, as who should say, "You\'ll rue the time\n    That clogs me with this answer."\n  LENNOX. And that well might\n    Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance\n    His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel\n    Fly to the court of England and unfold\n    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing\n    May soon return to this our suffering country\n    Under a hand accursed!\n  LORD. I\'ll send my prayers with him.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Fillet of a fenny snake,\n    In the cauldron boil and bake;\n    Eye of newt and toe of frog,\n    Wool of bat and tongue of dog,\n    Adder\'s fork and blind-worm\'s sting,\n    Lizard\'s leg and howlet\'s wing,\n    For a charm of powerful trouble, \n    Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.\n  ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble;\n    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.\n  THIRD WITCH. Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,\n    Witch\'s mummy, maw and gulf\n    Of the ravin\'d salt-sea shark,\n    Root of hemlock digg\'d i\' the dark,\n    Liver of blaspheming Jew,\n    Gall of goat and slips of yew\n    Sliver\'d in the moon\'s eclipse,\n    Nose of Turk and Tartar\'s lips,\n    Finger of birth-strangled babe\n    Ditch-deliver\'d by a drab,\n    Make the gruel thick and slab.\n    Add thereto a tiger\'s chawdron,\n    For the ingredients of our cawdron.\n  ALL. Double, double, toil and trouble;\n    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.\n  SECOND WITCH. Cool it with a baboon\'s blood,\n    Then the charm is firm and good. \n\n            Enter Hecate to the other three Witches.\n\n  HECATE. O, well done! I commend your pains,\n    And everyone shall share i\' the gains.\n    And now about the cauldron sing,\n    Like elves and fairies in a ring,\n    Enchanting all that you put in.\n                              Music and a song, "Black spirits."\n                                                 Hecate retires.\n  SECOND WITCH. By the pricking of my thumbs,\n    Something wicked this way comes.\n    Open, locks,\n    Whoever knocks!\n\n                      Enter Macbeth.\n\n  MACBETH. How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags?\n    What is\'t you do?\n  ALL. A deed without a name. \n  MACBETH. I conjure you, by that which you profess\n    (Howeer you come to know it) answer me:\n    Though you untie the winds and let them fight\n    Against the churches, though the yesty waves\n    Confound and swallow navigation up,\n    Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down,\n    Though castles topple on their warders\' heads,\n    Though palaces and pyramids do slope\n    Their heads to their foundations, though the treasure\n    Of nature\'s germaines tumble all together\n    Even till destruction sicken, answer me\n    To what I ask you.\n  FIRST WITCH. Speak.\n  SECOND WITCH. Demand.\n  THIRD WITCH. We\'ll answer.\n  FIRST WITCH. Say, if thou\'dst rather hear it from our mouths,\n    Or from our masters\'?\n  MACBETH. Call \'em, let me see \'em.\n  FIRST WITCH. Pour in sow\'s blood that hath eaten\n    Her nine farrow; grease that\'s sweaten \n    From the murtherer\'s gibbet throw\n    Into the flame.\n  ALL. Come, high or low;\n    Thyself and office deftly show!\n\n            Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head.\n\n  MACBETH. Tell me, thou unknown power-\n  FIRST WITCH. He knows thy thought:\n    Hear his speech, but say thou nought.\n  FIRST APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! Beware Macduff,\n    Beware the Thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.\n                                                       Descends.\n  MACBETH. Whate\'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;\n    Thou hast harp\'d my fear aright. But one word more-\n  FIRST WITCH. He will not be commanded. Here\'s another,\n    More potent than the first.\n\n          Thunder. Second Apparition: a bloody Child.\n \n  SECOND APPARITION. Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!\n  MACBETH. Had I three ears, I\'d hear thee.\n  SECOND APPARITION. Be bloody, bold, and resolute: laugh to\nscorn\n    The power of man, for none of woman born\n    Shall harm Macbeth.                                Descends.\n  MACBETH. Then live, Macduff. What need I fear of thee?\n    But yet I\'ll make assurance double sure,\n    And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live,\n    That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,\n    And sleep in spite of thunder.\n\n       Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,\n               with a tree in his hand.\n\n    What is this,\n    That rises like the issue of a king,\n    And wears upon his baby brow the round\n    And top of sovereignty?\n  ALL. Listen, but speak not to\'t.\n  THIRD APPARITION. Be lion-mettled, proud, and take no care \n    Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are.\n    Macbeth shall never vanquish\'d be until\n    Great Birnam Wood to high Dunsinane Hill\n    Shall come against him.                            Descends.\n  MACBETH. That will never be.\n    Who can impress the forest, bid the tree\n    Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements, good!\n    Rebellion\'s head, rise never till the Wood\n    Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth\n    Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath\n    To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart\n    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art\n    Can tell so much, shall Banquo\'s issue ever\n    Reign in this kingdom?\n  ALL. Seek to know no more.\n  MACBETH. I will be satisfied! Deny me this,\n    And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.\n    Why sinks that cauldron, and what noise is this?\n                                                       Hautboys.\n  FIRST WITCH. Show! \n  SECOND WITCH. Show!\n  THIRD. WITCH. Show!\n  ALL. Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;\n    Come like shadows, so depart!\n\n    A show of eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand;\n                   Banquo\'s Ghost following.\n\n  MACBETH. Thou are too like the spirit of Banquo Down!\n    Thy crown does sear mine eyeballs. And thy hair,\n    Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.\n    A third is like the former. Filthy hags!\n    Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!\n    What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?\n    Another yet! A seventh! I\'ll see no more!\n    And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass\n    Which shows me many more; and some I see\n    That twofold balls and treble sceptres carry.\n    Horrible sight! Now I see \'tis true;\n    For the blood-bolter\'d Banquo smiles upon me, \n    And points at them for his. What, is this so?\n  FIRST WITCH. Ay, sir, all this is so. But why\n    Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?\n    Come,sisters, cheer we up his sprites,\n    And show the best of our delights.\n    I\'ll charm the air to give a sound,\n    While you perform your antic round,\n    That this great King may kindly say\n    Our duties did his welcome pay.\n                                    Music. The Witches dance and\n                                        then vanish with Hecate.\n  MACBETH. are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour\n    Stand ay accursed in the calendar!\n    Come in, without there!\n\n                    Enter Lennox.\n\n  LENNOX. What\'s your Grace\'s will?\n  MACBETH. Saw you the weird sisters?\n  LENNOX. No, my lord. \n  MACBETH. Came they not by you?\n  LENNOX. No indeed, my lord.\n  MACBETH. Infected be the \'air whereon they ride,\n    And damn\'d all those that trust them! I did hear\n    The galloping of horse. Who wast came by?\n  LENNOX. \'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word\n    Macduff is fled to England.\n  MACBETH. Fled to England?\n  LENNOX. Ay, my good lord.\n  MACBETH. [Aside.] Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits.\n    The flighty purpose never is o\'ertook\n    Unless the deed go with it. From this moment\n    The very firstlings of my heart shall be\n    The firstlings of my hand. And even now,\n    To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:\n    The castle of Macduff I will surprise,\n    Seize upon Fife, give to the edge o\' the sword\n    His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls\n    That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;\n    This deed I\'ll do before this purpose cool. \n    But no more sights! -Where are these gentlemen?\n    Come, bring me where they are.                       Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nFife. Macduff\'s castle.\n\nEnter Lady Macduff, her Son, and Ross.\n\n  LADY MACDUFF. What had he done, to make him fly the land?\n  ROSS. You must have patience, madam.\n  LADY MACDUFF. He had none;\n    His flight was madness. When our actions do not,\n    Our fears do make us traitors.\n  ROSS. You know not\n    Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Wisdom? To leave his wife, to leave his babes,\n    His mansion, and his titles, in a place\n    From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;\n    He wants the natural touch; for the poor wren,\n    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,\n    Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.\n    All is the fear and nothing is the love;\n    As little is the wisdom, where the flight\n    So runs against all reason.\n  ROSS. My dearest coz, \n    I pray you, school yourself. But for your husband,\n    He is noble, wise, Judicious, and best knows\n    The fits o\' the season. I dare not speak much further;\n    But cruel are the times when we are traitors\n    And do not know ourselves; when we hold rumor\n    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,\n    But float upon a wild and violent sea\n    Each way and move. I take my leave of you;\n    Shall not be long but I\'ll be here again.\n    Things at the worst will cease or else climb upward\n    To what they were before. My pretty cousin,\n    Blessing upon you!\n  LADY MACDUFF. Father\'d he is, and yet he\'s fatherless.\n  ROSS. I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,\n    It would be my disgrace and your discomfort.\n    I take my leave at once.                               Exit.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Sirrah, your father\'s dead.\n    And what will you do now? How will you live?\n  SON. As birds do, Mother.\n  LADY MACDUFF. What, with worms and flies? \n  SON. With what I get, I mean; and so do they.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Poor bird! Thou\'ldst never fear the net nor lime,\n    The pitfall nor the gin.\n  SON. Why should I, Mother? Poor birds they are not set for.\n    My father is not dead, for all your saying.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Yes, he is dead. How wilt thou do for father?\n  SON. Nay, how will you do for a husband?\n  LADY MACDUFF. Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.\n  SON. Then you\'ll buy \'em to sell again.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Thou speak\'st with all thy wit, and yet, i\'\nfaith,\n    With wit enough for thee.\n  SON. Was my father a traitor, Mother?\n  LADY MACDUFF. Ay, that he was.\n  SON. What is a traitor?\n  LADY MACDUFF. Why one that swears and lies.\n  SON. And be all traitors that do so?\n  LADY MACDUFF. Everyone that does so is a traitor and must be\n     hanged.\n  SON. And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?\n  LADY MACDUFF. Everyone. \n  SON. Who must hang them?\n  LADY MACDUFF. Why, the honest men.\n  SON. Then the liars and swearers are fools, for there are liars\nand\n    swearers enow to beat the honest men and hang up them.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Now, God help thee, poor monkey! But how wilt\nthou do\n    for a father?\n  SON. If he were dead, you\'ld weep for him; if you would not, it\n    were a good sign that I should quickly have a new father.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Poor prattler, how thou talk\'st!\n\n                    Enter a Messenger.\n\n  MESSENGER. Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,\n    Though in your state of honor I am perfect.\n    I doubt some danger does approach you nearly.\n    If you will take a homely man\'s advice,\n    Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.\n    To fright you thus, methinks I am too savage;\n    To do worse to you were fell cruelty,\n    Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you! \n    I dare abide no longer.                                Exit.\n  LADY MACDUFF. Whither should I fly?\n    I have done no harm. But I remember now\n    I am in this earthly world, where to do harm\n    Is often laudable, to do good sometime\n    Accounted dangerous folly. Why then, alas,\n    Do I put up that womanly defense,\n    To say I have done no harm -What are these faces?\n\n                      Enter Murtherers.\n\n  FIRST MURTHERER. Where is your husband?\n  LADY MACDUFF. I hope, in no place so unsanctified\n    Where such as thou mayst find him.\n  FIRST MURTHERER. He\'s a traitor.\n  SON. Thou liest, thou shag-ear\'d villain!\n  FIRST MURTHERER. What, you egg!\n                                                      Stabs him.\n    Young fry of treachery!\n  SON. He has kill\'d me, Mother. \n    Run away, I pray you!                                  Dies.\n                            Exit Lady Macduff, crying "Murther!"\n                               Exeunt Murtherers, following her.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nEngland. Before the King\'s palace.\n\nEnter Malcolm and Macduff.\n\n  MALCOLM. Let us seek out some desolate shade and there\n    Weep our sad bosoms empty.\n  MACDUFF. Let us rather\n    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men\n    Bestride our downfall\'n birthdom. Each new morn\n    New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows\n    Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds\n    As if it felt with Scotland and yell\'d out\n    Like syllable of dolor.\n  MALCOLM. What I believe, I\'ll wall;\n    What know, believe; and what I can redress,\n    As I shall find the time to friend, I will.\n    What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.\n    This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,\n    Was once thought honest. You have loved him well;\n    He hath not touch\'d you yet. I am young, but something\n    You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom \n    To offer up a weak, poor, innocent lamb\n    To appease an angry god.\n  MACDUFF. I am not treacherous.\n  MALCOLM. But Macbeth is.\n    A good and virtuous nature may recoil\n    In an imperial charge. But I shall crave your pardon;\n    That which you are, my thoughts cannot transpose.\n    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell.\n    Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,\n    Yet grace must still look so.\n  MACDUFF. I have lost my hopes.\n  MALCOLM. Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.\n    Why in that rawness left you wife and child,\n    Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,\n    Without leave-taking? I pray you,\n    Let not my jealousies be your dishonors,\n    But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,\n    Whatever I shall think.\n  MACDUFF. Bleed, bleed, poor country!\n    Great tyranny, lay thou thy basis sure, \n    For goodness dare not check thee. Wear thou thy wrongs;\n    The title is affeer\'d. Fare thee well, lord.\n    I would not be the villain that thou think\'st\n    For the whole space that\'s in the tyrant\'s grasp\n    And the rich East to boot.\n  MALCOLM. Be not offended;\n    I speak not as in absolute fear of you.\n    I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\n    It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash\n    Is added to her wounds. I think withal\n    There would be hands uplifted in my right;\n    And here from gracious England have I offer\n    Of goodly thousands. But for all this,\n    When I shall tread upon the tyrant\'s head,\n    Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country\n    Shall have more vices than it had before,\n    More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,\n    By him that shall succeed.\n  MACDUFF. What should he be?\n  MALCOLM. It is myself I mean, in whom I know \n    All the particulars of vice so grafted\n    That, when they shall be open\'d, black Macbeth\n    Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state\n    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared\n    With my confineless harms.\n  MACDUFF. Not in the legions\n    Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn\'d\n    In evils to top Macbeth.\n  MALCOLM. I grant him bloody,\n    Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,\n    Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin\n    That has a name. But there\'s no bottom, none,\n    In my voluptuousness. Your wives, your daughters,\n    Your matrons, and your maids could not fill up\n    The cestern of my lust, and my desire\n    All continent impediments would o\'erbear\n    That did oppose my will. Better Macbeth\n    Than such an one to reign.\n  MACDUFF. Boundless intemperance\n    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been \n    The untimely emptying of the happy throne,\n    And fall of many kings. But fear not yet\n    To take upon you what is yours. You may\n    Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty\n    And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.\n    We have willing dames enough; there cannot be\n    That vulture in you to devour so many\n    As will to greatness dedicate themselves,\n    Finding it so inclined.\n  MALCOLM. With this there grows\n    In my most ill-composed affection such\n    A stanchless avarice that, were I King,\n    I should cut off the nobles for their lands,\n    Desire his jewels and this other\'s house,\n    And my more-having would be as a sauce\n    To make me hunger more, that I should forge\n    Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,\n    Destroying them for wealth.\n  MACDUFF. This avarice\n    Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root \n    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been\n    The sword of our slain kings. Yet do not fear;\n    Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will\n    Of your mere own. All these are portable,\n    With other graces weigh\'d.\n  MALCOLM. But I have none. The king-becoming graces,\n    As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,\n    Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,\n    Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,\n    I have no relish of them, but abound\n    In the division of each several crime,\n    Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should\n    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,\n    Uproar the universal peace, confound\n    All unity on earth.\n  MACDUFF. O Scotland, Scotland!\n  MALCOLM. If such a one be fit to govern, speak.\n    I am as I have spoken.\n  MACDUFF. Fit to govern?\n    No, not to live. O nation miserable! \n    With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter\'d,\n    When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,\n    Since that the truest issue of thy throne\n    By his own interdiction stands accursed\n    And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father\n    Was a most sainted king; the queen that bore thee,\n    Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,\n    Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!\n    These evils thou repeat\'st upon thyself\n    Have banish\'d me from Scotland. O my breast,\n    Thy hope ends here!\n  MALCOLM. Macduff, this noble passion,\n    Child of integrity, hath from my soul\n    Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts\n    To thy good truth and honor. Devilish Macbeth\n    By many of these trains hath sought to win me\n    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me\n    From over-credulous haste. But God above\n    Deal between thee and me! For even now\n    I put myself to thy direction and \n    Unspeak mine own detraction; here abjure\n    The taints and blames I laid upon myself,\n    For strangers to my nature. I am yet\n    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,\n    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,\n    At no time broke my faith, would not betray\n    The devil to his fellow, and delight\n    No less in truth than life. My first false speaking\n    Was this upon myself. What I am truly\n    Is thine and my poor country\'s to command.\n    Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,\n    Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men\n    Already at a point, was setting forth.\n    Now we\'ll together, and the chance of goodness\n    Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?\n  MACDUFF. Such welcome and unwelcome things at once\n    \'Tis hard to reconcile.\n\n                     Enter a Doctor.\n \n  MALCOLM. Well, more anon. Comes the King forth, I pray you?\n  DOCTOR. Ay, sir, there are a crew of wretched souls\n    That stay his cure. Their malady convinces\n    The great assay of art, but at his touch,\n    Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand,\n    They presently amend.\n  MALCOLM. I thank you, Doctor.                     Exit Doctor.\n  MACDUFF. What\'s the disease he means?\n  MALCOLM. \'Tis call\'d the evil:\n    A most miraculous work in this good King,\n    Which often, since my here-remain in England,\n    I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,\n    Himself best knows; but strangely-visited people,\n    All swol\'n and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,\n    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,\n    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks\n    Put on with holy prayers; and \'tis spoken,\n    To the succeeding royalty he leaves\n    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue\n    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy, \n    And sundry blessings hang about his throne\n    That speak him full of grace.\n\n                    Enter Ross.\n\n  MACDUFF. See, who comes here?\n  MALCOLM. My countryman, but yet I know him not.\n  MACDUFF. My ever gentle cousin, welcome hither.\n  MALCOLM. I know him now. Good God, betimes remove\n    The means that makes us strangers!\n  ROSS. Sir, amen.\n  MACDUFF. Stands Scotland where it did?\n  ROSS. Alas, poor country,\n    Almost afraid to know itself! It cannot\n    Be call\'d our mother, but our grave. Where nothing,\n    But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;\n    Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air,\n    Are made, not mark\'d; where violent sorrow seems\n    A modern ecstasy. The dead man\'s knell\n    Is there scarce ask\'d for who, and good men\'s lives \n    Expire before the flowers in their caps,\n    Dying or ere they sicken.\n  MACDUFF. O, relation\n    Too nice, and yet too true!\n  MALCOLM. What\'s the newest grief?\n  ROSS. That of an hour\'s age doth hiss the speaker;\n    Each minute teems a new one.\n  MACDUFF. How does my wife?\n  ROSS. Why, well.\n  MACDUFF. And all my children?\n  ROSS. Well too.\n  MACDUFF. The tyrant has not batter\'d at their peace?\n  ROSS. No, they were well at peace when I did leave \'em.\n  MACDUFF. Be not a niggard of your speech. How goest?\n  ROSS. When I came hither to transport the tidings,\n    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumor\n    Of many worthy fellows that were out,\n    Which was to my belief witness\'d the rather,\n    For that I saw the tyrant\'s power afoot.\n    Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland \n    Would create soldiers, make our women fight,\n    To doff their dire distresses.\n  MALCOLM. Be\'t their comfort\n    We are coming thither. Gracious England hath\n    Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;\n    An older and a better soldier none\n    That Christendom gives out.\n  ROSS. Would I could answer\n    This comfort with the like! But I have words\n    That would be howl\'d out in the desert air,\n    Where hearing should not latch them.\n  MACDUFF. What concern they?\n    The general cause? Or is it a fee-grief\n    Due to some single breast?\n  ROSS. No mind that\'s honest\n    But in it shares some woe, though the main part\n    Pertains to you alone.\n  MACDUFF. If it be mine,\n    Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.\n  ROSS. Let not your ears despise my tongue forever, \n    Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound\n    That ever yet they heard.\n  MACDUFF. Humh! I guess at it.\n  ROSS. Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes\n    Savagely slaughter\'d. To relate the manner\n    Were, on the quarry of these murther\'d deer,\n    To add the death of you.\n  MALCOLM. Merciful heaven!\n    What, man! Neer pull your hat upon your brows;\n    Give sorrow words. The grief that does not speak\n    Whispers the o\'erfraught heart, and bids it break.\n  MACDUFF. My children too?\n  ROSS. Wife, children, servants, all\n    That could be found.\n  MACDUFF. And I must be from thence!\n    My wife kill\'d too?\n  ROSS. I have said.\n  MALCOLM. Be comforted.\n    Let\'s make us medicines of our great revenge,\n    To cure this deadly grief. \n  MACDUFF. He has no children. All my pretty ones?\n    Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?\n    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam\n    At one fell swoop?\n  MALCOLM. Dispute it like a man.\n  MACDUFF. I shall do so,\n    But I must also feel it as a man.\n    I cannot but remember such things were\n    That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,\n    And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,\n    They were all struck for thee! Naught that I am,\n    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,\n    Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!\n  MALCOLM. Be this the whetstone of your sword. Let grief\n    Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.\n  MACDUFF. O, I could play the woman with mine eyes\n    And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,\n    Cut short all intermission; front to front\n    Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;\n    Within my sword\'s length set him; if he \'scape, \n    Heaven forgive him too!\n  MALCOLM. This tune goes manly.\n    Come, go we to the King; our power is ready,\n    Our lack is nothing but our leave. Macbeth\n    Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above\n    Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may,\n    The night is long that never finds the day.          Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Anteroom in the castle.\n\nEnter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting Gentlewoman.\n\n  DOCTOR. I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive no\n    truth in your report. When was it she last walked?\n  GENTLEWOMAN. Since his Majesty went into the field, have seen\nher\n    rise from her bed, throw her nightgown upon her, unlock her\n    closet, take forth paper, fold it, write upon\'t, read it,\n    afterwards seal it, and again return to bed; yet all this\nwhile\n    in a most fast sleep.\n  DOCTOR. A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once the\n    benefit of sleep and do the effects of watching! In this\nslumbery\n    agitation, besides her walking and other actual performances,\n    what, at any time, have you heard her say?\n  GENTLEWOMAN. That, sir, which I will not report after her.\n  DOCTOR. You may to me, and \'tis most meet you should.\n  GENTLEWOMAN. Neither to you nor anyone, having no witness to\n    confirm my speech.\n\n                Enter Lady Macbeth with a taper. \n\n    Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise, and, upon my\n    life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.\n  DOCTOR. How came she by that light?\n  GENTLEWOMAN. Why, it stood by her. She has light by her\n     continually; \'tis her command.\n  DOCTOR. You see, her eyes are open.\n  GENTLEWOMAN. Ay, but their sense is shut.\n  DOCTOR. What is it she does now? Look how she rubs her hands.\n  GENTLEWOMAN. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus\n    washing her hands. I have known her continue in this a\nquarter of\n    an hour.\n  LADY MACBETH. Yet here\'s a spot.\n  DOCTOR. Hark, she speaks! I will set down what comes from her,\nto\n    satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.\n  LADY MACBETH. Out, damned spot! Out, I say! One- two -why then\n\'tis\n    time to do\'t. Hell is murky. Fie, my lord, fie! A soldier,\nand\n    afeard? What need we fear who knows it, when none can call\nour\n    power to account? Yet who would have thought the old man to\nhave\n    had so much blood in him? \n  DOCTOR. Do you mark that?\n  LADY MACBETH. The Thane of Fife had a wife; where is she now?\nWhat,\n    will these hands neer be clean? No more o\' that, my lord, no\nmore\n    o\' that. You mar all with this starting.\n  DOCTOR. Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.\n  GENTLEWOMAN. She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of\nthat.\n    Heaven knows what she has known.\n  LADY MACBETH. Here\'s the smell of the blood still. All the\nperfumes\n    of Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh, oh, oh!\n  DOCTOR. What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.\n  GENTLEWOMAN. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the\n    dignity of the whole body.\n  DOCTOR. Well, well, well-\n  GENTLEWOMAN. Pray God it be, sir.\n  DOCTOR. This disease is beyond my practice. Yet I have known\nthose\n    which have walked in their sleep who have died holily in\ntheir\n    beds.\n  LADY MACBETH. Wash your hands, put on your nightgown, look not\nso\n    pale. I tell you yet again, Banquo\'s buried; he cannot come\nout\n    on\'s grave. \n  DOCTOR. Even so?\n  LADY MACBETH. To bed, to bed; there\'s knocking at the gate.\nCome,\n    come, come, come, give me your hand.What\'s done cannot be\nundone.\n    To bed, to bed, to bed.\nExit.\n  DOCTOR. Will she go now to bed?\n  GENTLEWOMAN. Directly.\n  DOCTOR. Foul whisperings are abroad. Unnatural deeds\n    Do breed unnatural troubles; infected minds\n    To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.\n    More needs she the divine than the physician.\n    God, God, forgive us all! Look after her;\n    Remove from her the means of all annoyance,\n    And still keep eyes upon her. So good night.\n    My mind she has mated and amazed my sight.\n    I think, but dare not speak.\n  GENTLEWOMAN. Good night, good doctor.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nThe country near Dunsinane. Drum and colors.\n\nEnter Menteith, Caithness, Angus, Lennox, and Soldiers.\n\n  MENTEITH. The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,\n    His uncle Siward, and the good Macduff.\n    Revenges burn in them, for their dear causes\n    Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm\n    Excite the mortified man.\n  ANGUS. Near Birnam Wood\n    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.\n  CAITHNESS. Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?\n  LENNOX. For certain, sir, he is not; I have a file\n    Of all the gentry. There is Seward\'s son\n    And many unrough youths that even now\n    Protest their first of manhood.\n  MENTEITH. What does the tyrant?\n  CAITHNESS. Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies.\n    Some say he\'s mad; others, that lesser hate him,\n    Do call it valiant fury; but, for certain,\n    He cannot buckle his distemper\'d cause \n    Within the belt of rule.\n  ANGUS. Now does he feel\n    His secret murthers sticking on his hands,\n    Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;\n    Those he commands move only in command,\n    Nothing in love. Now does he feel his title\n    Hang loose about him, like a giant\'s robe\n    Upon a dwarfish thief.\n  MENTEITH. Who then shall blame\n    His pester\'d senses to recoil and start,\n    When all that is within him does condemn\n    Itself for being there?\n  CAITHNESS. Well, march we on\n    To give obedience where \'tis truly owed.\n    Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,\n    And with him pour we, in our country\'s purge,\n    Each drop of us.\n  LENNOX. Or so much as it needs\n    To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.\n    Make we our march towards Birnam.           Exeunt marching.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nDunsinane. A room in the castle.\n\nEnter Macbeth, Doctor, and Attendants.\n\n  MACBETH. Bring me no more reports; let them fly all!\n    Till Birnam Wood remove to Dunsinane\n    I cannot taint with fear. What\'s the boy Malcolm?\n    Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know\n    All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:\n    "Fear not, Macbeth; no man that\'s born of woman\n    Shall e\'er have power upon thee." Then fly, false Thanes,\n    And mingle with the English epicures!\n    The mind I sway by and the heart I bear\n    Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.\n\n                       Enter a Servant.\n\n    The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!\n    Where got\'st thou that goose look?\n  SERVANT. There is ten thousand-\n  MACBETH. Geese, villain? \n  SERVANT. Soldiers, sir.\n  MACBETH. Go prick thy face and over-red thy fear,\n    Thou lily-liver\'d boy. What soldiers, patch?\n    Death of thy soul! Those linen cheeks of thine\n    Are counselors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?\n  SERVANT. The English force, so please you.\n  MACBETH. Take thy face hence.                    Exit Servant.\n    Seyton-I am sick at heart,\n    When I behold- Seyton, I say!- This push\n    Will cheer me ever or disseat me now.\n    I have lived long enough. My way of life\n    Is fall\'n into the sear, the yellow leaf,\n    And that which should accompany old age,\n    As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,\n    I must not look to have; but in their stead,\n    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honor, breath,\n    Which the poor heart would fain deny and dare not.\n    Seyton!\n\n                       Enter Seyton. \n\n  SEYTON. What\'s your gracious pleasure?\n  MACBETH. What news more?\n  SEYTON. All is confirm\'d, my lord, which was reported.\n  MACBETH. I\'ll fight, \'til from my bones my flesh be hack\'d.\n    Give me my armor.\n  SEYTON. \'Tis not needed yet.\n  MACBETH. I\'ll put it on.\n    Send out more horses, skirr the country round,\n    Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armor.\n    How does your patient, doctor?\n  DOCTOR. Not so sick, my lord,\n    As she is troubled with thick-coming fancies,\n    That keep her from her rest.\n  MACBETH. Cure her of that.\n    Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,\n    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,\n    Raze out the written troubles of the brain,\n    And with some sweet oblivious antidote\n    Cleanse the stuff\'d bosom of that perilous stuff \n    Which weighs upon the heart?\n  DOCTOR. Therein the patient\n    Must minister to himself.\n  MACBETH. Throw physic to the dogs, I\'ll none of it.\n    Come, put mine armor on; give me my staff.\n    Seyton, send out. Doctor, the Thanes fly from me.\n    Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast\n    The water of my land, find her disease\n    And purge it to a sound and pristine health,\n    I would applaud thee to the very echo,\n    That should applaud again. Pull\'t off, I say.\n    What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug\n    Would scour these English hence? Hearst thou of them?\n  DOCTOR. Ay, my good lord, your royal preparation\n    Makes us hear something.\n  MACBETH. Bring it after me.\n    I will not be afraid of death and bane\n    Till Birnam Forest come to Dunsinane.\n  DOCTOR. [Aside.] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,\n    Profit again should hardly draw me here.             Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nCountry near Birnam Wood. Drum and colors.\n\nEnter Malcolm, old Seward and his Son, Macduff, Menteith,\nCaithness,\nAngus, Lennox, Ross, and Soldiers, marching.\n\n  MALCOLM. Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand\n    That chambers will be safe.\n  MENTEITH. We doubt it nothing.\n  SIWARD. What wood is this before us?\n  MENTEITH. The Wood of Birnam.\n  MALCOLM. Let every soldier hew him down a bough,\n    And bear\'t before him; thereby shall we shadow\n    The numbers of our host, and make discovery\n    Err in report of us.\n  SOLDIERS. It shall be done.\n  SIWARD. We learn no other but the confident tyrant\n    Keeps still in Dunsinane and will endure\n    Our setting down before\'t.\n  MALCOLM. \'Tis his main hope;\n    For where there is advantage to be given,\n    Both more and less have given him the revolt, \n    And none serve with him but constrained things\n    Whose hearts are absent too.\n  MACDUFF. Let our just censures\n    Attend the true event, and put we on\n    Industrious soldiership.\n  SIWARD. The time approaches\n    That will with due decision make us know\n    What we shall say we have and what we owe.\n    Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,\n    But certain issue strokes must arbitrate.\n    Towards which advance the war.\n                                                Exeunt Marching.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\nDunsinane. Within the castle.\n\nEnter Macbeth, Seyton, and Soldiers, with drum and colors.\n\n  MACBETH. Hang out our banners on the outward walls;\n    The cry is still, "They come!" Our castle\'s strength\n    Will laugh a siege to scorn. Here let them lie\n    Till famine and the ague eat them up.\n    Were they not forced with those that should be ours,\n    We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,\n    And beat them backward home.\n                                          A cry of women within.\n    What is that noise?\n  SEYTON. It is the cry of women, my good lord.            Exit.\n  MACBETH. I have almost forgot the taste of fears:\n    The time has been, my senses would have cool\'d\n    To hear a night-shriek, and my fell of hair\n    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir\n    As life were in\'t. I have supp\'d full with horrors;\n    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts,\n    Cannot once start me. \n\n                  Re-enter Seyton.\n     Wherefore was that cry?\n  SEYTON. The Queen, my lord, is dead.\n  MACBETH. She should have died hereafter;\n    There would have been a time for such a word.\n    Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow\n    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day\n    To the last syllable of recorded time;\n    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!\n    Life\'s but a walking shadow, a poor player\n    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage\n    And then is heard no more. It is a tale\n    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\n    Signifying nothing.\n\n                 Enter a Messenger.\n\n    Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly. \n  MESSENGER. Gracious my lord,\n    I should report that which I say I saw,\n    But know not how to do it.\n  MACBETH. Well, say, sir.\n  MESSENGER. As I did stand my watch upon the hill,\n    I look\'d toward Birnam, and anon, methought,\n    The Wood began to move.\n  MACBETH. Liar and slave!\n  MESSENGER. Let me endure your wrath, if\'t be not so.\n    Within this three mile may you see it coming;\n    I say, a moving grove.\n  MACBETH. If thou speak\'st false,\n    Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,\n    Till famine cling thee; if thy speech be sooth,\n    I care not if thou dost for me as much.\n    I pull in resolution and begin\n    To doubt the equivocation of the fiend\n    That lies like truth. "Fear not, till Birnam Wood\n    Do come to Dunsinane," and now a wood\n    Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out! \n    If this which he avouches does appear,\n    There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.\n    I \'gin to be aweary of the sun\n    And wish the estate o\' the world were now undone.\n    Ring the alarum bell! Blow, wind! Come, wrack!\n    At least we\'ll die with harness on our back.         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\nDunsinane.  Before the castle.\n\nEnter Malcolm, old Siward, Macduff, and their Army, with boughs.\nDrum and colors.\n\n  MALCOLM. Now near enough; your leavy screens throw down,\n    And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,\n    Shall with my cousin, your right noble son,\n    Lead our first battle. Worthy Macduff and we\n    Shall take upon \'s what else remains to do,\n    According to our order.\n  SIWARD. Fare you well.\n    Do we but find the tyrant\'s power tonight,\n    Let us be beaten if we cannot fight.\n  MACDUFF. Make all our trumpets speak, give them all breath,\n    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.\n                                                         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\nDunsinane.  Before the castle.  Alarums.\n\nEnter Macbeth.\n\n  MACBETH. They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,\n    But bear-like I must fight the course. What\'s he\n    That was not born of woman? Such a one\n    Am I to fear, or none.\n\n                     Enter young Siward.\n\n  YOUNG SIWARD. What is thy name?\n  MACBETH. Thou\'lt be afraid to hear it.\n  YOUNG SIWARD. No, though thou call\'st thyself a hotter name\n    Than any is in hell.\n  MACBETH. My name\'s Macbeth.\n  YOUNG SIWARD. The devil himself could not pronounce a title\n    More hateful to mine ear.\n  MACBETH. No, nor more fearful.\n  YOUNG SIWARD O Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword\n    I\'ll prove the lie thou speak\'st. \n                          They fight, and young Seward is slain.\n  MACBETH. Thou wast born of woman.\n    But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,\n    Brandish\'d by man that\'s of a woman born.              Exit.\n\n                Alarums. Enter Macduff.\n\n  MACDUFF. That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!\n    If thou best slain and with no stroke of mine,\n    My wife and children\'s ghosts will haunt me still.\n    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms\n    Are hired to bear their staves. Either thou, Macbeth,\n    Or else my sword, with an unbatter\'d edge,\n    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;\n    By this great clatter, one of greatest note\n    Seems bruited. Let me find him, Fortune!\n    And more I beg not.                           Exit. Alarums.\n\n                Enter Malcolm and old Siward.\n \n  SIWARD. This way, my lord; the castle\'s gently render\'d.\n    The tyrant\'s people on both sides do fight,\n    The noble Thanes do bravely in the war,\n    The day almost itself professes yours,\n    And little is to do.\n  MALCOLM. We have met with foes\n    That strike beside us.\n  SIWARD. Enter, sir, the castle.\n                                                 Exeunt. Alarum.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\nAnother part of the field.\n\nEnter Macbeth.\n\n  MACBETH. Why should I play the Roman fool and die\n    On mine own sword? Whiles I see lives, the gashes\n    Do better upon them.\n\n                      Enter Macduff.\n\n  MACDUFF. Turn, hell hound, turn!\n  MACBETH. Of all men else I have avoided thee.\n    But get thee back, my soul is too much charged\n    With blood of thine already.\n  MACDUFF. I have no words.\n    My voice is in my sword, thou bloodier villain\n    Than terms can give thee out!                    They fight.\n  MACBETH. Thou losest labor.\n    As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air\n    With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed.\n    Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests; \n    I bear a charmed life, which must not yield\n    To one of woman born.\n  MACDUFF. Despair thy charm,\n    And let the angel whom thou still hast served\n    Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother\'s womb\n    Untimely ripp\'d.\n  MACBETH. Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,\n    For it hath cow\'d my better part of man!\n    And be these juggling fiends no more believed\n    That patter with us in a double sense,\n    That keep the word of promise to our ear\n    And break it to our hope. I\'ll not fight with thee.\n  MACDUFF. Then yield thee, coward,\n    And live to be the show and gaze o\' the time.\n    We\'ll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,\n    Painted upon a pole, and underwrit,\n    "Here may you see the tyrant."\n  MACBETH. I will not yield,\n    To kiss the ground before young Malcolm\'s feet,\n    And to be baited with the rabble\'s curse. \n    Though Birnam Wood be come to Dunsinane,\n    And thou opposed, being of no woman born,\n    Yet I will try the last. Before my body\n    I throw my warlike shield! Lay on, Macduff,\n    And damn\'d be him that first cries, "Hold, enough!"\n                                       Exeunt fighting. Alarums.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\n\nRetreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colors, Malcolm, old\nSiward, Ross,\nthe other Thanes, and Soldiers.\n\n  MALCOLM. I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.\n  SIWARD. Some must go off, and yet, by these I see,\n    So great a day as this is cheaply bought.\n  MALCOLM. Macduff is missing, and your noble son.\n  ROSS. Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier\'s debt.\n    He only lived but till he was a man,\n    The which no sooner had his prowess confirm\'d\n    In the unshrinking station where he fought,\n    But like a man he died.\n  SIWARD. Then he is dead?\n  ROSS. Ay, and brought off the field. Your cause of sorrow\n    Must not be measured by his worth, for then\n    It hath no end.\n  SIWARD. Had he his hurts before?\n  ROSS. Ay, on the front.\n  SIWARD. Why then, God\'s soldier be he!\n    Had I as many sons as I have hairs, \n    I would not wish them to a fairer death.\n    And so his knell is knoll\'d.\n  MALCOLM. He\'s worth more sorrow,\n    And that I\'ll spend for him.\n  SIWARD. He\'s worth no more:\n    They say he parted well and paid his score,\n    And so God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.\n\n             Re-enter Macduff, with Macbeth\'s head.\n\n  MACDUFF. Hail, King, for so thou art. Behold where stands\n    The usurper\'s cursed head. The time is free.\n    I see thee compass\'d with thy kingdom\'s pearl\n    That speak my salutation in their minds,\n    Whose voices I desire aloud with mine-\n    Hail, King of Scotland!\n  ALL. Hail, King of Scotland!                         Flourish.\n  MALCOLM. We shall not spend a large expense of time\n    Before we reckon with your several loves\n    And make us even with you. My Thanes and kinsmen, \n    Henceforth be Earls, the first that ever Scotland\n    In such an honor named. What\'s more to do,\n    Which would be planted newly with the time,\n    As calling home our exiled friends abroad\n    That fled the snares of watchful tyranny,\n    Producing forth the cruel ministers\n    Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,\n    Who, as \'tis thought, by self and violent hands\n    Took off her life; this, and what needful else\n    That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace\n    We will perform in measure, time, and place.\n    So thanks to all at once and to each one,\n    Whom we invite to see us crown\'d at Scone.\n                                               Flourish. Exeunt.\n     '

SCENE 1\n\nA hall in the DUKE\'S palace\n\nEnter the DUKE OF EPHESUS, AEGEON, the Merchant\nof Syracuse, GAOLER, OFFICERS, and other ATTENDANTS\n\nAEGEON. Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,\n  And by the doom of death end woes and all.\nDUKE. Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;\n  I am not partial to infringe our laws.\n  The enmity and discord which of late\n  Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke\n  To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,\n  Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,\n  Have seal\'d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,\n  Excludes all pity from our threat\'ning looks.\n  For, since the mortal and intestine jars\n  \'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,\n  It hath in solemn synods been decreed,\n  Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,\n  To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;\n  Nay, more: if any born at Ephesus\n  Be seen at any Syracusian marts and fairs;\n  Again, if any Syracusian born\n  Come to the bay of Ephesus-he dies,\n  His goods confiscate to the Duke\'s dispose,\n  Unless a thousand marks be levied,\n  To quit the penalty and to ransom him.\n  Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,\n  Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;\n  Therefore by law thou art condemn\'d to die.\nAEGEON. Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,\n  My woes end likewise with the evening sun.\nDUKE. Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause\n  Why thou departed\'st from thy native home,\n  And for what cause thou cam\'st to Ephesus.\nAEGEON. A heavier task could not have been impos\'d\n  Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;\n  Yet, that the world may witness that my end\n  Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,\n  I\'ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.\n  In Syracuse was I born, and wed\n  Unto a woman, happy but for me,\n  And by me, had not our hap been bad.\n  With her I liv\'d in joy; our wealth increas\'d\n  By prosperous voyages I often made\n  To Epidamnum; till my factor\'s death,\n  And the great care of goods at random left,\n  Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:\n  From whom my absence was not six months old,\n  Before herself, almost at fainting under\n  The pleasing punishment that women bear,\n  Had made provision for her following me,\n  And soon and safe arrived where I was.\n  There had she not been long but she became\n  A joyful mother of two goodly sons;\n  And, which was strange, the one so like the other\n  As could not be disdnguish\'d but by names.\n  That very hour, and in the self-same inn,\n  A mean woman was delivered\n  Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.\n  Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,\n  I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.\n  My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,\n  Made daily motions for our home return;\n  Unwilling, I agreed. Alas! too soon\n  We came aboard.\n  A league from Epidamnum had we sail\'d\n  Before the always-wind-obeying deep\n  Gave any tragic instance of our harm:\n  But longer did we not retain much hope,\n  For what obscured light the heavens did grant\n  Did but convey unto our fearful minds\n  A doubtful warrant of immediate death;\n  Which though myself would gladly have embrac\'d,\n  Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,\n  Weeping before for what she saw must come,\n  And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,\n  That mourn\'d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,\n  Forc\'d me to seek delays for them and me.\n  And this it was, for other means was none:\n  The sailors sought for safety by our boat,\n  And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us;\n  My wife, more careful for the latter-born,\n  Had fast\'ned him unto a small spare mast,\n  Such as sea-faring men provide for storms;\n  To him one of the other twins was bound,\n  Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.\n  The children thus dispos\'d, my wife and I,\n  Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix\'d,\n  Fast\'ned ourselves at either end the mast,\n  And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,\n  Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.\n  At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,\n  Dispers\'d those vapours that offended us;\n  And, by the benefit of his wished light,\n  The seas wax\'d calm, and we discovered\n  Two ships from far making amain to us-\n  Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.\n  But ere they came-O, let me say no more!\n  Gather the sequel by that went before.\nDUKE. Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so;\n  For we may pity, though not pardon thee.\nAEGEON. O, had the gods done so, I had not now\n  Worthily term\'d them merciless to us!\n  For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,\n  We were encount\'red by a mighty rock,\n  Which being violently borne upon,\n  Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;\n  So that, in this unjust divorce of us,\n  Fortune had left to both of us alike\n  What to delight in, what to sorrow for.\n  Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened\n  With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,\n  Was carried with more speed before the wind;\n  And in our sight they three were taken up\n  By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.\n  At length another ship had seiz\'d on us;\n  And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,\n  Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wreck\'d guests,\n  And would have reft the fishers of their prey,\n  Had not their bark been very slow of sail;\n  And therefore homeward did they bend their course.\n  Thus have you heard me sever\'d from my bliss,\n  That by misfortunes was my life prolong\'d,\n  To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.\nDUKE. And, for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,\n  Do me the favour to dilate at full\n  What have befall\'n of them and thee till now.\nAEGEON. My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,\n  At eighteen years became inquisitive\n  After his brother, and importun\'d me\n  That his attendant-so his case was like,\n  Reft of his brother, but retain\'d his name-\n  Might bear him company in the quest of him;\n  Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,\n  I hazarded the loss of whom I lov\'d.\n  Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,\n  Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,\n  And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;\n  Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought\n  Or that or any place that harbours men.\n  But here must end the story of my life;\n  And happy were I in my timely death,\n  Could all my travels warrant me they live.\nDUKE. Hapless, Aegeon, whom the fates have mark\'d\n  To bear the extremity of dire mishap!\n  Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,\n  Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,\n  Which princes, would they, may not disannul,\n  My soul should sue as advocate for thee.\n  But though thou art adjudged to the death,\n  And passed sentence may not be recall\'d\n  But to our honour\'s great disparagement,\n  Yet will I favour thee in what I can.\n  Therefore, merchant, I\'ll limit thee this day\n  To seek thy help by beneficial hap.\n  Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;\n  Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,\n  And live; if no, then thou art doom\'d to die.\n  Gaoler, take him to thy custody.\nGAOLER. I will, my lord.\nAEGEON. Hopeless and helpless doth Aegeon wend,\n  But to procrastinate his lifeless end.\n<Exeunt\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\nThe mart\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and FIRST\nMERCHANT\n\nFIRST MERCHANT. Therefore, give out you are of Epidamnum,\n  Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.\n  This very day a Syracusian merchant\n  Is apprehended for arrival here;\n  And, not being able to buy out his life,\n  According to the statute of the town,\n  Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.\n  There is your money that I had to keep.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host.\n  And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.\n  Within this hour it will be dinner-time;\n  Till that, I\'ll view the manners of the town,\n  Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,\n  And then return and sleep within mine inn;\n  For with long travel I am stiff and weary.\n  Get thee away.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Many a man would take you at your word,\n  And go indeed, having so good a mean.\n<Exit\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,\n  When I am dull with care and melancholy,\n  Lightens my humour with his merry jests.\n  What, will you walk with me about the town,\n  And then go to my inn and dine with me?\nFIRST MERCHANT. I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,\n  Of whom I hope to make much benefit;\n  I crave your pardon. Soon at five o\'clock,\n  Please you, I\'ll meet with you upon the mart,\n  And afterward consort you till bed time.\n  My present business calls me from you now.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Farewell till then. I will go lose\nmyself,\n  And wander up and down to view the city.\nFIRST MERCHANT. Sir, I commend you to your own content.\n<Exit FIRST MERCHANT\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He that commends me to mine own content\n  Commends me to the thing I cannot get.\n  I to the world am like a drop of water\n  That in the ocean seeks another drop,\n  Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,\n  Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself.\n  So I, to find a mother and a brother,\n  In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.\n\nEnter DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\n  Here comes the almanac of my true date.\n  What now? How chance thou art return\'d so soon?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Return\'d so soon! rather approach\'d too late.\n  The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit;\n  The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell-\n  My mistress made it one upon my cheek;\n  She is so hot because the meat is cold,\n  The meat is cold because you come not home,\n  You come not home because you have no stomach,\n  You have no stomach, having broke your fast;\n  But we, that know what \'tis to fast and pray,\n  Are penitent for your default to-day.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Stop in your wind, sir; tell me this, I\npray:\n  Where have you left the money that I gave you?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. O-Sixpence that I had a Wednesday last\n  To pay the saddler for my mistress\' crupper?\n  The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I am not in a sportive humour now;\n  Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?\n  We being strangers here, how dar\'st thou trust\n  So great a charge from thine own custody?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I pray you jest, sir, as you sit at dinner.\n  I from my mistress come to you in post;\n  If I return, I shall be post indeed,\n  For she will score your fault upon my pate.\n  Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,\n  And strike you home without a messenger.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out\nof season;\n  Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.\n  Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. To me, sir? Why, you gave no gold to me.\n  ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come on, sir knave, have done your\nfoolishness,\n  And tell me how thou hast dispos\'d thy charge.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. My charge was but to fetch you from the mart\n  Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner.\n  My mistress and her sister stays for you.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Now, as I am a Christian, answer me\n  In what safe place you have bestow\'d my money,\n  Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours,\n  That stands on tricks when I am undispos\'d.\n  Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I have some marks of yours upon my pate,\n  Some of my mistress\' marks upon my shoulders,\n  But not a thousand marks between you both.\n  If I should pay your worship those again,\n  Perchance you will not bear them patiently.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy mistress\' marks! What mistress,\nslave, hast thou?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Your worship\'s wife, my mistress at the\nPhoenix;\n  She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,\n  And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my\nface,\n  Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.\n[Beats him]\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. What mean you, sir? For God\'s sake hold your\nhands!\n  Nay, an you will not, sir, I\'ll take my heels.\n<Exit\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Upon my life, by some device or other\n  The villain is o\'erraught of all my money.\n  They say this town is full of cozenage;\n  As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,\n  Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,\n  Soul-killing witches that deform the body,\n  Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,\n  And many such-like liberties of sin;\n  If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.\n  I\'ll to the Centaur to go seek this slave.\n  I greatly fear my money is not safe.\n<Exit\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

SCENE 1\n\nThe house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS\n\nEnter ADRIANA, wife to ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, with LUCIANA, her\nsister\n\nADRIANA. Neither my husband nor the slave return\'d\n  That in such haste I sent to seek his master!\n  Sure, Luciana, it is two o\'clock.\nLUCIANA. Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,\n  And from the mart he\'s somewhere gone to dinner;\n  Good sister, let us dine, and never fret.\n  A man is master of his liberty;\n  Time is their master, and when they see time,\n  They\'ll go or come. If so, be patient, sister.\nADRIANA. Why should their liberty than ours be more?\nLUCIANA. Because their business still lies out o\' door.\nADRIANA. Look when I serve him so, he takes it ill.\nLUCIANA. O, know he is the bridle of your will.\nADRIANA. There\'s none but asses will be bridled so.\nLUCIANA. Why, headstrong liberty is lash\'d with woe.\n  There\'s nothing situate under heaven\'s eye\n  But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky.\n  The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,\n  Are their males\' subjects, and at their controls.\n  Man, more divine, the master of all these,\n  Lord of the wide world and wild wat\'ry seas,\n  Indu\'d with intellectual sense and souls,\n  Of more pre-eminence than fish and fowls,\n  Are masters to their females, and their lords;\n  Then let your will attend on their accords.\nADRIANA. This servitude makes you to keep unwed.\nLUCIANA. Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.\nADRIANA. But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.\nLUCIANA. Ere I learn love, I\'ll practise to obey.\nADRIANA. How if your husband start some other where?\nLUCIANA. Till he come home again, I would forbear.\nADRIANA. Patience unmov\'d! no marvel though she pause:\n  They can be meek that have no other cause.\n  A wretched soul, bruis\'d with adversity,\n  We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;\n  But were we burd\'ned with like weight of pain,\n  As much, or more, we should ourselves complain.\n  So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,\n  With urging helpless patience would relieve me;\n  But if thou live to see like right bereft,\n  This fool-begg\'d patience in thee will be left.\nLUCIANA. Well, I will marry one day, but to try.\n  Here comes your man, now is your husband nigh.\n\nEnter DROMIO OF EPHESUS\n\nADRIANA. Say, is your tardy master now at hand?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he\'s at two hands with me, and that my\ntwo\n  ears can witness.\nADRIANA. Say, didst thou speak with him? Know\'st thou his mind?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear.\n  Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.\nLUCIANA. Spake he so doubtfully thou could\'st not feel his\nmeaning?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, he struck so plainly I could to\n  well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could\n  scarce understand them.\nADRIANA. But say, I prithee, is he coming home?\n  It seems he hath great care to please his wife.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.\nADRIANA. Horn-mad, thou villain!\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I mean not cuckold-mad;\n  But, sure, he is stark mad.\n  When I desir\'d him to come home to dinner,\n  He ask\'d me for a thousand marks in gold.\n  "Tis dinner time\' quoth I; \'My gold!\' quoth he.\n  \'Your meat doth burn\' quoth I; \'My gold!\' quoth he.\n  \'Will you come home?\' quoth I; \'My gold!\' quoth he.\n  \'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?\'\n  \'The pig\' quoth I \'is burn\'d\'; \'My gold!\' quoth he.\n  \'My mistress, sir,\' quoth I; \'Hang up thy mistress;\n  I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress.\'\nLUCIANA. Quoth who?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Quoth my master.\n  \'I know\' quoth he \'no house, no wife, no mistress.\'\n  So that my errand, due unto my tongue,\n  I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;\n  For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.\nADRIANA. Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Go back again, and be new beaten home?\n  For God\'s sake, send some other messenger.\nADRIANA. Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. And he will bless that cross with other\nbeating;\n  Between you I shall have a holy head.\nADRIANA. Hence, prating peasant! Fetch thy master home.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Am I so round with you, as you with me,\n  That like a football you do spurn me thus?\n  You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither;\n  If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.\n<Exit\nLUCIANA. Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!\nADRIANA. His company must do his minions grace,\n  Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.\n  Hath homely age th\' alluring beauty took\n  From my poor cheek? Then he hath wasted it.\n  Are my discourses dull? Barren my wit?\n  If voluble and sharp discourse be marr\'d,\n  Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard.\n  Do their gay vestments his affections bait?\n  That\'s not my fault; he\'s master of my state.\n  What ruins are in me that can be found\n  By him not ruin\'d? Then is he the ground\n  Of my defeatures. My decayed fair\n  A sunny look of his would soon repair.\n  But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale,\n  And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.\nLUCIANA. Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence.\nADRIANA. Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.\n  I know his eye doth homage otherwhere;\n  Or else what lets it but he would be here?\n  Sister, you know he promis\'d me a chain;\n  Would that alone a love he would detain,\n  So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!\n  I see the jewel best enamelled\n  Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still\n  That others touch and, often touching, will\n  Where gold; and no man that hath a name\n  By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.\n  Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,\n  I\'ll weep what\'s left away, and weeping die.\nLUCIANA. How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!\n<Exeunt\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\nThe mart\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up\n  Safe at the Centaur, and the heedful slave\n  Is wand\'red forth in care to seek me out.\n  By computation and mine host\'s report\n  I could not speak with Dromio since at first\n  I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.\n\nEnter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\n  How now, sir, is your merry humour alter\'d?\n  As you love strokes, so jest with me again.\n  You know no Centaur! You receiv\'d no gold!\n  Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner!\n  My house was at the Phoenix! Wast thou mad,\n  That thus so madly thou didst answer me?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. What answer, sir? When spake I such a word?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Even now, even here, not half an hour\nsince.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I did not see you since you sent me hence,\n  Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou didst deny the gold\'s\nreceipt,\n  And told\'st me of a mistress and a dinner;\n  For which, I hope, thou felt\'st I was displeas\'d.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am glad to see you in this merry vein.\n  What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the\nteeth?\n  Think\'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.\n[Beating him]\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Hold, sir, for God\'s sake! Now your jest is\nearnest.\n  Upon what bargain do you give it me?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Because that I familiarly sometimes\n  Do use you for my fool and chat with you,\n  Your sauciness will jest upon my love,\n  And make a common of my serious hours.\n  When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,\n  But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.\n  If you will jest with me, know my aspect,\n  And fashion your demeanour to my looks,\n  Or I will beat this method in your sconce.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sconce, call you it? So you would\n  leave battering, I had rather have it a head. An you use\n  these blows long, I must get a sconce for my head, and\n  insconce it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.\n  But I pray, sir, why am I beaten?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Dost thou not know?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Shall I tell you why?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say\n  every why hath a wherefore.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, first for flouting me; and then\nwherefore,\n  For urging it the second time to me.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Was there ever any man thus beaten out of\nseason,\n  When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason?\n  Well, sir, I thank you.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thank me, sir! for what?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, for this something that you gave\n  me for nothing.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I\'ll make you amends next, to\n  give you nothing for something. But say, sir, is it dinnertime?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In good time, sir, what\'s that?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Basting.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, then \'twill be dry.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. If it be, sir, I pray you eat none of it.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Your reason?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Lest it make you choleric, and purchase me\n  another dry basting.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, learn to jest in good time;\n  there\'s a time for all things.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I durst have denied that, before you\n  were so choleric.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By what rule, sir?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the\n  plain bald pate of Father Time himself.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Let\'s hear it.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There\'s no time for a man to recover\n  his hair that grows bald by nature.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. May he not do it by fine and recovery?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and\n  recover the lost hair of another man.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why is Time such a niggard of\n  hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an excrement?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Because it is a blessing that he bestows\n  on beasts, and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath\n  given them in wit.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, but there\'s many a man\n  hath more hair than wit.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not a man of those but he hath the\n  wit to lose his hair.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, thou didst conclude hairy\n  men plain dealers without wit.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The plainer dealer, the sooner lost;\n  yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For what reason?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. For two; and sound ones too.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sound I pray you.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Sure ones, then.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Certain ones, then.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Name them.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. The one, to save the money that he spends in\n  tiring; the other, that at dinner they should not drop in his\n  porridge.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. You would all this time have prov\'d there\n  is no time for all things.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to\nrecover\n  hair lost by nature.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. But your reason was not substantial, why\n  there is no time to recover.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald,\n  and therefore to the world\'s end will have bald followers.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I knew \'t\'would be a bald conclusion.\nBut,\n  soft, who wafts us yonder?\n\nEnter ADRIANA and LUCIANA\n\nADRIANA. Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown.\n  Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;\n  I am not Adriana, nor thy wife.\n  The time was once when thou unurg\'d wouldst vow\n  That never words were music to thine ear,\n  That never object pleasing in thine eye,\n  That never touch well welcome to thy hand,\n  That never meat sweet-savour\'d in thy taste,\n  Unless I spake, or look\'d, or touch\'d, or carv\'d to thee.\n  How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,\n  That thou art then estranged from thyself?\n  Thyself I call it, being strange to me,\n  That, undividable, incorporate,\n  Am better than thy dear self\'s better part.\n  Ah, do not tear away thyself from me;\n  For know, my love, as easy mayst thou fall\n  A drop of water in the breaking gulf,\n  And take unmingled thence that drop again\n  Without addition or diminishing,\n  As take from me thyself, and not me too.\n  How dearly would it touch thee to the quick,\n  Should\'st thou but hear I were licentious,\n  And that this body, consecrate to thee,\n  By ruffian lust should be contaminate!\n  Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me,\n  And hurl the name of husband in my face,\n  And tear the stain\'d skin off my harlot-brow,\n  And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring,\n  And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?\n  I know thou canst, and therefore see thou do it.\n  I am possess\'d with an adulterate blot;\n  My blood is mingled with the crime of lust;\n  For if we two be one, and thou play false,\n  I do digest the poison of thy flesh,\n  Being strumpeted by thy contagion.\n  Keep then fair league and truce with thy true bed;\n  I live dis-stain\'d, thou undishonoured.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you\nnot:\n  In Ephesus I am but two hours old,\n  As strange unto your town as to your talk,\n  Who, every word by all my wit being scann\'d,\n  Wants wit in all one word to understand.\nLUCIANA. Fie, brother, how the world is chang\'d with you!\n  When were you wont to use my sister thus?\n  She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. By Dromio?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By me?\nADRIANA. By thee; and this thou didst return from him-\n  That he did buffet thee, and in his blows\n  Denied my house for his, me for his wife.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Did you converse, sir, with this\ngentlewoman?\n  What is the course and drift of your compact?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, Sir? I never saw her till this time.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Villain, thou liest; for even her very\nwords\n  Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I never spake with her in all my life.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How can she thus, then, call us by our\nnames,\n  Unless it be by inspiration?\nADRIANA. How ill agrees it with your gravity\n  To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,\n  Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!\n  Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,\n  But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.\n  Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine;\n  Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,\n  Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,\n  Makes me with thy strength to communicate.\n  If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,\n  Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;\n  Who all, for want of pruning, with intrusion\n  Infect thy sap, and live on thy confusion.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. To me she speaks; she moves me for her\ntheme.\n  What, was I married to her in my dream?\n  Or sleep I now, and think I hear all this?\n  What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?\n  Until I know this sure uncertainty,\n  I\'ll entertain the offer\'d fallacy.\nLUCIANA. Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, for my beads! I cross me for sinner.\n  This is the fairy land. O spite of spites!\n  We talk with goblins, owls, and sprites.\n  If we obey them not, this will ensue:\n  They\'ll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.\nLUCIANA. Why prat\'st thou to thyself, and answer\'st not?\n  Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am transformed, master, am not I?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think thou art in mind, and so am I.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou hast thine own form.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, I am an ape.\nLUCIANA. If thou art chang\'d to aught, \'tis to an ass.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. \'Tis true; she rides me, and I long for\ngrass.\n  \'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be\n  But I should know her as well as she knows me.\nADRIANA. Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,\n  To put the finger in the eye and weep,\n  Whilst man and master laughs my woes to scorn.\n  Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.\n  Husband, I\'ll dine above with you to-day,\n  And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.\n  Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,\n  Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.\n  Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?\n  Sleeping or waking, mad or well-advis\'d?\n  Known unto these, and to myself disguis\'d!\n  I\'ll say as they say, and persever so,\n  And in this mist at all adventures go.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I be porter at the gate?\nADRIANA. Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.\nLUCIANA. Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.\n<Exeunt\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

SCENE 1\n\nBefore the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, DROMIO OF EPHESUS, ANGELO, and\nBALTHAZAR\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us\nall;\n  My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours.\n  Say that I linger\'d with you at your shop\n  To see the making of her carcanet,\n  And that to-morrow you will bring it home.\n  But here\'s a villain that would face me down\n  He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,\n  And charg\'d him with a thousand marks in gold,\n  And that I did deny my wife and house.\n  Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Say what you will, sir, but I know what I\nknow.\n  That you beat me at the mart I have your hand to show;\n  If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,\n  Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I think thou art an ass.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Marry, so it doth appear\n  By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.\n  I should kick, being kick\'d; and being at that pass,\n  You would keep from my heels, and beware of an ass.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Y\'are sad, Signior Balthazar; pray God our\ncheer\n  May answer my good will and your good welcome here.\nBALTHAZAR. I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your welcome\ndear.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or\nfish,\n  A table full of welcome makes scarce one dainty dish.\nBALTHAZAR. Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And welcome more common; for that\'s\nnothing\n  but words.\nBALTHAZAR. Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Ay, to a niggardly host and more sparing\nguest.\n  But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;\n  Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.\n  But, soft, my door is lock\'d; go bid them let us in.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicely, Gillian, Ginn!\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,\nidiot, patch!\n  Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.\n  Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call\'st for such\nstore,\n  When one is one too many? Go get thee from the door.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. What patch is made our porter?\n  My master stays in the street.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Let him walk from whence he came,\n    lest he catch cold on\'s feet.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Who talks within there? Ho, open the door!\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Right, sir; I\'ll tell you when,\n    an you\'ll tell me wherefore.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wherefore? For my dinner;\n    I have not din\'d to-day.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Nor to-day here you must not;\n    come again when you may.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What art thou that keep\'st me out\n    from the house I owe?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  The porter for this time,\n    sir, and my name is Dromio.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Villain, thou hast stol\'n both mine\n    office and my name!\n  The one ne\'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.\n  If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,\n  Thou wouldst have chang\'d thy face for a name, or thy name for\nan ass.\n\nEnter LUCE, within\n\nLUCE.  [Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? Who are those at\nthe gate?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Let my master in, Luce.\nLUCE.  [Within]  Faith, no, he comes too late;\n  And so tell your master.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. O Lord, I must laugh!\n  Have at you with a proverb: Shall I set in my staff?\nLUCE.  [Within]  Have at you with another: that\'s-when? can you\ntell?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  If thy name be called Luce\n    -Luce, thou hast answer\'d him well.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do you hear, you minion? You\'ll let us in,\nI hope?\nLUCE.  [Within]  I thought to have ask\'d you.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  And you said no.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. SO, Come, help: well struck! there was blow\nfor blow.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou baggage, let me in.\nLUCE.  [Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, knock the door hard.\nLUCE.  [Within]  Let him knock till it ache.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You\'ll cry for this, minion, if beat the\ndoor down.\nLUCE.  [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the\ntown?\n\nEnter ADRIANA, within\n\nADRIANA.  [Within]  Who is that at the door, that keeps all this\nnoise?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  By my troth, your town is\n    troubled with unruly boys.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Are you there, wife? You might\n    have come before.\nADRIANA.  [Within]  Your wife, sir knave! Go get you from the\ndoor.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. If YOU went in pain, master, this \'knave\'\nwould go sore.\nANGELO. Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome; we would fain\nhave either.\nBALTHAZAR. In debating which was best, we shall part with\nneither.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. They stand at the door, master; bid them\nwelcome hither.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is something in the wind, that we\ncannot get in.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. You would say so, master, if your garments\nwere thin.\n  Your cake here is warm within; you stand here in the cold;\n  It would make a man mad as a buck to be so bought and sold.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go fetch me something; I\'ll break ope the\ngate.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Break any breaking here,\n    and I\'ll break your knave\'s pate.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. A man may break a word with you,\n    sir; and words are but wind;\n  Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  It seems thou want\'st breaking;\n    out upon thee, hind!\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here\'s too much \'out upon thee!\' pray thee let\nme in.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.  [Within]  Ay, when fowls have no\n    feathers and fish have no fin.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Well, I\'ll break in; go borrow me a crow.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?\n  For a fish without a fin, there\'s a fowl without a feather;\n  If a crow help us in, sirrah, we\'ll pluck a crow together.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.\nBALTHAZAR. Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!\n  Herein you war against your reputation,\n  And draw within the compass of suspect\n  Th\' unviolated honour of your wife.\n  Once this-your long experience of her wisdom,\n  Her sober virtue, years, and modesty,\n  Plead on her part some cause to you unknown;\n  And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse\n  Why at this time the doors are made against you.\n  Be rul\'d by me: depart in patience,\n  And let us to the Tiger all to dinner;\n  And, about evening, come yourself alone\n  To know the reason of this strange restraint.\n  If by strong hand you offer to break in\n  Now in the stirring passage of the day,\n  A vulgar comment will be made of it,\n  And that supposed by the common rout\n  Against your yet ungalled estimation\n  That may with foul intrusion enter in\n  And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;\n  For slander lives upon succession,\n  For ever hous\'d where it gets possession.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You have prevail\'d. I will depart in\nquiet,\n  And in despite of mirth mean to be merry.\n  I know a wench of excellent discourse,\n  Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle;\n  There will we dine. This woman that I mean,\n  My wife-but, I protest, without desert-\n  Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal;\n  To her will we to dinner.  [To ANGELO]  Get you home\n  And fetch the chain; by this I know \'tis made.\n  Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;\n  For there\'s the house. That chain will I bestow-\n  Be it for nothing but to spite my wife-\n  Upon mine hostess there; good sir, make haste.\n  Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,\n  I\'ll knock elsewhere, to see if they\'ll disdain me.\nANGELO. I\'ll meet you at that place some hour hence.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Do so; this jest shall cost me some\nexpense.\n<Exeunt\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\nBefore the house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS\n\nEnter LUCIANA with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE\n\nLUCIANA. And may it be that you have quite forgot\n  A husband\'s office? Shall, Antipholus,\n  Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?\n  Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?\n  If you did wed my sister for her wealth,\n  Then for her wealth\'s sake use her with more kindness;\n  Or, if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;\n  Muffle your false love with some show of blindness;\n  Let not my sister read it in your eye;\n  Be not thy tongue thy own shame\'s orator;\n  Look sweet, speak fair, become disloyalty;\n  Apparel vice like virtue\'s harbinger;\n  Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;\n  Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;\n  Be secret-false. What need she be acquainted?\n  What simple thief brags of his own attaint?\n  \'Tis double wrong to truant with your bed\n  And let her read it in thy looks at board;\n  Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;\n  Ill deeds is doubled with an evil word.\n  Alas, poor women! make us but believe,\n  Being compact of credit, that you love us;\n  Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;\n  We in your motion turn, and you may move us.\n  Then, gentle brother, get you in again;\n  Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife.\n  \'Tis holy sport to be a little vain\n  When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Sweet mistress-what your name is else, I\nknow not,\n  Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine-\n  Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not\n  Than our earth\'s wonder-more than earth, divine.\n  Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;\n  Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,\n  Smoth\'red in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,\n  The folded meaning of your words\' deceit.\n  Against my soul\'s pure truth why labour you\n  To make it wander in an unknown field?\n  Are you a god? Would you create me new?\n  Transform me, then, and to your pow\'r I\'ll yield.\n  But if that I am I, then well I know\n  Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,\n  Nor to her bed no homage do I owe;\n  Far more, far more, to you do I decline.\n  O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,\n  To drown me in thy sister\'s flood of tears.\n  Sing, siren, for thyself, and I will dote;\n  Spread o\'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,\n  And as a bed I\'ll take them, and there he;\n  And in that glorious supposition think\n  He gains by death that hath such means to die.\n  Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink.\nLUCIANA. What, are you mad, that you do reason so?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.\nLUCIANA. It is a fault that springeth from your eye.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being\nby.\nLUCIANA. Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. As good to wink, sweet love, as look on\nnight.\nLUCIANA. Why call you me love? Call my sister so.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thy sister\'s sister.\nLUCIANA. That\'s my sister.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No;\n  It is thyself, mine own self\'s better part;\n  Mine eye\'s clear eye, my dear heart\'s dearer heart,\n  My food, my fortune, and my sweet hope\'s aim,\n  My sole earth\'s heaven, and my heaven\'s claim.\nLUCIANA. All this my sister is, or else should be.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am\nthee;\n  Thee will I love, and with thee lead my life;\n  Thou hast no husband yet, nor I no wife.\n  Give me thy hand.\nLUCIANA. O, soft, sir, hold you still;\n  I\'ll fetch my sister to get her good will.\n<Exit LUCIANA\n\nEnter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, how now, Dromio! Where run\'st thou\n  so fast?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Do you know me, sir? Am I Dromio?\n  Am I your man? Am I myself?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art Dromio, thou art my\n  man, thou art thyself.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I am an ass, I am a woman\'s man, and besides\n  myself.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What woman\'s man, and how besides\nthyself?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due\n  to a woman-one that claims me, one that haunts me, one\n  that will have me.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What claim lays she to thee?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, such claim as you would\n  lay to your horse; and she would have me as a beast: not\n  that, I being a beast, she would have me; but that she,\n  being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is she?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A very reverent body; ay, such a one\n  as a man may not speak of without he say \'Sir-reverence.\'\n  I have but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a\n  wondrous fat marriage.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. How dost thou mean a fat marriage?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, she\'s the kitchen-wench,\n  and all grease; and I know not what use to put her to but\n  to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light.\n  I warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn\n  Poland winter. If she lives till doomsday, she\'ll burn\n  week longer than the whole world.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What complexion is she of?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Swart, like my shoe; but her face\n  nothing like so clean kept; for why, she sweats, a man may\n  go over shoes in the grime of it.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. That\'s a fault that water will mend.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, \'tis in grain; Noah\'s flood\n  could not do it.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What\'s her name?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nell, sir; but her name and three\n  quarters, that\'s an ell and three quarters, will not measure\n  her from hip to hip.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Then she bears some breadth?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No longer from head to foot than\n  from hip to hip: she is spherical, like a globe; I could find\n  out countries in her.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. In what part of her body stands Ireland?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, sir, in her buttocks; I found it out\nby\n  the bogs.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Scotland?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I found it by the barrenness, hard in\n  the palm of the hand.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where France?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. In her forehead, arm\'d and reverted,\n  making war against her heir.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where England?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I look\'d for the chalky cliffs, but I\n  could find no whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her\n  chin, by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where Spain?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, I saw it not, but I felt it hot in\n  her breath.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where America, the Indies?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, sir, upon her nose, an o\'er embellished\nwith\n  rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich aspect to\nthe\n  hot breath of Spain; who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be\n  ballast at her nose.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, Sir, I did not look so low. To\n  conclude: this drudge or diviner laid claim to me; call\'d me\n  Dromio; swore I was assur\'d to her; told me what privy\n  marks I had about me, as, the mark of my shoulder, the\n  mole in my neck, the great wart on my left arm, that I,\n  amaz\'d, ran from her as a witch.\n  And, I think, if my breast had not been made of faith,\n    and my heart of steel,\n  She had transform\'d me to a curtal dog, and made me turn i\' th\'\nwheel.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Go hie thee presently post to the road;\n  An if the wind blow any way from shore,\n  I will not harbour in this town to-night.\n  If any bark put forth, come to the mart,\n  Where I will walk till thou return to me.\n  If every one knows us, and we know none,\n  \'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. As from a bear a man would run for life,\n  So fly I from her that would be my wife.\n<Exit\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There\'s none but witches do inhabit here,\n  And therefore \'tis high time that I were hence.\n  She that doth call me husband, even my soul\n  Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,\n  Possess\'d with such a gentle sovereign grace,\n  Of such enchanting presence and discourse,\n  Hath almost made me traitor to myself;\n  But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,\n  I\'ll stop mine ears against the mermaid\'s song.\n\nEnter ANGELO with the chain\n\nANGELO. Master Antipholus!\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Ay, that\'s my name.\nANGELO. I know it well, sir. Lo, here is the chain.\n  I thought to have ta\'en you at the Porpentine;\n  The chain unfinish\'d made me stay thus long.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What is your will that I shall do with\nthis?\nANGELO. What please yourself, sir; I have made it for you.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.\nANGELO. Not once nor twice, but twenty times you have.\n  Go home with it, and please your wife withal;\n  And soon at supper-time I\'ll visit you,\n  And then receive my money for the chain.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I pray you, sir, receive the money now,\n  For fear you ne\'er see chain nor money more.\nANGELO. You are a merry man, sir; fare you well.\n<Exit\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What I should think of this cannot tell:\n  But this I think, there\'s no man is so vain\n  That would refuse so fair an offer\'d chain.\n  I see a man here needs not live by shifts,\n  When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.\n  I\'ll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay;\n  If any ship put out, then straight away.\n<Exit\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

SCENE 1\n\nA public place\n\nEnter SECOND MERCHANT, ANGELO, and an OFFICER\n\nSECOND MERCHANT. You know since Pentecost the sum is due,\n  And since I have not much importun\'d you;\n  Nor now I had not, but that I am bound\n  To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage.\n  Therefore make present satisfaction,\n  Or I\'ll attach you by this officer.\nANGELO. Even just the sum that I do owe to you\n  Is growing to me by Antipholus;\n  And in the instant that I met with you\n  He had of me a chain; at five o\'clock\n  I shall receive the money for the same.\n  Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,\n  I will discharge my bond, and thank you too.\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS, from the\nCOURTEZAN\'S\n\nOFFICER. That labour may you save; see where he comes.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. While I go to the goldsmith\'s house, go\nthou\n  And buy a rope\'s end; that will I bestow\n  Among my wife and her confederates,\n  For locking me out of my doors by day.\n  But, soft, I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;\n  Buy thou a rope, and bring it home to me.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I buy a thousand pound a year; I buy a rope.\n<Exit DROMIO\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS.

Saving your merry humour, here\'s the note\n  How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,\n  The fineness of the gold, and chargeful fashion,\n  Which doth amount to three odd ducats more\n  Than I stand debted to this gentleman.\n  I pray you see him presently discharg\'d,\n  For he is bound to sea, and stays but for it.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I am not furnish\'d with the present money;\n  Besides, I have some business in the town.\n  Good signior, take the stranger to my house,\n  And with you take the chain, and bid my wife\n  Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof.\n  Perchance I will be there as soon as you.\nANGELO. Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; bear it with you, lest I come not time\nenough.\nANGELO. Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;\n  Or else you may return without your money.\nANGELO. Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain;\n  Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,\n  And I, to blame, have held him here too long.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Good Lord! you use this dalliance to\nexcuse\n  Your breach of promise to the Porpentine;\n  I should have chid you for not bringing it,\n  But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.\nSECOND MERCHANT. The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.\nANGELO. You hear how he importunes me-the chain!\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Why, give it to my wife, and fetch your\nmoney.\nANGELO. Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.\n  Either send the chain or send by me some token.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fie, now you run this humour out of\nbreath!\n  Come, where\'s the chain? I pray you let me see it.\nSECOND MERCHANT. My business cannot brook this dalliance.\n  Good sir, say whe\'r you\'ll answer me or no;\n  If not, I\'ll leave him to the officer.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I answer you! What should I answer you?\nANGELO. The money that you owe me for the chain.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I owe you none till I receive the chain.\nANGELO. You know I gave it you half an hour since.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You gave me none; you wrong me much to say\nso.\nANGELO. You wrong me more, sir, in denying it.\n  Consider how it stands upon my credit.\nSECOND MERCHANT. Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.\nOFFICER. I do; and charge you in the Duke\'s name to obey me.\nANGELO. This touches me in reputation.\n  Either consent to pay this sum for me,\n  Or I attach you by this officer.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Consent to pay thee that I never had!\n  Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou dar\'st.\nANGELO. Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer.\n  I would not spare my brother in this case,\n  If he should scorn me so apparently.\nOFFICER. I do arrest you, sir; you hear the suit.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I do obey thee till I give thee bail.\n  But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear\n  As all the metal in your shop will answer.\nANGELO. Sir, sir, I shall have law in Ephesus,\n  To your notorious shame, I doubt it not.\n\nEnter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, from the bay\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, there\'s a bark of Epidamnum\n  That stays but till her owner comes aboard,\n  And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,\n  I have convey\'d aboard; and I have bought\n  The oil, the balsamum, and aqua-vitx.\n  The ship is in her trim; the merry wind\n  Blows fair from land; they stay for nought at an\n  But for their owner, master, and yourself.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. How now! a madman? Why, thou peevish\nsheep,\n  What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. THOU drunken slave! I sent the for a rope;\n  And told thee to what purpose and what end.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. YOU sent me for a rope\'s end as soon-\n  You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I Will debate this matter at more leisure,\n  And teach your ears to list me with more heed.\n  To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight;\n  Give her this key, and tell her in the desk\n  That\'s cover\'d o\'er with Turkish tapestry\n  There is a purse of ducats; let her send it.\n  Tell her I am arrested in the street,\n  And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone.\n  On, officer, to prison till it come.\n<Exeunt all but DROMIO\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. To Adriana! that is where we din\'d,\n  Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband.\n  She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.\n  Thither I must, although against my will,\n  For servants must their masters\' minds fulfil.\n<Exit\n\n\nSCENE 2\n\nThe house of ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS\n\nEnter ADRIANA and LUCIANA\n\nADRIANA. Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?\n  Might\'st thou perceive austerely in his eye\n  That he did plead in earnest? Yea or no?\n  Look\'d he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?\n  What observation mad\'st thou in this case\n  Of his heart\'s meteors tilting in his face?\nLUCIANA. First he denied you had in him no right.\nADRIANA. He meant he did me none-the more my spite.\nLUCIANA. Then swore he that he was a stranger here.\nADRIANA. And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.\nLUCIANA. Then pleaded I for you.\nADRIANA. And what said he?\nLUCIANA. That love I begg\'d for you he begg\'d of me.\nADRIANA. With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?\nLUCIANA. With words that in an honest suit might move.\n  First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.\nADRIANA. Didst speak him fair?\nLUCIANA. Have patience, I beseech.\nADRIANA. I cannot, nor I will not hold me still;\n  My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.\n  He is deformed, crooked, old, and sere,\n  Ill-fac\'d, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;\n  Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;\n  Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.\nLUCIANA. Who would be jealous then of such a one?\n  No evil lost is wail\'d when it is gone.\nADRIANA. Ah, but I think him better than I say,\n  And yet would herein others\' eyes were worse.\n  Far from her nest the lapwing cries away;\n  My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.\n\nEnter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Here go-the desk, the purse. Sweet\n  now, make haste.\nLUCIANA. How hast thou lost thy breath?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. By running fast.\nADRIANA. Where is thy master, Dromio? Is he well?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, he\'s in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.\n  A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;\n  One whose hard heart is button\'d up with steel;\n  A fiend, a fairy, pitiless and rough;\n  A wolf, nay worse, a fellow all in buff;\n  A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that countermands\n  The passages of alleys, creeks, and narrow lands;\n  A hound that runs counter, and yet draws dry-foot well;\n  One that, before the Judgment, carries poor souls to hell.\nADRIANA. Why, man, what is the matter?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I do not know the matter; he is rested on the\ncase.\nADRIANA. What, is he arrested? Tell me, at whose suit?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;\n  But he\'s in a suit of buff which \'rested him, that can I tell.\n  Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?\nADRIANA. Go fetch it, sister.  [Exit LUCIANA]  This I wonder at:\n  Thus he unknown to me should be in debt.\n  Tell me, was he arrested on a band?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. on a band, but on a stronger thing,\n  A chain, a chain. Do you not hear it ring?\nADRIANA. What, the chain?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No, no, the bell; \'tis time that I were gone.\n  It was two ere I left him, and now the clock strikes one.\nADRIANA. The hours come back! That did I never hear.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O yes. If any hour meet a sergeant,\n    \'a turns back for very fear.\nADRIANA. As if Time were in debt! How fondly dost thou reason!\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Time is a very bankrupt, and owes\n    more than he\'s worth to season.\n  Nay, he\'s a thief too: have you not heard men say\n  That Time comes stealing on by night and day?\n  If \'a be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,\n  Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?\n\nRe-enter LUCIANA with a purse\n\nADRIANA. Go, Dromio, there\'s the money; bear it straight,\n  And bring thy master home immediately.\n  Come, sister; I am press\'d down with conceit-\n  Conceit, my comfort and my injury.\n<Exeunt\n\n\nSCENE 3\n\nThe mart\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. There\'s not a man I meet but doth salute\nme\n  As if I were their well-acquainted friend;\n  And every one doth call me by my name.\n  Some tender money to me, some invite me,\n  Some other give me thanks for kindnesses,\n  Some offer me commodities to buy;\n  Even now a tailor call\'d me in his shop,\n  And show\'d me silks that he had bought for me,\n  And therewithal took measure of my body.\n  Sure, these are but imaginary wiles,\n  And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.\n\nEnter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, here\'s the gold you sent me\n  for. What, have you got the picture of old Adam new-apparell\'d?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What gold is this? What Adam dost thou\nmean?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not that Adam that kept the Paradise,\n  but that Adam that keeps the prison; he that goes in the\n  calf\'s skin that was kill\'d for the Prodigal; he that came\nbehind\n  you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you forsake your liberty.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I understand thee not.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. No? Why, \'tis a plain case: he that\n  went, like a bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,\n  that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob, and rest\n  them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed men, and give\n  them suits of durance; he that sets up his rest to do more\n  exploits with his mace than a morris-pike.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. What, thou mean\'st an officer?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band;\n  that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band; on\n  that thinks a man always going to bed, and says \'God give\n  you good rest!\'\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is\n  there any ship puts forth to-night? May we be gone?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Why, sir, I brought you word an\n  hour since that the bark Expedition put forth to-night; and\n  then were you hind\'red by the sergeant, to tarry for the\n  boy Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to deliver\nyou.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. The fellow is distract, and so am I;\n  And here we wander in illusions.\n  Some blessed power deliver us from hence!\n\nEnter a COURTEZAN\n\nCOURTEZAN. Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.\n  I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now.\n  Is that the chain you promis\'d me to-day?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me\nnot.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, is this Mistress Satan?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. It is the devil.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Nay, she is worse, she is the devil\'s\n  dam, and here she comes in the habit of a light wench; and\n  thereof comes that the wenches say \'God damn me!\' That\'s\n  as much to say \'God make me a light wench!\' It is written\n  they appear to men like angels of light; light is an effect\n  of fire, and fire will burn; ergo, light wenches will burn.\n  Come not near her.\nCOURTEZAN. Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.\n  Will you go with me? We\'ll mend our dinner here.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat,\n  or bespeak a long spoon.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Why, Dromio?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Marry, he must have a long spoon\n  that must eat with the devil.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avoid then, fiend! What tell\'st thou me\nof supping?\n  Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress;\n  I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.\nCOURTEZAN. Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,\n  Or, for my diamond, the chain you promis\'d,\n  And I\'ll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Some devils ask but the parings of one\'s\nnail,\n  A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,\n  A nut, a cherry-stone;\n  But she, more covetous, would have a chain.\n  Master, be wise; an if you give it her,\n  The devil will shake her chain, and fright us with it.\nCOURTEZAN. I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain;\n  I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us\ngo.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. \'Fly pride\' says the peacock. Mistress, that\nyou know.\n<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\nCOURTEZAN. Now, out of doubt, Antipholus is mad,\n  Else would he never so demean himself.\n  A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,\n  And for the same he promis\'d me a chain;\n  Both one and other he denies me now.\n  The reason that I gather he is mad,\n  Besides this present instance of his rage,\n  Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner\n  Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.\n  Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,\n  On purpose shut the doors against his way.\n  My way is now to hie home to his house,\n  And tell his wife that, being lunatic,\n  He rush\'d into my house and took perforce\n  My ring away. This course I fittest choose,\n  For forty ducats is too much to lose.\n<Exit\n\n\nSCENE 4\n\nA street\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS with the OFFICER\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Fear me not, man; I will not break away.\n  I\'ll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,\n  To warrant thee, as I am \'rested for.\n  My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,\n  And will not lightly trust the messenger.\n  That I should be attach\'d in Ephesus,\n  I tell you \'twill sound harshly in her cars.\n\nEnter DROMIO OF EPHESUS, with a rope\'s-end\n\n  Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.\n  How now, sir! Have you that I sent you for?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Here\'s that, I warrant you, will pay them all.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. But where\'s the money?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Five hundred ducats, villain, for rope?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I\'ll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. To a rope\'s-end, sir; and to that end am I\n  return\'d.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.\n[Beating him]\nOFFICER. Good sir, be patient.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, \'tis for me to be patient; I am in\n  adversity.\nOFFICER. Good now, hold thy tongue.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou whoreson, senseless villain!\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I would I were senseless, sir, that I\n  might not feel your blows.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou art sensible in nothing but\n  blows, and so is an ass.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I am an ass indeed; you may prove it\n  by my long \'ears. I have served him from the hour of my\n  nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his hands for\n  my service but blows. When I am cold he heats me with\n  beating; when I am warm he cools me with beating. I am\n  wak\'d with it when I sleep; rais\'d with it when I sit; driven\n  out of doors with it when I go from home; welcom\'d home\n  with it when I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders as\n  beggar wont her brat; and I think, when he hath lam\'d me,\n  I shall beg with it from door to door.\n\nEnter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the COURTEZAN, and a SCHOOLMASTER\ncall\'d PINCH\n\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Mistress, \'respice finem,\' respect your end;\nor\n  rather, to prophesy like the parrot, \'Beware the rope\'s-end.\'\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Wilt thou still talk?\n[Beating him]\nCOURTEZAN. How say you now? Is not your husband mad?\nADRIANA. His incivility confirms no less.\n  Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer:\n  Establish him in his true sense again,\n  And I will please you what you will demand.\nLUCIANA. Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!\nCOURTEZAN. Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy.\nPINCH. Give me your hand, and let me feel your pulse.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There is my hand, and let it feel your\near.\n[Striking him]\nPINCH. I charge thee, Satan, hous\'d within this man,\n  To yield possession to my holy prayers,\n  And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight.\n  I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.\nADRIANA. O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. You minion, you, are these your customers?\n  Did this companion with the saffron face\n  Revel and feast it at my house to-day,\n  Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut,\n  And I denied to enter in my house?\nADRIANA. O husband, God doth know you din\'d at home,\n  Where would you had remain\'d until this time,\n  Free from these slanders and this open shame!\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Din\'d at home! Thou villain, what sayest\nthou?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, Sooth to say, you did not dine at home.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Were not my doors lock\'d up and I shut\nout?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Perdie, your doors were lock\'d and you shut\nout.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not she herself revile me there?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sans fable, she herself revil\'d you there.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and\nscorn me?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn\'d\nyou.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And did not I in rage depart from thence?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. In verity, you did. My bones bear witness,\n  That since have felt the vigour of his rage.\nADRIANA. Is\'t good to soothe him in these contraries?\nPINCH. It is no shame; the fellow finds his vein,\n  And, yielding to him, humours well his frenzy.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Thou hast suborn\'d the goldsmith to arrest\nme.\nADRIANA. Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,\n  By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Money by me! Heart and goodwill you might,\n  But surely, master, not a rag of money.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Went\'st not thou to her for purse of\nducats?\nADRIANA. He came to me, and I deliver\'d it.\nLUCIANA. And I am witness with her that she did.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. God and the rope-maker bear me witness\n  That I was sent for nothing but a rope!\nPINCH. Mistress, both man and master is possess\'d;\n  I know it by their pale and deadly looks.\n  They must be bound, and laid in some dark room.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth\nto-day?\n  And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?\nADRIANA. I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. And, gentle master, I receiv\'d no gold;\n  But I confess, sir, that we were lock\'d out.\nADRIANA. Dissembling villain, thou speak\'st false in both.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all,\n  And art confederate with a damned pack\n  To make a loathsome abject scorn of me;\n  But with these nails I\'ll pluck out these false eyes\n  That would behold in me this shameful sport.\nADRIANA. O, bind him, bind him; let him not come near me.\nPINCH. More company! The fiend is strong within him.\n\nEnter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives\n\nLUCIANA. Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler,\nthou,\n  I am thy prisoner. Wilt thou suffer them\n  To make a rescue?\nOFFICER. Masters, let him go;\n  He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.\nPINCH. Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.\n[They bind DROMIO]\nADRIANA. What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?\n  Hast thou delight to see a wretched man\n  Do outrage and displeasure to himself?\nOFFICER. He is my prisoner; if I let him go,\n  The debt he owes will be requir\'d of me.\nADRIANA. I will discharge thee ere I go from thee;\n  Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,\n  And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.\n  Good Master Doctor, see him safe convey\'d\n  Home to my house. O most unhappy day!\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. O most unhappy strumpet!\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Master, I am here ent\'red in bond for you.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Out on thee, villian! Wherefore\n  dost thou mad me?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Will you be bound for nothing?\n  Be mad, good master; cry \'The devil!\'\nLUCIANA. God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!\nADRIANA. Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.\n<Exeunt all but ADRIANA, LUCIANA, OFFICERS, and COURTEZAN\n  Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?\nOFFICER. One Angelo, a goldsmith; do you know him?\nADRIANA. I know the man. What is the sum he owes?\nOFFICER. Two hundred ducats.\nADRIANA. Say, how grows it due?\nOFFICER. Due for a chain your husband had of him.\nADRIANA. He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.\nCOURTEZAN. When as your husband, all in rage, to-day\n  Came to my house, and took away my ring-\n  The ring I saw upon his finger now-\n  Straight after did I meet him with a chain.\nADRIANA. It may be so, but I did never see it.\n  Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is;\n  I long to know the truth hereof at large.\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, with his rapier drawn, and\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE.\n\nLUCIANA. God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.\nADRIANA. And come with naked swords.\n  Let\'s call more help to have them bound again.\nOFFICER. Away, they\'ll kill us!\n<Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE as fast as may be, frighted\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I see these witches are afraid of swords.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. She that would be your wife now ran from you.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from\nthence.\n  I long that we were safe and sound aboard.\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Faith, stay here this night; they will\n  surely do us no harm; you saw they speak us fair, give us\n  gold; methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for\n  the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me,\n  could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.

SCENE 1\n\nA street before a priory\n\nEnter SECOND MERCHANT and ANGELO\n\nANGELO. I am sorry, sir, that I have hind\'red you;\n  But I protest he had the chain of me,\n  Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.\nSECOND MERCHANT. How is the man esteem\'d here in the city?\nANGELO. Of very reverend reputation, sir,\n  Of credit infinite, highly belov\'d,\n  Second to none that lives here in the city;\n  His word might bear my wealth at any time.\nSECOND MERCHANT. Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF SYRACUSE\n\nANGELO. \'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck\n  Which he forswore most monstrously to have.\n  Good sir, draw near to me, I\'ll speak to him.\n  Signior Andpholus, I wonder much\n  That you would put me to this shame and trouble;\n  And, not without some scandal to yourself,\n  With circumstance and oaths so to deny\n  This chain, which now you wear so openly.\n  Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,\n  You have done wrong to this my honest friend;\n  Who, but for staying on our controversy,\n  Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day.\n  This chain you had of me; can you deny it?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think I had; I never did deny it.\nSECOND MERCHANT. Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?\nSECOND MERCHANT. These ears of mine, thou know\'st, did hear thee.\n  Fie on thee, wretch! \'tis pity that thou liv\'st\n  To walk where any honest men resort.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Thou art a villain to impeach me thus;\n  I\'ll prove mine honour and mine honesty\n  Against thee presently, if thou dar\'st stand.\nSECOND MERCHANT.

I am sorry now that I did draw on him.\nABBESS. How long hath this possession held the man?\nADRIANA. This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,\n  And much different from the man he was;\n  But till this afternoon his passion\n  Ne\'er brake into extremity of rage.\nABBESS. Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?\n  Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye\n  Stray\'d his affection in unlawful love?\n  A sin prevailing much in youthful men\n  Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.\n  Which of these sorrows is he subject to?\nADRIANA. To none of these, except it be the last;\n  Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.\nABBESS. You should for that have reprehended him.\nADRIANA. Why, so I did.\nABBESS. Ay, but not rough enough.\nADRIANA. As roughly as my modesty would let me.\nABBESS. Haply in private.\nADRIANA. And in assemblies too.\nABBESS. Ay, but not enough.\nADRIANA. It was the copy of our conference.\n  In bed, he slept not for my urging it;\n  At board, he fed not for my urging it;\n  Alone, it was the subject of my theme;\n  In company, I often glanced it;\n  Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.\nABBESS. And thereof came it that the man was mad.\n  The venom clamours of a jealous woman\n  Poisons more deadly than a mad dog\'s tooth.\n  It seems his sleeps were hind\'red by thy railing,\n  And thereof comes it that his head is light.\n  Thou say\'st his meat was sauc\'d with thy upbraidings:\n  Unquiet meals make ill digestions;\n  Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;\n  And what\'s a fever but a fit of madness?\n  Thou say\'st his sports were hind\'red by thy brawls.\n  Sweet recreation barr\'d, what doth ensue\n  But moody and dull melancholy,\n  Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,\n  And at her heels a huge infectious troop\n  Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?\n  In food, in sport, and life-preserving rest,\n  To be disturb\'d would mad or man or beast.\n  The consequence is, then, thy jealous fits\n  Hath scar\'d thy husband from the use of wits.\nLUCIANA. She never reprehended him but mildly,\n  When he demean\'d himself rough, rude, and wildly.\n  Why bear you these rebukes, and answer not?\nADRIANA. She did betray me to my own reproof.\n  Good people, enter, and lay hold on him.\nABBESS. No, not a creature enters in my house.\nADRIANA. Then let your servants bring my husband forth.\nABBESS. Neither; he took this place for sanctuary,\n  And it shall privilege him from your hands\n  Till I have brought him to his wits again,\n  Or lose my labour in assaying it.\nADRIANA. I will attend my husband, be his nurse,\n  Diet his sickness, for it is my office,\n  And will have no attorney but myself;\n  And therefore let me have him home with me.\nABBESS. Be patient; for I will not let him stir\n  Till I have us\'d the approved means I have,\n  With wholesome syrups, drugs, and holy prayers,\n  To make of him a formal man again.\n  It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,\n  A charitable duty of my order;\n  Therefore depart, and leave him here with me.\nADRIANA. I will not hence and leave my husband here;\n  And ill it doth beseem your holiness\n  To separate the husband and the wife.\nABBESS. Be quiet, and depart; thou shalt not have him.\n<Exit\nLUCIANA. Complain unto the Duke of this indignity.\nADRIANA. Come, go; I will fall prostrate at his feet,\n  And never rise until my tears and prayers\n  Have won his Grace to come in person hither\n  And take perforce my husband from the Abbess.\nSECOND MERCHANT. By this, I think, the dial points at five;\n  Anon, I\'m sure, the Duke himself in person\n  Comes this way to the melancholy vale,\n  The place of death and sorry execution,\n  Behind the ditches of the abbey here.\nANGELO. Upon what cause?\nSECOND MERCHANT. To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,\n  Who put unluckily into this bay\n  Against the laws and statutes of this town,\n  Beheaded publicly for his offence.\nANGELO. See where they come; we will behold his death.\nLUCIANA. Kneel to the Duke before he pass the abbey.\n\nEnter the DUKE, attended; AEGEON, bareheaded;\nwith the HEADSMAN and other OFFICERS\n\nDUKE. Yet once again proclaim it publicly,\n  If any friend will pay the sum for him,\n  He shall not die; so much we tender him.\nADRIANA. Justice, most sacred Duke, against the Abbess!\nDUKE. She is a virtuous and a reverend lady;\n  It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.\nADRIANA. May it please your Grace, Antipholus, my husband,\n  Who I made lord of me and all I had\n  At your important letters-this ill day\n  A most outrageous fit of madness took him,\n  That desp\'rately he hurried through the street,\n  With him his bondman all as mad as he,\n  Doing displeasure to the citizens\n  By rushing in their houses, bearing thence\n  Rings, jewels, anything his rage did like.\n  Once did I get him bound and sent him home,\n  Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,\n  That here and there his fury had committed.\n  Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,\n  He broke from those that had the guard of him,\n  And with his mad attendant and himself,\n  Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,\n  Met us again and, madly bent on us,\n  Chas\'d us away; till, raising of more aid,\n  We came again to bind them. Then they fled\n  Into this abbey, whither we pursu\'d them;\n  And here the Abbess shuts the gates on us,\n  And will not suffer us to fetch him out,\n  Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.\n  Therefore, most gracious Duke, with thy command\n  Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.\nDUKE. Long since thy husband serv\'d me in my wars,\n  And I to thee engag\'d a prince\'s word,\n  When thou didst make him master of thy bed,\n  To do him all the grace and good I could.\n  Go, some of you, knock at the abbey gate,\n  And bid the Lady Abbess come to me,\n  I will determine this before I stir.\n\nEnter a MESSENGER\n\nMESSENGER. O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!\n  My master and his man are both broke loose,\n  Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor,\n  Whose beard they have sing\'d off with brands of fire;\n  And ever, as it blaz\'d, they threw on him\n  Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair.\n  My master preaches patience to him, and the while\n  His man with scissors nicks him like a fool;\n  And sure, unless you send some present help,\n  Between them they will kill the conjurer.\nADRIANA. Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,\n  And that is false thou dost report to us.\nMESSENGER. Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;\n  I have not breath\'d almost since I did see it.\n  He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,\n  To scorch your face, and to disfigure you.\n[Cry within]\n  Hark, hark, I hear him, mistress; fly, be gone!\nDUKE. Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds.\nADRIANA. Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you\n  That he is borne about invisible.\n  Even now we hous\'d him in the abbey here,\n  And now he\'s there, past thought of human reason.\n\nEnter ANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS and DROMIO OFEPHESUS\n\nANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, most gracious Duke; O, grant me\njustice!\n  Even for the service that long since I did thee,\n  When I bestrid thee in the wars, and took\n  Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood\n  That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.\nAEGEON. Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,\n  I see my son Antipholus, and Dromio.\nANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. Justice, sweet Prince, against that woman\nthere!\n  She whom thou gav\'st to me to be my wife,\n  That hath abused and dishonoured me\n  Even in the strength and height of injury.\n  Beyond imagination is the wrong\n  That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.\nDUKE. Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.\nANTIPHOLUS OFEPHESUS. This day, great Duke, she shut the doors\nupon me,\n  While she with harlots feasted in my house.\nDUKE. A grievous fault. Say, woman, didst thou so?\nADRIANA. No, my good lord. Myself, he, and my sister,\n  To-day did dine together. So befall my soul\n  As this is false he burdens me withal!\nLUCIANA. Ne\'er may I look on day nor sleep on night\n  But she tells to your Highness simple truth!\nANGELO. O peflur\'d woman! They are both forsworn.\n  In this the madman justly chargeth them.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. My liege, I am advised what I say;\n  Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,\n  Nor heady-rash, provok\'d with raging ire,\n  Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.\n  This woman lock\'d me out this day from dinner;\n  That goldsmith there, were he not pack\'d with her,\n  Could witness it, for he was with me then;\n  Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,\n  Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,\n  Where Balthazar and I did dine together.\n  Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,\n  I went to seek him. In the street I met him,\n  And in his company that gentleman.\n  There did this perjur\'d goldsmith swear me down\n  That I this day of him receiv\'d the chain,\n  Which, God he knows, I saw not; for the which\n  He did arrest me with an officer.\n  I did obey, and sent my peasant home\n  For certain ducats; he with none return\'d.\n  Then fairly I bespoke the officer\n  To go in person with me to my house.\n  By th\' way we met my wife, her sister, and a rabble more\n  Of vile confederates. Along with them\n  They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-fac\'d villain,\n  A mere anatomy, a mountebank,\n  A threadbare juggler, and a fortune-teller,\n  A needy, hollow-ey\'d, sharp-looking wretch,\n  A living dead man. This pernicious slave,\n  Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,\n  And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,\n  And with no face, as \'twere, outfacing me,\n  Cries out I was possess\'d. Then all together\n  They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence,\n  And in a dark and dankish vault at home\n  There left me and my man, both bound together;\n  Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,\n  I gain\'d my freedom, and immediately\n  Ran hither to your Grace; whom I beseech\n  To give me ample satisfaction\n  For these deep shames and great indignities.\nANGELO. My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,\n  That he din\'d not at home, but was lock\'d out.\nDUKE. But had he such a chain of thee, or no?\nANGELO. He had, my lord, and when he ran in here,\n  These people saw the chain about his neck.\nSECOND MERCHANT. Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine\n  Heard you confess you had the chain of him,\n  After you first forswore it on the mart;\n  And thereupon I drew my sword on you,\n  And then you fled into this abbey here,\n  From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never came within these abbey walls,\n  Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me;\n  I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!\n  And this is false you burden me withal.\nDUKE. Why, what an intricate impeach is this!\n  I think you all have drunk of Circe\'s cup.\n  If here you hous\'d him, here he would have been;\n  If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly.\n  You say he din\'d at home: the goldsmith here\n  Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Sir, he din\'d with her there, at the\nPorpentine.\nCOURTEZAN. He did; and from my finger snatch\'d that ring.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. \'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of\nher.\nDUKE. Saw\'st thou him enter at the abbey here?\nCOURTEZAN. As sure, my liege, as I do see your Grace.\nDUKE. Why, this is strange. Go call the Abbess hither.\n  I think you are all mated or stark mad.\n<Exit one to the ABBESS\nAEGEON. Most mighty Duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:\n  Haply I see a friend will save my life\n  And pay the sum that may deliver me.\nDUKE. Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.\nAEGEON. Is not your name, sir, call\'d Antipholus?\n  And is not that your bondman Dromio?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Within this hour I was his bondman, sir,\n  But he, I thank him, gnaw\'d in two my cords\n  Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.\nAEGEON. I am sure you both of you remember me.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;\n  For lately we were bound as you are now.\n  You are not Pinch\'s patient, are you, sir?\nAEGEON. Why look you strange on me? You know me well.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw you in my life till now.\nAEGEON. O! grief hath chang\'d me since you saw me last;\n  And careful hours with time\'s deformed hand\n  Have written strange defeatures in my face.\n  But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Neither.\nAEGEON. Dromio, nor thou?\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, trust me, sir, nor I.\nAEGEON. I am sure thou dost.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and\n  whatsoever a man denies, you are now bound to believe him.\nAEGEON. Not know my voice! O time\'s extremity,\n  Hast thou so crack\'d and splitted my poor tongue\n  In seven short years that here my only son\n  Knows not my feeble key of untun\'d cares?\n  Though now this grained face of mine be hid\n  In sap-consuming winter\'s drizzled snow,\n  And all the conduits of my blood froze up,\n  Yet hath my night of life some memory,\n  My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,\n  My dull deaf ears a little use to hear;\n  All these old witnesses-I cannot err-\n  Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I never saw my father in my life.\nAEGEON. But seven years since, in Syracuse, boy,\n  Thou know\'st we parted; but perhaps, my son,\n  Thou sham\'st to acknowledge me in misery.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. The Duke and all that know me in\n  the city Can witness with me that it is not so:\n  I ne\'er saw Syracuse in my life.\nDUKE. I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years\n  Have I been patron to Antipholus,\n  During which time he ne\'er saw Syracuse.\n  I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.\n\nRe-enter the ABBESS, with ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and DROMIO OF\nSYRACUSE\n\nABBESS. Most mighty Duke, behold a man much wrong\'d.\n[All gather to see them]\nADRIANA. I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.\nDUKE. One of these men is genius to the other;\n  And so of these. Which is the natural man,\n  And which the spirit? Who deciphers them?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. I, Sir, am Dromio; pray let me stay.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. Aegeon, art thou not? or else his\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. O, my old master! who hath bound\nABBESS. Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds,\n  And gain a husband by his liberty.\n  Speak, old Aegeon, if thou be\'st the man\n  That hadst a wife once call\'d Aemilia,\n  That bore thee at a burden two fair sons.\n  O, if thou be\'st the same Aegeon, speak,\n  And speak unto the same Aemilia!\nAEGEON. If I dream not, thou art Aemilia.\n  If thou art she, tell me where is that son\n  That floated with thee on the fatal raft?\nABBESS. By men of Epidamnum he and I\n  And the twin Dromio, all were taken up;\n  But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth\n  By force took Dromio and my son from them,\n  And me they left with those of Epidamnum.\n  What then became of them I cannot tell;\n  I to this fortune that you see me in.\nDUKE. Why, here begins his morning story right.\n  These two Antipholus\', these two so like,\n  And these two Dromios, one in semblance-\n  Besides her urging of her wreck at sea-\n  These are the parents to these children,\n  Which accidentally are met together.\n  Antipholus, thou cam\'st from Corinth first?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.\nDUKE. Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. I came from Corinth, my most gracious\nlord.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. And I with him.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Brought to this town by that most famous\nwarrior,\n  Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.\nADRIANA. Which of you two did dine with me to-day?\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I, gentle mistress.\nADRIANA. And are not you my husband?\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. No; I say nay to that.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. And so do I, yet did she call me so;\n  And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,\n  Did call me brother.  [To LUCIANA]  What I told you then,\n  I hope I shall have leisure to make good;\n  If this be not a dream I see and hear.\nANGELO. That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. I think it be, sir; I deny it not.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.\nANGELO. I think I did, sir; I deny it not.\nADRIANA. I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,\n  By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. No, none by me.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. This purse of ducats I receiv\'d from you,\n  And Dromio my man did bring them me.\n  I see we still did meet each other\'s man,\n  And I was ta\'en for him, and he for me,\n  And thereupon these ERRORS are arose.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. These ducats pawn I for my father here.\nDUKE. It shall not need; thy father hath his life.\nCOURTEZAN. Sir, I must have that diamond from you.\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. There, take it; and much thanks for my\n  good cheer.\nABBESS. Renowned Duke, vouchsafe to take the pains\n  To go with us into the abbey here,\n  And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes;\n  And all that are assembled in this place\n  That by this sympathized one day\'s error\n  Have suffer\'d wrong, go keep us company,\n  And we shall make full satisfaction.\n  Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail\n  Of you, my sons; and till this present hour\n  My heavy burden ne\'er delivered.\n  The Duke, my husband, and my children both,\n  And you the calendars of their nativity,\n  Go to a gossips\' feast, and go with me;\n  After so long grief, such nativity!\nDUKE. With all my heart, I\'ll gossip at this feast.\n<Exeunt all but ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE, ANTIPHOLUS OF\nEPHESUS, DROMIO OF SYRACUSE, and DROMIO OF EPHESUS\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Master, shall I fetch your stuff from\nshipboard?\nANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS. Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou\nembark\'d?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the\nCentaur.\nANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE. He speaks to me. I am your master,\nDromio.\n  Come, go with us; we\'ll look to that anon.\n  Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.\n<Exeunt ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE and ANTIPHOLUS OF EPHESUS\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. There is a fat friend at your master\'s house,\n  That kitchen\'d me for you to-day at dinner;\n  She now shall be my sister, not my wife.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother;\n  I see by you I am a sweet-fac\'d youth.\n  Will you walk in to see their gossiping?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. Not I, sir; you are my elder.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. That\'s a question; how shall we try it?\nDROMIO OF SYRACUSE. We\'ll draw cuts for the senior; till then,\n    lead thou first.\nDROMIO OF EPHESUS. Nay, then, thus:\n  We came into the world like brother and brother,\n  And now let\'s go hand in hand, not one before another.\n<Exeunt\n\n\nTHE END\n\n\n'

A street\n\nEnter RICHARD, DUKE OF GLOUCESTER, solus\n\n  GLOUCESTER. Now is the winter of our discontent\n    Made glorious summer by this sun of York;\n    And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house\n    In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.\n    Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;\n    Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;\n    Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings,\n    Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.\n    Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front,\n    And now, instead of mounting barbed steeds\n    To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,\n    He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber\n    To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.\n    But I-that am not shap'd for sportive tricks,\n    Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass-\n    I-that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty\n    To strut before a wanton ambling nymph- \n    I-that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,\n    Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,\n    Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time\n    Into this breathing world scarce half made up,\n    And that so lamely and unfashionable\n    That dogs bark at me as I halt by them-\n    Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,\n    Have no delight to pass away the time,\n    Unless to spy my shadow in the sun\n    And descant on mine own deformity.\n    And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover\n    To entertain these fair well-spoken days,\n    I am determined to prove a villain\n    And hate the idle pleasures of these days.\n    Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,\n    By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,\n    To set my brother Clarence and the King\n    In deadly hate the one against the other;\n    And if King Edward be as true and just\n    As I am subtle, false, and treacherous, \n    This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up-\n    About a prophecy which says that G\n    Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\n    Dive, thoughts, down to my soul. Here Clarence comes.\n\n             Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY\n\n    Brother, good day. What means this armed guard\n    That waits upon your Grace?\n  CLARENCE. His Majesty,\n    Tend'ring my person's safety, hath appointed\n    This conduct to convey me to th' Tower.\n  GLOUCESTER. Upon what cause?\n  CLARENCE. Because my name is George.\n  GLOUCESTER. Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours:\n    He should, for that, commit your godfathers.\n    O, belike his Majesty hath some intent\n    That you should be new-christ'ned in the Tower.\n    But what's the matter, Clarence? May I know?\n  CLARENCE. Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest \n    As yet I do not; but, as I can learn,\n    He hearkens after prophecies and dreams,\n    And from the cross-row plucks the letter G,\n    And says a wizard told him that by G\n    His issue disinherited should be;\n    And, for my name of George begins with G,\n    It follows in his thought that I am he.\n    These, as I learn, and such like toys as these\n    Hath mov'd his Highness to commit me now.\n  GLOUCESTER. Why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:\n    'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower;\n    My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she\n    That tempers him to this extremity.\n    Was it not she and that good man of worship,\n    Antony Woodville, her brother there,\n    That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,\n    From whence this present day he is delivered?\n    We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.\n  CLARENCE. By heaven, I think there is no man is secure\n    But the Queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds \n    That trudge betwixt the King and Mistress Shore.\n    Heard you not what an humble suppliant\n    Lord Hastings was, for her delivery?\n  GLOUCESTER. Humbly complaining to her deity\n    Got my Lord Chamberlain his liberty.\n    I'll tell you what-I think it is our way,\n    If we will keep in favour with the King,\n    To be her men and wear her livery:\n    The jealous o'er-worn widow, and herself,\n    Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen,\n    Are mighty gossips in our monarchy.\n  BRAKENBURY. I beseech your Graces both to pardon me:\n    His Majesty hath straitly given in charge\n    That no man shall have private conference,\n    Of what degree soever, with your brother.\n  GLOUCESTER. Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,\n    You may partake of any thing we say:\n    We speak no treason, man; we say the King\n    Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen\n    Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous; \n    We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,\n    A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;\n    And that the Queen's kindred are made gentlefolks.\n    How say you, sir? Can you deny all this?\n  BRAKENBURY. With this, my lord, myself have naught to do.\n  GLOUCESTER. Naught to do with Mistress Shore! I tell thee,\n    fellow,\n    He that doth naught with her, excepting one,\n    Were best to do it secretly alone.\n  BRAKENBURY. What one, my lord?\n  GLOUCESTER. Her husband, knave! Wouldst thou betray me?\n  BRAKENBURY. I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, and\n    withal\n    Forbear your conference with the noble Duke.\n  CLARENCE. We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will\n    obey.\n  GLOUCESTER. We are the Queen's abjects and must obey.\n    Brother, farewell; I will unto the King;\n    And whatsoe'er you will employ me in-\n    Were it to call King Edward's widow sister- \n    I will perform it to enfranchise you.\n    Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood\n    Touches me deeper than you can imagine.\n  CLARENCE. I know it pleaseth neither of us well.\n  GLOUCESTER. Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;\n    I will deliver or else lie for you.\n    Meantime, have patience.\n  CLARENCE. I must perforce. Farewell.\n                          Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and guard\n  GLOUCESTER. Go tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.\n    Simple, plain Clarence, I do love thee so\n    That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,\n    If heaven will take the present at our hands.\n    But who comes here? The new-delivered Hastings?\n\n                       Enter LORD HASTINGS\n\n  HASTINGS. Good time of day unto my gracious lord!\n  GLOUCESTER. As much unto my good Lord Chamberlain!\n    Well are you welcome to the open air. \n    How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?\n  HASTINGS. With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must;\n    But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks\n    That were the cause of my imprisonment.\n  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;\n    For they that were your enemies are his,\n    And have prevail'd as much on him as you.\n  HASTINGS. More pity that the eagles should be mew'd\n    Whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty.\n  GLOUCESTER. What news abroad?\n  HASTINGS. No news so bad abroad as this at home:\n    The King is sickly, weak, and melancholy,\n    And his physicians fear him mightily.\n  GLOUCESTER. Now, by Saint John, that news is bad indeed.\n    O, he hath kept an evil diet long\n    And overmuch consum'd his royal person!\n    'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.\n    Where is he? In his bed?\n  HASTINGS. He is.\n  GLOUCESTER. Go you before, and I will follow you. \n                                                   Exit HASTINGS\n    He cannot live, I hope, and must not die\n    Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven.\n    I'll in to urge his hatred more to Clarence\n    With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;\n    And, if I fail not in my deep intent,\n    Clarence hath not another day to live;\n    Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,\n    And leave the world for me to bustle in!\n    For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.\n    What though I kill'd her husband and her father?\n    The readiest way to make the wench amends\n    Is to become her husband and her father;\n    The which will I-not all so much for love\n    As for another secret close intent\n    By marrying her which I must reach unto.\n    But yet I run before my horse to market.\n    Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns;\n    When they are gone, then must I count my gains.         Exit\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\n\nLondon. Another street\n\nEnter corpse of KING HENRY THE SIXTH, with halberds to guard it;\nLADY ANNE being the mourner, attended by TRESSEL and BERKELEY\n\n  ANNE. Set down, set down your honourable load-\n    If honour may be shrouded in a hearse;\n    Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament\n    Th' untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.\n    Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!\n    Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!\n    Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!\n    Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost\n    To hear the lamentations of poor Anne,\n    Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtered son,\n    Stabb'd by the self-same hand that made these wounds.\n    Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life\n    I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.\n    O, cursed be the hand that made these holes!\n    Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it! \n    Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!\n    More direful hap betide that hated wretch\n    That makes us wretched by the death of thee\n    Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,\n    Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!\n    If ever he have child, abortive be it,\n    Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,\n    Whose ugly and unnatural aspect\n    May fright the hopeful mother at the view,\n    And that be heir to his unhappiness!\n    If ever he have wife, let her be made\n    More miserable by the death of him\n    Than I am made by my young lord and thee!\n    Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,\n    Taken from Paul's to be interred there;\n    And still as you are weary of this weight\n    Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.\n                                [The bearers take up the coffin]\n\n                      Enter GLOUCESTER \n\n  GLOUCESTER. Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.\n  ANNE. What black magician conjures up this fiend\n    To stop devoted charitable deeds?\n  GLOUCESTER. Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,\n    I'll make a corse of him that disobeys!\n  FIRST GENTLEMAN. My lord, stand back, and let the coffin\n    pass.\n  GLOUCESTER. Unmannerd dog! Stand thou, when I command.\n    Advance thy halberd higher than my breast,\n    Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot\n    And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.\n                               [The bearers set down the coffin]\n  ANNE. What, do you tremble? Are you all afraid?\n    Alas, I blame you not, for you are mortal,\n    And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.\n    Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!\n    Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,\n    His soul thou canst not have; therefore, be gone.\n  GLOUCESTER. Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst. \n  ANNE. Foul devil, for God's sake, hence and trouble us not;\n    For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell\n    Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.\n    If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,\n    Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.\n    O, gentlemen, see, see! Dead Henry's wounds\n    Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh.\n    Blush, blush, thou lump of foul deformity,\n    For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood\n    From cold and empty veins where no blood dwells;\n    Thy deeds inhuman and unnatural\n    Provokes this deluge most unnatural.\n    O God, which this blood mad'st, revenge his death!\n    O earth, which this blood drink'st, revenge his death!\n    Either, heav'n, with lightning strike the murd'rer dead;\n    Or, earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,\n    As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood,\n    Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered.\n  GLOUCESTER. Lady, you know no rules of charity,\n    Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses. \n  ANNE. Villain, thou knowest nor law of God nor man:\n    No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.\n  GLOUCESTER. But I know none, and therefore am no beast.\n  ANNE. O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!\n  GLOUCESTER. More wonderful when angels are so angry.\n    Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,\n    Of these supposed crimes to give me leave\n    By circumstance but to acquit myself.\n  ANNE. Vouchsafe, diffus'd infection of a man,\n    Of these known evils but to give me leave\n    By circumstance to accuse thy cursed self.\n  GLOUCESTER. Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have\n    Some patient leisure to excuse myself.\n  ANNE. Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make\n    No excuse current but to hang thyself.\n  GLOUCESTER. By such despair I should accuse myself.\n  ANNE. And by despairing shalt thou stand excused\n    For doing worthy vengeance on thyself\n    That didst unworthy slaughter upon others.\n  GLOUCESTER. Say that I slew them not? \n  ANNE. Then say they were not slain.\n    But dead they are, and, devilish slave, by thee.\n  GLOUCESTER. I did not kill your husband.\n  ANNE. Why, then he is alive.\n  GLOUCESTER. Nay, he is dead, and slain by Edward's hands.\n  ANNE. In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw\n    Thy murd'rous falchion smoking in his blood;\n    The which thou once didst bend against her breast,\n    But that thy brothers beat aside the point.\n  GLOUCESTER. I was provoked by her sland'rous tongue\n    That laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.\n  ANNE. Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind,\n    That never dream'st on aught but butcheries.\n    Didst thou not kill this king?\n  GLOUCESTER. I grant ye.\n  ANNE. Dost grant me, hedgehog? Then, God grant me to\n    Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!\n    O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!\n  GLOUCESTER. The better for the King of Heaven, that hath\n    him. \n  ANNE. He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.\n  GLOUCESTER. Let him thank me that holp to send him\n    thither,\n    For he was fitter for that place than earth.\n  ANNE. And thou unfit for any place but hell.\n  GLOUCESTER. Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.\n  ANNE. Some dungeon.\n  GLOUCESTER. Your bed-chamber.\n  ANNE. Ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest!\n  GLOUCESTER. So will it, madam, till I lie with you.\n  ANNE. I hope so.\n  GLOUCESTER. I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,\n    To leave this keen encounter of our wits,\n    And fall something into a slower method-\n    Is not the causer of the timeless deaths\n    Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,\n    As blameful as the executioner?\n  ANNE. Thou wast the cause and most accurs'd effect.\n  GLOUCESTER. Your beauty was the cause of that effect-\n    Your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep \n    To undertake the death of all the world\n    So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.\n  ANNE. If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,\n    These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.\n  GLOUCESTER. These eyes could not endure that beauty's\n    wreck;\n    You should not blemish it if I stood by.\n    As all the world is cheered by the sun,\n    So I by that; it is my day, my life.\n  ANNE. Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!\n  GLOUCESTER. Curse not thyself, fair creature; thou art both.\n  ANNE. I would I were, to be reveng'd on thee.\n  GLOUCESTER. It is a quarrel most unnatural,\n    To be reveng'd on him that loveth thee.\n  ANNE. It is a quarrel just and reasonable,\n    To be reveng'd on him that kill'd my husband.\n  GLOUCESTER. He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband\n    Did it to help thee to a better husband.\n  ANNE. His better doth not breathe upon the earth.\n  GLOUCESTER. He lives that loves thee better than he could. \n  ANNE. Name him.\n  GLOUCESTER. Plantagenet.\n  ANNE. Why, that was he.\n  GLOUCESTER. The self-same name, but one of better nature.\n  ANNE. Where is he?\n  GLOUCESTER. Here.  [She spits at him]  Why dost thou spit\n    at me?\n  ANNE. Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!\n  GLOUCESTER. Never came poison from so sweet a place.\n  ANNE. Never hung poison on a fouler toad.\n    Out of my sight! Thou dost infect mine eyes.\n  GLOUCESTER. Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.\n  ANNE. Would they were basilisks to strike thee dead!\n  GLOUCESTER. I would they were, that I might die at once;\n    For now they kill me with a living death.\n    Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,\n    Sham'd their aspects with store of childish drops-\n    These eyes, which never shed remorseful tear,\n    No, when my father York and Edward wept\n    To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made \n    When black-fac'd Clifford shook his sword at him;\n    Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,\n    Told the sad story of my father's death,\n    And twenty times made pause to sob and weep\n    That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks\n    Like trees bedash'd with rain-in that sad time\n    My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;\n    And what these sorrows could not thence exhale\n    Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.\n    I never sued to friend nor enemy;\n    My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;\n    But, now thy beauty is propos'd my fee,\n    My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.\n                                   [She looks scornfully at him]\n    Teach not thy lip such scorn; for it was made\n    For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.\n    If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,\n    Lo here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;\n    Which if thou please to hide in this true breast\n    And let the soul forth that adoreth thee, \n    I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,\n    And humbly beg the death upon my knee.\n      [He lays his breast open; she offers at it with his sword]\n    Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry-\n    But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.\n    Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward-\n    But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.\n                                           [She falls the sword]\n    Take up the sword again, or take up me.\n  ANNE. Arise, dissembler; though I wish thy death,\n    I will not be thy executioner.\n  GLOUCESTER. Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it;\n  ANNE. I have already.\n  GLOUCESTER. That was in thy rage.\n    Speak it again, and even with the word\n    This hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,\n    Shall for thy love kill a far truer love;\n    To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary.\n  ANNE. I would I knew thy heart.\n  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis figur'd in my tongue. \n  ANNE. I fear me both are false.\n  GLOUCESTER. Then never was man true.\n  ANNE. well put up your sword.\n  GLOUCESTER. Say, then, my peace is made.\n  ANNE. That shalt thou know hereafter.\n  GLOUCESTER. But shall I live in hope?\n  ANNE. All men, I hope, live so.\n  GLOUCESTER. Vouchsafe to wear this ring.\n  ANNE. To take is not to give.               [Puts on the ring]\n  GLOUCESTER. Look how my ring encompasseth thy finger,\n    Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;\n    Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.\n    And if thy poor devoted servant may\n    But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,\n    Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.\n  ANNE. What is it?\n  GLOUCESTER. That it may please you leave these sad designs\n    To him that hath most cause to be a mourner,\n    And presently repair to Crosby House;\n    Where-after I have solemnly interr'd \n    At Chertsey monast'ry this noble king,\n    And wet his grave with my repentant tears-\n    I will with all expedient duty see you.\n    For divers unknown reasons, I beseech you,\n    Grant me this boon.\n  ANNE. With all my heart; and much it joys me too\n    To see you are become so penitent.\n    Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.\n  GLOUCESTER. Bid me farewell.\n  ANNE. 'Tis more than you deserve;\n    But since you teach me how to flatter you,\n    Imagine I have said farewell already.\n                             Exeunt two GENTLEMEN With LADY ANNE\n  GLOUCESTER. Sirs, take up the corse.\n  GENTLEMEN. Towards Chertsey, noble lord?\n  GLOUCESTER. No, to White Friars; there attend my coming.\n                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER\n    Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?\n    Was ever woman in this humour won?\n    I'll have her; but I will not keep her long. \n    What! I that kill'd her husband and his father-\n    To take her in her heart's extremest hate,\n    With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,\n    The bleeding witness of my hatred by;\n    Having God, her conscience, and these bars against me,\n    And I no friends to back my suit at all\n    But the plain devil and dissembling looks,\n    And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!\n    Ha!\n    Hath she forgot already that brave prince,\n    Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,\n    Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?\n    A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman-\n    Fram'd in the prodigality of nature,\n    Young, valiant, wise, and no doubt right royal-\n    The spacious world cannot again afford;\n    And will she yet abase her eyes on me,\n    That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince\n    And made her widow to a woeful bed?\n    On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety? \n    On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?\n    My dukedom to a beggarly denier,\n    I do mistake my person all this while.\n    Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,\n    Myself to be a marv'llous proper man.\n    I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,\n    And entertain a score or two of tailors\n    To study fashions to adorn my body.\n    Since I am crept in favour with myself,\n    I will maintain it with some little cost.\n    But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave,\n    And then return lamenting to my love.\n    Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,\n    That I may see my shadow as I pass.                     Exit\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\n\nLondon. The palace\n\nEnter QUEEN ELIZABETH, LORD RIVERS, and LORD GREY\n\n  RIVERS. Have patience, madam; there's no doubt his Majesty\n    Will soon recover his accustom'd health.\n  GREY. In that you brook it ill, it makes him worse;\n    Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,\n    And cheer his Grace with quick and merry eyes.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. If he were dead, what would betide on\n    me?\n  GREY. No other harm but loss of such a lord.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The loss of such a lord includes all\n    harms.\n  GREY. The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son\n    To be your comforter when he is gone.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, he is young; and his minority\n    Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,\n    A man that loves not me, nor none of you.\n  RIVER. Is it concluded he shall be Protector? \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. It is determin'd, not concluded yet;\n    But so it must be, if the King miscarry.\n\n                     Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY\n\n  GREY. Here come the Lords of Buckingham and Derby.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Good time of day unto your royal Grace!\n  DERBY. God make your Majesty joyful as you have been.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Countess Richmond, good my Lord\n    of Derby,\n    To your good prayer will scarcely say amen.\n    Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife\n    And loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd\n    I hate not you for her proud arrogance.\n  DERBY. I do beseech you, either not believe\n    The envious slanders of her false accusers;\n    Or, if she be accus'd on true report,\n    Bear with her weakness, which I think proceeds\n    From wayward sickness and no grounded malice.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Saw you the King to-day, my Lord of \n    Derby?\n  DERBY. But now the Duke of Buckingham and I\n    Are come from visiting his Majesty.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What likelihood of his amendment,\n    Lords?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Madam, good hope; his Grace speaks\n    cheerfully.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God grant him health! Did you confer\n    with him?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Ay, madam; he desires to make atonement\n    Between the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,\n    And between them and my Lord Chamberlain;\n    And sent to warn them to his royal presence.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Would all were well! But that will\n    never be.\n    I fear our happiness is at the height.\n\n              Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET\n\n  GLOUCESTER. They do me wrong, and I will not endure it. \n    Who is it that complains unto the King\n    That I, forsooth, am stern and love them not?\n    By holy Paul, they love his Grace but lightly\n    That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.\n    Because I cannot flatter and look fair,\n    Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive, and cog,\n    Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,\n    I must be held a rancorous enemy.\n    Cannot a plain man live and think no harm\n    But thus his simple truth must be abus'd\n    With silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?\n  GREY. To who in all this presence speaks your Grace?\n  GLOUCESTER. To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.\n    When have I injur'd thee? when done thee wrong,\n    Or thee, or thee, or any of your faction?\n    A plague upon you all! His royal Grace-\n    Whom God preserve better than you would wish!-\n    Cannot be quiet searce a breathing while\n    But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the \n    matter.\n    The King, on his own royal disposition\n    And not provok'd by any suitor else-\n    Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred\n    That in your outward action shows itself\n    Against my children, brothers, and myself-\n    Makes him to send that he may learn the ground.\n  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell; the world is grown so bad\n    That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch.\n    Since every Jack became a gentleman,\n    There's many a gentle person made a Jack.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, we know your meaning,\n    brother Gloucester:\n    You envy my advancement and my friends';\n    God grant we never may have need of you!\n  GLOUCESTER. Meantime, God grants that I have need of you.\n    Our brother is imprison'd by your means,\n    Myself disgrac'd, and the nobility\n    Held in contempt; while great promotions\n    Are daily given to ennoble those \n    That scarce some two days since were worth a noble.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By Him that rais'd me to this careful\n    height\n    From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,\n    I never did incense his Majesty\n    Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been\n    An earnest advocate to plead for him.\n    My lord, you do me shameful injury\n    Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.\n  GLOUCESTER. You may deny that you were not the mean\n    Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.\n  RIVERS. She may, my lord; for-\n  GLOUCESTER. She may, Lord Rivers? Why, who knows\n    not so?\n    She may do more, sir, than denying that:\n    She may help you to many fair preferments\n    And then deny her aiding hand therein,\n    And lay those honours on your high desert.\n    What may she not? She may-ay, marry, may she-\n  RIVERS. What, marry, may she? \n  GLOUCESTER. What, marry, may she? Marry with a king,\n    A bachelor, and a handsome stripling too.\n    Iwis your grandam had a worser match.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long\n    borne\n    Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs.\n    By heaven, I will acquaint his Majesty\n    Of those gross taunts that oft I have endur'd.\n    I had rather be a country servant-maid\n    Than a great queen with this condition-\n    To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at.\n\n                Enter old QUEEN MARGARET, behind\n\n    Small joy have I in being England's Queen.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. And less'ned be that small, God, I\n    beseech Him!\n    Thy honour, state, and seat, is due to me.\n  GLOUCESTER. What! Threat you me with telling of the\n    King? \n    Tell him and spare not. Look what I have said\n    I will avouch't in presence of the King.\n    I dare adventure to be sent to th' Tow'r.\n    'Tis time to speak-my pains are quite forgot.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Out, devil! I do remember them to\n    well:\n    Thou kill'dst my husband Henry in the Tower,\n    And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.\n  GLOUCESTER. Ere you were queen, ay, or your husband\n    King,\n    I was a pack-horse in his great affairs,\n    A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,\n    A liberal rewarder of his friends;\n    To royalize his blood I spent mine own.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Ay, and much better blood than his or\n    thine.\n  GLOUCESTER. In all which time you and your husband Grey\n    Were factious for the house of Lancaster;\n    And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband\n    In Margaret's battle at Saint Albans slain? \n    Let me put in your minds, if you forget,\n    What you have been ere this, and what you are;\n    Withal, what I have been, and what I am.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. A murd'rous villain, and so still thou art.\n  GLOUCESTER. Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick,\n    Ay, and forswore himself-which Jesu pardon!-\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Which God revenge!\n  GLOUCESTER. To fight on Edward's party for the crown;\n    And for his meed, poor lord, he is mewed up.\n    I would to God my heart were flint like Edward's,\n    Or Edward's soft and pitiful like mine.\n    I am too childish-foolish for this world.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Hie thee to hell for shame and leave this\n    world,\n    Thou cacodemon; there thy kingdom is.\n  RIVERS. My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days\n    Which here you urge to prove us enemies,\n    We follow'd then our lord, our sovereign king.\n    So should we you, if you should be our king.\n  GLOUCESTER. If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar. \n    Far be it from my heart, the thought thereof!\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As little joy, my lord, as you suppose\n    You should enjoy were you this country's king,\n    As little joy you may suppose in me\n    That I enjoy, being the Queen thereof.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. As little joy enjoys the Queen thereof;\n    For I am she, and altogether joyless.\n    I can no longer hold me patient.                 [Advancing]\n    Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out\n    In sharing that which you have pill'd from me.\n    Which of you trembles not that looks on me?\n    If not that, I am Queen, you bow like subjects,\n    Yet that, by you depos'd, you quake like rebels?\n    Ah, gentle villain, do not turn away!\n  GLOUCESTER. Foul wrinkled witch, what mak'st thou in my\n    sight?\n  QUEEN MARGARET. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd,\n    That will I make before I let thee go.\n  GLOUCESTER. Wert thou not banished on pain of death?\n  QUEEN MARGARET. I was; but I do find more pain in \n    banishment\n    Than death can yield me here by my abode.\n    A husband and a son thou ow'st to me;\n    And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance.\n    This sorrow that I have by right is yours;\n    And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.\n  GLOUCESTER. The curse my noble father laid on thee,\n    When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper\n    And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,\n    And then to dry them gav'st the Duke a clout\n    Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland-\n    His curses then from bitterness of soul\n    Denounc'd against thee are all fall'n upon thee;\n    And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. So just is God to right the innocent.\n  HASTINGS. O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,\n    And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!\n  RIVERS. Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.\n  DORSET. No man but prophesied revenge for it.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Northumberland, then present, wept to see it. \n  QUEEN MARGARET. What, were you snarling all before I came,\n    Ready to catch each other by the throat,\n    And turn you all your hatred now on me?\n    Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven\n    That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,\n    Their kingdom's loss, my woeful banishment,\n    Should all but answer for that peevish brat?\n    Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?\n    Why then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!\n    Though not by war, by surfeit die your king,\n    As ours by murder, to make him a king!\n    Edward thy son, that now is Prince of Wales,\n    For Edward our son, that was Prince of Wales,\n    Die in his youth by like untimely violence!\n    Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,\n    Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!\n    Long mayest thou live to wail thy children's death,\n    And see another, as I see thee now,\n    Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!\n    Long die thy happy days before thy death; \n    And, after many length'ned hours of grief,\n    Die neither mother, wife, nor England's Queen!\n    Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,\n    And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son\n    Was stabb'd with bloody daggers. God, I pray him,\n    That none of you may live his natural age,\n    But by some unlook'd accident cut off!\n  GLOUCESTER. Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd\n    hag.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. And leave out thee? Stay, dog, for thou\n    shalt hear me.\n    If heaven have any grievous plague in store\n    Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,\n    O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,\n    And then hurl down their indignation\n    On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!\n    The worm of conscience still be-gnaw thy soul!\n    Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv'st,\n    And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!\n    No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine, \n    Unless it be while some tormenting dream\n    Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!\n    Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog,\n    Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity\n    The slave of nature and the son of hell,\n    Thou slander of thy heavy mother's womb,\n    Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins,\n    Thou rag of honour, thou detested-\n  GLOUCESTER. Margaret!\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Richard!\n  GLOUCESTER. Ha?\n  QUEEN MARGARET. I call thee not.\n  GLOUCESTER. I cry thee mercy then, for I did think\n    That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Why, so I did, but look'd for no reply.\n    O, let me make the period to my curse!\n  GLOUCESTER. 'Tis done by me, and ends in-Margaret.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thus have you breath'd your curse\n    against yourself.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my \n    fortune!\n    Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider\n    Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?\n    Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.\n    The day will come that thou shalt wish for me\n    To help thee curse this poisonous bunch-back'd toad.\n  HASTINGS. False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,\n    Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Foul shame upon you! you have all\n    mov'd mine.\n  RIVERS. Were you well serv'd, you would be taught your\n      duty.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. To serve me well you all should do me\n    duty,\n    Teach me to be your queen and you my subjects.\n    O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!\n  DORSET. Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Peace, Master Marquis, you are malapert;\n    Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.\n    O, that your young nobility could judge \n    What 'twere to lose it and be miserable!\n    They that stand high have many blasts to shake them,\n    And if they fall they dash themselves to pieces.\n  GLOUCESTER. Good counsel, marry; learn it, learn it, Marquis.\n  DORSET. It touches you, my lord, as much as me.\n  GLOUCESTER. Ay, and much more; but I was born so high,\n    Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,\n    And dallies with the wind, and scorns the sun.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. And turns the sun to shade-alas! alas!\n    Witness my son, now in the shade of death,\n    Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath\n    Hath in eternal darkness folded up.\n    Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.\n    O God that seest it, do not suffer it;\n    As it is won with blood, lost be it so!\n  BUCKINGHAM. Peace, peace, for shame, if not for charity!\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Urge neither charity nor shame to me.\n    Uncharitably with me have you dealt,\n    And shamefully my hopes by you are butcher'd.\n    My charity is outrage, life my shame; \n    And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage!\n  BUCKINGHAM. Have done, have done.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. O princely Buckingham, I'll kiss thy\n    hand\n    In sign of league and amity with thee.\n    Now fair befall thee and thy noble house!\n    Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,\n    Nor thou within the compass of my curse.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Nor no one here; for curses never pass\n    The lips of those that breathe them in the air.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. I will not think but they ascend the sky\n    And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.\n    O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!\n    Look when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,\n    His venom tooth will rankle to the death:\n    Have not to do with him, beware of him;\n    Sin, death, and hell, have set their marks on him,\n    And all their ministers attend on him.\n  GLOUCESTER. What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord. \n  QUEEN MARGARET. What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle\n    counsel,\n    And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?\n    O, but remember this another day,\n    When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,\n    And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!\n    Live each of you the subjects to his hate,\n    And he to yours, and all of you to God's!               Exit\n  BUCKINGHAM. My hair doth stand an end to hear her curses.\n  RIVERS. And so doth mine. I muse why she's at liberty.\n  GLOUCESTER. I cannot blame her; by God's holy Mother,\n    She hath had too much wrong; and I repent\n    My part thereof that I have done to her.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I never did her any to my knowledge.\n  GLOUCESTER. Yet you have all the vantage of her wrong.\n    I was too hot to do somebody good\n    That is too cold in thinking of it now.\n    Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid;\n    He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains;\n    God pardon them that are the cause thereof! \n  RIVERS. A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,\n    To pray for them that have done scathe to us!\n  GLOUCESTER. So do I ever-  [Aside]  being well advis'd;\n    For had I curs'd now, I had curs'd myself.\n\n                         Enter CATESBY\n\n  CATESBY. Madam, his Majesty doth can for you,\n    And for your Grace, and you, my gracious lords.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Catesby, I come. Lords, will you go\n    with me?\n  RIVERS. We wait upon your Grace.\n                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER\n  GLOUCESTER. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.\n    The secret mischiefs that I set abroach\n    I lay unto the grievous charge of others.\n    Clarence, who I indeed have cast in darkness,\n    I do beweep to many simple gulls;\n    Namely, to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham;\n    And tell them 'tis the Queen and her allies \n    That stir the King against the Duke my brother.\n    Now they believe it, and withal whet me\n    To be reveng'd on Rivers, Dorset, Grey;\n    But then I sigh and, with a piece of Scripture,\n    Tell them that God bids us do good for evil.\n    And thus I clothe my naked villainy\n    With odd old ends stol'n forth of holy writ,\n    And seem a saint when most I play the devil.\n\n                       Enter two MURDERERS\n\n    But, soft, here come my executioners.\n    How now, my hardy stout resolved mates!\n    Are you now going to dispatch this thing?\n  FIRST MURDERER. We are, my lord, and come to have the\n    warrant,\n    That we may be admitted where he is.\n  GLOUCESTER. Well thought upon; I have it here about me.\n                                             [Gives the warrant]\n    When you have done, repair to Crosby Place. \n    But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,\n    Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;\n    For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps\n    May move your hearts to pity, if you mark him.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Tut, tut, my lord, we will not stand to\n    prate;\n    Talkers are no good doers. Be assur'd\n    We go to use our hands and not our tongues.\n  GLOUCESTER. Your eyes drop millstones when fools' eyes fall\n    tears.\n    I like you, lads; about your business straight;\n    Go, go, dispatch.\n  FIRST MURDERER. We will, my noble lord.                 Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4.\n\nLondon. The Tower\n\nEnter CLARENCE and KEEPER\n\n  KEEPER. Why looks your Grace so heavily to-day?\n  CLARENCE. O, I have pass'd a miserable night,\n    So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,\n    That, as I am a Christian faithful man,\n    I would not spend another such a night\n    Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days-\n    So full of dismal terror was the time!\n  KEEPER. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you\n    tell me.\n  CLARENCE. Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower\n    And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;\n    And in my company my brother Gloucester,\n    Who from my cabin tempted me to walk\n    Upon the hatches. Thence we look'd toward England,\n    And cited up a thousand heavy times,\n    During the wars of York and Lancaster,\n    That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along \n    Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\n    Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling\n    Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard\n    Into the tumbling billows of the main.\n    O Lord, methought what pain it was to drown,\n    What dreadful noise of waters in my ears,\n    What sights of ugly death within my eyes!\n    Methoughts I saw a thousand fearful wrecks,\n    A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon,\n    Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\n    Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\n    All scatt'red in the bottom of the sea;\n    Some lay in dead men's skulls, and in the holes\n    Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept,\n    As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\n    That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep\n    And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatt'red by.\n  KEEPER. Had you such leisure in the time of death\n    To gaze upon these secrets of the deep?\n  CLARENCE. Methought I had; and often did I strive \n    To yield the ghost, but still the envious flood\n    Stopp'd in my soul and would not let it forth\n    To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring air;\n    But smother'd it within my panting bulk,\n    Who almost burst to belch it in the sea.\n  KEEPER. Awak'd you not in this sore agony?\n  CLARENCE. No, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life.\n    O, then began the tempest to my soul!\n    I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood\n    With that sour ferryman which poets write of,\n    Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\n    The first that there did greet my stranger soul\n    Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,\n    Who spake aloud 'What scourge for perjury\n    Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'\n    And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by\n    A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\n    Dabbled in blood, and he shriek'd out aloud\n    'Clarence is come-false, fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,\n    That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury. \n    Seize on him, Furies, take him unto torment!'\n    With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\n    Environ'd me, and howled in mine ears\n    Such hideous cries that, with the very noise,\n    I trembling wak'd, and for a season after\n    Could not believe but that I was in hell,\n    Such terrible impression made my dream.\n  KEEPER. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;\n    I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.\n  CLARENCE. Ah, Keeper, Keeper, I have done these things\n    That now give evidence against my soul\n    For Edward's sake, and see how he requites me!\n    O God! If my deep prayers cannot appease Thee,\n    But Thou wilt be aveng'd on my misdeeds,\n    Yet execute Thy wrath in me alone;\n    O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\n  KEEPER, I prithee sit by me awhile;\n    My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\n  KEEPER. I will, my lord. God give your Grace good rest.\n                                               [CLARENCE sleeps] \n\n                  Enter BRAKENBURY the Lieutenant\n\n  BRAKENBURY. Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\n    Makes the night morning and the noontide night.\n    Princes have but their titles for their glories,\n    An outward honour for an inward toil;\n    And for unfelt imaginations\n    They often feel a world of restless cares,\n    So that between their tides and low name\n    There's nothing differs but the outward fame.\n\n                      Enter the two MURDERERS\n\n  FIRST MURDERER. Ho! who's here?\n  BRAKENBURY. What wouldst thou, fellow, and how cam'st\n    thou hither?\n  FIRST MURDERER. I would speak with Clarence, and I came\n    hither on my legs.\n  BRAKENBURY. What, so brief? \n  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis better, sir, than to be tedious. Let\n    him see our commission and talk no more.\n                                           [BRAKENBURY reads it]\n  BRAKENBURY. I am, in this, commanded to deliver\n    The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands.\n    I will not reason what is meant hereby,\n    Because I will be guiltless from the meaning.\n    There lies the Duke asleep; and there the keys.\n    I'll to the King and signify to him\n    That thus I have resign'd to you my charge.\n  FIRST MURDERER. You may, sir; 'tis a point of wisdom. Fare\n    you well.                       Exeunt BRAKENBURY and KEEPER\n  SECOND MURDERER. What, shall I stab him as he sleeps?\n  FIRST MURDERER. No; he'll say 'twas done cowardly, when\n    he wakes.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Why, he shall never wake until the great\n    judgment-day.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Why, then he'll say we stabb'd him\n    sleeping.\n  SECOND MURDERER. The urging of that word judgment hath \n    bred a kind of remorse in me.\n  FIRST MURDERER. What, art thou afraid?\n  SECOND MURDERER. Not to kill him, having a warrant; but to\n    be damn'd for killing him, from the which no warrant can\n    defend me.\n  FIRST MURDERER. I thought thou hadst been resolute.\n  SECOND MURDERER. So I am, to let him live.\n  FIRST MURDERER. I'll back to the Duke of Gloucester and\n    tell him so.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Nay, I prithee, stay a little. I hope this\n    passionate humour of mine will change; it was wont to\n    hold me but while one tells twenty.\n  FIRST MURDERER. How dost thou feel thyself now?\n    SECOND MURDERER. Faith, some certain dregs of conscience\n    are yet within me.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Remember our reward, when the deed's\n    done.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Zounds, he dies; I had forgot the reward.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Where's thy conscience now?\n  SECOND MURDERER. O, in the Duke of Gloucester's purse! \n  FIRST MURDERER. When he opens his purse to give us our\n    reward, thy conscience flies out.\n  SECOND MURDERER. 'Tis no matter; let it go; there's few or\n    none will entertain it.\n  FIRST MURDERER. What if it come to thee again?\n  SECOND MURDERER. I'll not meddle with it-it makes a man\n    coward: a man cannot steal, but it accuseth him; a man\n    cannot swear, but it checks him; a man cannot lie with his\n    neighbour's wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shame-\n    fac'd spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills a man\n    full of obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold\n    that-by chance I found. It beggars any man that keeps it.\n    It is turn'd out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing;\n    and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust\n    to himself and live without it.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Zounds, 'tis even now at my elbow,\n    persuading me not to kill the Duke.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Take the devil in thy mind and believe\n    him not; he would insinuate with thee but to make the\n    sigh. \n  FIRST MURDERER. I am strong-fram'd; he cannot prevail with\n    me.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Spoke like a tall man that respects thy\n    reputation. Come, shall we fall to work?\n  FIRST MURDERER. Take him on the costard with the hilts of\n    thy sword, and then chop him in the malmsey-butt in the\n    next room.\n  SECOND MURDERER. O excellent device! and make a sop of\n    him.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Soft! he wakes.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Strike!\n  FIRST MURDERER. No, we'll reason with him.\n  CLARENCE. Where art thou, Keeper? Give me a cup of wine.\n  SECOND MURDERER. You shall have wine enough, my lord,\n    anon.\n  CLARENCE. In God's name, what art thou?\n  FIRST MURDERER. A man, as you are.\n  CLARENCE. But not as I am, royal.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Nor you as we are, loyal.\n  CLARENCE. Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble. \n  FIRST MURDERER. My voice is now the King's, my looks\n    mine own.\n  CLARENCE. How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!\n    Your eyes do menace me. Why look you pale?\n    Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?\n  SECOND MURDERER. To, to, to-\n  CLARENCE. To murder me?\n  BOTH MURDERERS. Ay, ay.\n  CLARENCE. You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,\n    And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.\n    Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?\n  FIRST MURDERER. Offended us you have not, but the King.\n  CLARENCE. I shall be reconcil'd to him again.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.\n  CLARENCE. Are you drawn forth among a world of men\n    To slay the innocent? What is my offence?\n    Where is the evidence that doth accuse me?\n    What lawful quest have given their verdict up\n    Unto the frowning judge, or who pronounc'd\n    The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death? \n    Before I be convict by course of law,\n    To threaten me with death is most unlawful.\n    I charge you, as you hope to have redemption\n    By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,\n    That you depart and lay no hands on me.\n    The deed you undertake is damnable.\n  FIRST MURDERER. What we will do, we do upon command.\n  SECOND MURDERER. And he that hath commanded is our\n    King.\n  CLARENCE. Erroneous vassals! the great King of kings\n    Hath in the tables of his law commanded\n    That thou shalt do no murder. Will you then\n    Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?\n    Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hand\n    To hurl upon their heads that break his law.\n  SECOND MURDERER. And that same vengeance doth he hurl\n    on thee\n    For false forswearing, and for murder too;\n    Thou didst receive the sacrament to fight\n    In quarrel of the house of Lancaster. \n  FIRST MURDERER. And like a traitor to the name of God\n    Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade\n    Unripp'dst the bowels of thy sov'reign's son.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Whom thou wast sworn to cherish and\n    defend.\n  FIRST MURDERER. How canst thou urge God's dreadful law\n    to us,\n    When thou hast broke it in such dear degree?\n  CLARENCE. Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?\n    For Edward, for my brother, for his sake.\n    He sends you not to murder me for this,\n    For in that sin he is as deep as I.\n    If God will be avenged for the deed,\n    O, know you yet He doth it publicly.\n    Take not the quarrel from His pow'rful arm;\n    He needs no indirect or lawless course\n    To cut off those that have offended Him.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Who made thee then a bloody minister\n    When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,\n    That princely novice, was struck dead by thee? \n  CLARENCE. My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy\n    faults,\n    Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.\n  CLARENCE. If you do love my brother, hate not me;\n    I am his brother, and I love him well.\n    If you are hir'd for meed, go back again,\n    And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,\n    Who shall reward you better for my life\n    Than Edward will for tidings of my death.\n  SECOND MURDERER. You are deceiv'd: your brother Gloucester\n    hates you.\n  CLARENCE. O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear.\n    Go you to him from me.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, so we will.\n  CLARENCE. Tell him when that our princely father York\n    Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm\n    And charg'd us from his soul to love each other,\n    He little thought of this divided friendship.\n    Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep. \n  FIRST MURDERER. Ay, millstones; as he lesson'd us to weep.\n  CLARENCE. O, do not slander him, for he is kind.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Right, as snow in harvest. Come, you\n    deceive yourself:\n    'Tis he that sends us to destroy you here.\n    CLARENCE. It cannot be; for he bewept my fortune\n    And hugg'd me in his arms, and swore with sobs\n    That he would labour my delivery.\n  FIRST MURDERER. Why, so he doth, when he delivers you\n    From this earth's thraldom to the joys of heaven.\n  SECOND MURDERER. Make peace with God, for you must die,\n    my lord.\n  CLARENCE. Have you that holy feeling in your souls\n    To counsel me to make my peace with God,\n    And are you yet to your own souls so blind\n    That you will war with God by murd'ring me?\n    O, sirs, consider: they that set you on\n    To do this deed will hate you for the deed.\n  SECOND MURDERER. What shall we do?\n  CLARENCE. Relent, and save your souls. \n  FIRST MURDERER. Relent! No, 'tis cowardly and womanish.\n  CLARENCE. Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.\n    Which of you, if you were a prince's son,\n    Being pent from liberty as I am now,\n    If two such murderers as yourselves came to you,\n    Would not entreat for life?\n    My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks;\n    O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,\n    Come thou on my side and entreat for me-\n    As you would beg were you in my distress.\n    A begging prince what beggar pities not?\n  SECOND MURDERER. Look behind you, my lord.\n  FIRST MURDERER.  [Stabbing him]  Take that, and that. If all\n    this will not do,\n    I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.\n                                              Exit with the body\n  SECOND MURDERER. A bloody deed, and desperately\n    dispatch'd!\n    How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands\n    Of this most grievous murder! \n\n                       Re-enter FIRST MURDERER\n\n  FIRST MURDERER-How now, what mean'st thou that thou\n    help'st me not?\n    By heavens, the Duke shall know how slack you have\n    been!\n  SECOND MURDERER. I would he knew that I had sav'd his\n    brother!\n    Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;\n    For I repent me that the Duke is slain.                 Exit\n  FIRST MURDERER. So do not I. Go, coward as thou art.\n    Well, I'll go hide the body in some hole,\n    Till that the Duke give order for his burial;\n    And when I have my meed, I will away;\n    For this will out, and then I must not stay.            Exit\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Enter KING EDWARD sick, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DORSET,\nRIVERS,\nHASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM, GREY, and others\n\n  KING EDWARD. Why, so. Now have I done a good day's\n    work.\n    You peers, continue this united league.\n    I every day expect an embassage\n    From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;\n    And more at peace my soul shall part to heaven,\n    Since I have made my friends at peace on earth.\n    Hastings and Rivers, take each other's hand;\n    Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.\n  RIVERS. By heaven, my soul is purg'd from grudging hate;\n    And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.\n  HASTINGS. So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!\n  KING EDWARD. Take heed you dally not before your king;\n    Lest He that is the supreme King of kings\n    Confound your hidden falsehood and award \n    Either of you to be the other's end.\n  HASTINGS. So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!\n  RIVERS. And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!\n  KING EDWARD. Madam, yourself is not exempt from this;\n    Nor you, son Dorset; Buckingham, nor you:\n    You have been factious one against the other.\n    Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;\n    And what you do, do it unfeignedly.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There, Hastings; I will never more\n    remember\n    Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!\n  KING EDWARD. Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love Lord\n    Marquis.\n  DORSET. This interchange of love, I here protest,\n    Upon my part shall be inviolable.\n  HASTINGS. And so swear I.                       [They embrace]\n  KING EDWARD. Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this\n    league\n    With thy embracements to my wife's allies,\n    And make me happy in your unity. \n  BUCKINGHAM.  [To the QUEEN]  Whenever Buckingham\n    doth turn his hate\n    Upon your Grace, but with all duteous love\n    Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me\n    With hate in those where I expect most love!\n    When I have most need to employ a friend\n    And most assured that he is a friend,\n    Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,\n    Be he unto me! This do I beg of God\n    When I am cold in love to you or yours.\n                                                  [They embrace]\n  KING EDWARD. A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,\n    Is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.\n    There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here\n    To make the blessed period of this peace.\n  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time,\n    Here comes Sir Richard Ratcliff and the Duke.\n\n                      Enter GLOUCESTER, and RATCLIFF\n \n  GLOUCESTER. Good morrow to my sovereign king and\n    Queen;\n    And, princely peers, a happy time of day!\n  KING EDWARD. Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.\n    Gloucester, we have done deeds of charity,\n    Made peace of enmity, fair love of hate,\n    Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.\n  GLOUCESTER. A blessed labour, my most sovereign lord.\n    Among this princely heap, if any here,\n    By false intelligence or wrong surmise,\n    Hold me a foe-\n    If I unwittingly, or in my rage,\n    Have aught committed that is hardly borne\n    To any in this presence, I desire\n    To reconcile me to his friendly peace:\n    'Tis death to me to be at enmity;\n    I hate it, and desire all good men's love.\n    First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,\n    Which I will purchase with my duteous service;\n    Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham, \n    If ever any grudge were lodg'd between us;\n    Of you, and you, Lord Rivers, and of Dorset,\n    That all without desert have frown'd on me;\n    Of you, Lord Woodville, and, Lord Scales, of you;\n    Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen-indeed, of all.\n    I do not know that Englishman alive\n    With whom my soul is any jot at odds\n    More than the infant that is born to-night.\n    I thank my God for my humility.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A holy day shall this be kept hereafter.\n    I would to God all strifes were well compounded.\n    My sovereign lord, I do beseech your Highness\n    To take our brother Clarence to your grace.\n  GLOUCESTER. Why, madam, have I off'red love for this,\n    To be so flouted in this royal presence?\n    Who knows not that the gentle Duke is dead?\n                                                [They all start]\n    You do him injury to scorn his corse.\n  KING EDWARD. Who knows not he is dead! Who knows\n    he is? \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. All-seeing heaven, what a world is this!\n  BUCKINGHAM. Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?\n  DORSET. Ay, my good lord; and no man in the presence\n    But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.\n  KING EDWARD. Is Clarence dead? The order was revers'd.\n  GLOUCESTER. But he, poor man, by your first order died,\n    And that a winged Mercury did bear;\n    Some tardy cripple bare the countermand\n    That came too lag to see him buried.\n    God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,\n    Nearer in bloody thoughts, an not in blood,\n    Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,\n    And yet go current from suspicion!\n\n                           Enter DERBY\n\n  DERBY. A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!\n  KING EDWARD. I prithee, peace; my soul is full of sorrow.\n  DERBY. I Will not rise unless your Highness hear me.\n  KING EDWARD. Then say at once what is it thou requests. \n  DERBY. The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;\n    Who slew to-day a riotous gentleman\n    Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.\n  KING EDWARD. Have I a tongue to doom my brother's death,\n    And shall that tongue give pardon to a slave?\n    My brother killed no man-his fault was thought,\n    And yet his punishment was bitter death.\n    Who sued to me for him? Who, in my wrath,\n    Kneel'd at my feet, and bid me be advis'd?\n    Who spoke of brotherhood? Who spoke of love?\n    Who told me how the poor soul did forsake\n    The mighty Warwick and did fight for me?\n    Who told me, in the field at Tewksbury\n    When Oxford had me down, he rescued me\n    And said 'Dear Brother, live, and be a king'?\n    Who told me, when we both lay in the field\n    Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me\n    Even in his garments, and did give himself,\n    All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?\n    All this from my remembrance brutish wrath \n    Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you\n    Had so much race to put it in my mind.\n    But when your carters or your waiting-vassals\n    Have done a drunken slaughter and defac'd\n    The precious image of our dear Redeemer,\n    You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;\n    And I, unjustly too, must grant it you.        [DERBY rises]\n    But for my brother not a man would speak;\n    Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself\n    For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all\n    Have been beholding to him in his life;\n    Yet none of you would once beg for his life.\n    O God, I fear thy justice will take hold\n    On me, and you, and mine, and yours, for this!\n    Come, Hastings, help me to my closet. Ah, poor Clarence!\n                                 Exeunt some with KING and QUEEN\n  GLOUCESTER. This is the fruits of rashness. Mark'd you not\n    How that the guilty kindred of the Queen\n    Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?\n    O, they did urge it still unto the King! \n    God will revenge it. Come, lords, will you go\n    To comfort Edward with our company?\n  BUCKINGHAM. We wait upon your Grace.                    Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\n\nLondon. The palace\n\nEnter the old DUCHESS OF YORK, with the SON and DAUGHTER of\nCLARENCE\n\n  SON. Good grandam, tell us, is our father dead?\n  DUCHESS. No, boy.\n  DAUGHTER. Why do you weep so oft, and beat your breast,\n    And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'?\n  SON. Why do you look on us, and shake your head,\n    And call us orphans, wretches, castaways,\n    If that our noble father were alive?\n  DUCHESS. My pretty cousins, you mistake me both;\n    I do lament the sickness of the King,\n    As loath to lose him, not your father's death;\n    It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.\n  SON. Then you conclude, my grandam, he is dead.\n    The King mine uncle is to blame for it.\n    God will revenge it; whom I will importune\n    With earnest prayers all to that effect.\n  DAUGHTER. And so will I. \n  DUCHESS. Peace, children, peace! The King doth love you\n    well.\n    Incapable and shallow innocents,\n    You cannot guess who caus'd your father's death.\n  SON. Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester\n    Told me the King, provok'd to it by the Queen,\n    Devis'd impeachments to imprison him.\n    And when my uncle told me so, he wept,\n    And pitied me, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;\n    Bade me rely on him as on my father,\n    And he would love me dearly as a child.\n  DUCHESS. Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shape,\n    And with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice!\n    He is my son; ay, and therein my shame;\n    Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.\n  SON. Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?\n  DUCHESS. Ay, boy.\n  SON. I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?\n\n            Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her \n                ears; RIVERS and DORSET after her\n\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, who shall hinder me to wail and\n    weep,\n    To chide my fortune, and torment myself?\n    I'll join with black despair against my soul\n    And to myself become an enemy.\n  DUCHESS. What means this scene of rude impatience?\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To make an act of tragic violence.\n  EDWARD, my lord, thy son, our king, is dead.\n    Why grow the branches when the root is gone?\n    Why wither not the leaves that want their sap?\n    If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,\n    That our swift-winged souls may catch the King's,\n    Or like obedient subjects follow him\n    To his new kingdom of ne'er-changing night.\n  DUCHESS. Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow\n    As I had title in thy noble husband!\n    I have bewept a worthy husband's death,\n    And liv'd with looking on his images; \n    But now two mirrors of his princely semblance\n    Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,\n    And I for comfort have but one false glass,\n    That grieves me when I see my shame in him.\n    Thou art a widow, yet thou art a mother\n    And hast the comfort of thy children left;\n    But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms\n    And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble hands-\n    Clarence and Edward. O, what cause have I-\n    Thine being but a moiety of my moan-\n    To overgo thy woes and drown thy cries?\n  SON. Ah, aunt, you wept not for our father's death!\n    How can we aid you with our kindred tears?\n  DAUGHTER. Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;\n    Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Give me no help in lamentation;\n    I am not barren to bring forth complaints.\n    All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes\n    That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,\n    May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world! \n    Ah for my husband, for my dear Lord Edward!\n  CHILDREN. Ah for our father, for our dear Lord Clarence!\n  DUCHESS. Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What stay had I but Edward? and he's\n    gone.\n  CHILDREN. What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.\n  DUCHESS. What stays had I but they? and they are gone.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Was never widow had so dear a loss.\n  CHILDREN. Were never orphans had so dear a loss.\n  DUCHESS. Was never mother had so dear a loss.\n    Alas, I am the mother of these griefs!\n    Their woes are parcell'd, mine is general.\n    She for an Edward weeps, and so do I:\n    I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she.\n    These babes for Clarence weep, and so do I:\n    I for an Edward weep, so do not they.\n    Alas, you three on me, threefold distress'd,\n    Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,\n    And I will pamper it with lamentation.\n  DORSET. Comfort, dear mother. God is much displeas'd \n    That you take with unthankfulness his doing.\n    In common worldly things 'tis called ungrateful\n    With dull unwillingness to repay a debt\n    Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;\n    Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,\n    For it requires the royal debt it lent you.\n  RIVERS. Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,\n    Of the young prince your son. Send straight for him;\n    Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives.\n    Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,\n    And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.\n\n               Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY,\n                      HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF\n\n  GLOUCESTER. Sister, have comfort. All of us have cause\n    To wail the dimming of our shining star;\n    But none can help our harms by wailing them.\n    Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;\n    I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee \n    I crave your blessing.\n  DUCHESS. God bless thee; and put meekness in thy breast,\n    Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!\n  GLOUCESTER. Amen!  [Aside]  And make me die a good old\n    man!\n    That is the butt end of a mother's blessing;\n    I marvel that her Grace did leave it out.\n  BUCKINGHAM. You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing\n    peers,\n    That bear this heavy mutual load of moan,\n    Now cheer each other in each other's love.\n    Though we have spent our harvest of this king,\n    We are to reap the harvest of his son.\n    The broken rancour of your high-swol'n hearts,\n    But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,\n    Must gently be preserv'd, cherish'd, and kept.\n    Me seemeth good that, with some little train,\n    Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fet\n    Hither to London, to be crown'd our King.\n\n RIVERS. Why with some little train, my Lord of \n    Buckingham?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Marry, my lord, lest by a multitude\n    The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,\n    Which would be so much the more dangerous\n    By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd;\n    Where every horse bears his commanding rein\n    And may direct his course as please himself,\n    As well the fear of harm as harm apparent,\n    In my opinion, ought to be prevented.\n  GLOUCESTER. I hope the King made peace with all of us;\n    And the compact is firm and true in me.\n  RIVERS. And so in me; and so, I think, in an.\n    Yet, since it is but green, it should be put\n    To no apparent likelihood of breach,\n    Which haply by much company might be urg'd;\n    Therefore I say with noble Buckingham\n    That it is meet so few should fetch the Prince.\n  HASTINGS. And so say I.\n  GLOUCESTER. Then be it so; and go we to determine\n    Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow. \n    Madam, and you, my sister, will you go\n    To give your censures in this business?\n                        Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM and GLOUCESTER\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,\n    For God sake, let not us two stay at home;\n    For by the way I'll sort occasion,\n    As index to the story we late talk'd of,\n    To part the Queen's proud kindred from the Prince.\n  GLOUCESTER. My other self, my counsel's consistory,\n    My oracle, my prophet, my dear cousin,\n    I, as a child, will go by thy direction.\n    Toward Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.        Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\n\nLondon. A street\n\nEnter one CITIZEN at one door, and another at the other\n\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Good morrow, neighbour. Whither away so\n    fast?\n  SECOND CITIZEN. I promise you, I scarcely know myself.\n    Hear you the news abroad?\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Yes, that the King is dead.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Ill news, by'r lady; seldom comes the\n    better.\n    I fear, I fear 'twill prove a giddy world.\n\n                        Enter another CITIZEN\n\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Neighbours, God speed!\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Give you good morrow, sir.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Doth the news hold of good King Edward's\n    death?\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while! \n  THIRD CITIZEN. Then, masters, look to see a troublous\n    world.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. No, no; by God's good grace, his son shall\n    reign.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Woe to that land that's govern'd by a child.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. In him there is a hope of government,\n    Which, in his nonage, council under him,\n    And, in his full and ripened years, himself,\n    No doubt, shall then, and till then, govern well.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. So stood the state when Henry the Sixth\n    Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Stood the state so? No, no, good friends,\n    God wot;\n    For then this land was famously enrich'd\n    With politic grave counsel; then the King\n    Had virtuous uncles to protect his Grace.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Why, so hath this, both by his father and\n    mother.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Better it were they all came by his father,\n    Or by his father there were none at all; \n    For emulation who shall now be nearest\n    Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.\n    O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!\n    And the Queen's sons and brothers haught and proud;\n    And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule,\n    This sickly land might solace as before.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Come, come, we fear the worst; all will be\n    well.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. When clouds are seen, wise men put on\n    their cloaks;\n    When great leaves fall, then winter is at hand;\n    When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?\n    Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.\n    All may be well; but, if God sort it so,\n    'Tis more than we deserve or I expect.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Truly, the hearts of men are fun of fear.\n    You cannot reason almost with a man\n    That looks not heavily and fun of dread.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Before the days of change, still is it so;\n    By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust \n    Ensuing danger; as by proof we see\n    The water swell before a boist'rous storm.\n    But leave it all to God. Whither away?\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Marry, we were sent for to the justices.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. And so was I; I'll bear you company.\n                                                          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4.\n\nLondon. The palace\n\nEnter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the young DUKE OF YORK, QUEEN\nELIZABETH,\nand the DUCHESS OF YORK\n\n  ARCHBISHOP. Last night, I hear, they lay at Stony Stratford,\n    And at Northampton they do rest to-night;\n    To-morrow or next day they will be here.\n  DUCHESS. I long with all my heart to see the Prince.\n    I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But I hear no; they say my son of York\n    Has almost overta'en him in his growth.\n  YORK. Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.\n  DUCHESS. Why, my good cousin, it is good to grow.\n  YORK. Grandam, one night as we did sit at supper,\n    My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow\n    More than my brother. 'Ay,' quoth my uncle Gloucester\n    'Small herbs have grace: great weeds do grow apace.'\n    And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,\n    Because sweet flow'rs are slow and weeds make haste. \n  DUCHESS. Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold\n    In him that did object the same to thee.\n    He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,\n    So long a-growing and so leisurely\n    That, if his rule were true, he should be gracious.\n  ARCHBISHOP. And so no doubt he is, my gracious madam.\n  DUCHESS. I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.\n  YORK. Now, by my troth, if I had been rememb'red,\n    I could have given my uncle's Grace a flout\n    To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.\n  DUCHESS. How, my young York? I prithee let me hear it.\n  YORK. Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast\n    That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old.\n    'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.\n    Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.\n  DUCHESS. I prithee, pretty York, who told thee this?\n  YORK. Grandam, his nurse.\n  DUCHESS. His nurse! Why she was dead ere thou wast\n    born.\n  YORK. If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me. \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. A parlous boy! Go to, you are too\n    shrewd.\n  ARCHBISHOP. Good madam, be not angry with the child.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Pitchers have ears.\n\n                        Enter a MESSENGER\n\n  ARCHBISHOP. Here comes a messenger. What news?\n  MESSENGER. Such news, my lord, as grieves me to report.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How doth the Prince?\n  MESSENGER. Well, madam, and in health.\n  DUCHESS. What is thy news?\n  MESSENGER. Lord Rivers and Lord Grey\n    Are sent to Pomfret, and with them\n    Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.\n  DUCHESS. Who hath committed them?\n  MESSENGER. The mighty Dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham.\n  ARCHBISHOP. For what offence?\n  MESSENGER. The sum of all I can, I have disclos'd.\n    Why or for what the nobles were committed \n    Is all unknown to me, my gracious lord.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ay me, I see the ruin of my house!\n    The tiger now hath seiz'd the gentle hind;\n    Insulting tyranny begins to jet\n    Upon the innocent and aweless throne.\n    Welcome, destruction, blood, and massacre!\n    I see, as in a map, the end of all.\n  DUCHESS. Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,\n    How many of you have mine eyes beheld!\n    My husband lost his life to get the crown;\n    And often up and down my sons were toss'd\n    For me to joy and weep their gain and loss;\n    And being seated, and domestic broils\n    Clean over-blown, themselves the conquerors\n    Make war upon themselves-brother to brother,\n    Blood to blood, self against self. O, preposterous\n    And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen,\n    Or let me die, to look on death no more!\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Come, come, my boy; we will to\n    sanctuary. \n    Madam, farewell.\n  DUCHESS. Stay, I will go with you.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. You have no cause.\n  ARCHBISHOP.

Enter the PRINCE OF WALES, GLOUCESTER,\nBUCKINGHAM,\nCATESBY, CARDINAL BOURCHIER, and others\n\n  BUCKINGHAM. Welcome, sweet Prince, to London, to your\n    chamber.\n  GLOUCESTER. Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign.\n    The weary way hath made you melancholy.\n  PRINCE. No, uncle; but our crosses on the way\n    Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy.\n    I want more uncles here to welcome me.\n  GLOUCESTER. Sweet Prince, the untainted virtue of your\n    years\n    Hath not yet div'd into the world's deceit;\n    Nor more can you distinguish of a man\n    Than of his outward show; which, God He knows,\n    Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.\n    Those uncles which you want were dangerous;\n    Your Grace attended to their sug'red words \n    But look'd not on the poison of their hearts.\n    God keep you from them and from such false friends!\n  PRINCE. God keep me from false friends! but they were\n    none.\n  GLOUCESTER. My lord, the Mayor of London comes to greet\n    you.\n\n                Enter the LORD MAYOR and his train\n\n  MAYOR. God bless your Grace with health and happy days!\n  PRINCE. I thank you, good my lord, and thank you all.\n    I thought my mother and my brother York\n    Would long ere this have met us on the way.\n    Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not\n    To tell us whether they will come or no!\n\n                        Enter LORD HASTINGS\n\n  BUCKINGHAM. And, in good time, here comes the sweating\n    Lord. \n  PRINCE. Welcome, my lord. What, will our mother come?\n  HASTINGS. On what occasion, God He knows, not I,\n    The Queen your mother and your brother York\n    Have taken sanctuary. The tender Prince\n    Would fain have come with me to meet your Grace,\n    But by his mother was perforce withheld.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Fie, what an indirect and peevish course\n    Is this of hers? Lord Cardinal, will your Grace\n    Persuade the Queen to send the Duke of York\n    Unto his princely brother presently?\n    If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him\n    And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.\n  CARDINAL. My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory\n    Can from his mother win the Duke of York,\n    Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate\n    To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid\n    We should infringe the holy privilege\n    Of blessed sanctuary! Not for all this land\n    Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.\n  BUCKINGHAM. You are too senseless-obstinate, my lord, \n    Too ceremonious and traditional.\n    Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,\n    You break not sanctuary in seizing him.\n    The benefit thereof is always granted\n    To those whose dealings have deserv'd the place\n    And those who have the wit to claim the place.\n    This Prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserv'd it,\n    And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it.\n    Then, taking him from thence that is not there,\n    You break no privilege nor charter there.\n    Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;\n    But sanctuary children never till now.\n  CARDINAL. My lord, you shall o'errule my mind for once.\n    Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?\n  HASTINGS. I go, my lord.\n  PRINCE. Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.\n                                    Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS\n    Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,\n    Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?\n  GLOUCESTER. Where it seems best unto your royal self. \n    If I may counsel you, some day or two\n    Your Highness shall repose you at the Tower,\n    Then where you please and shall be thought most fit\n    For your best health and recreation.\n  PRINCE. I do not like the Tower, of any place.\n    Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?\n  BUCKINGHAM. He did, my gracious lord, begin that place,\n    Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.\n  PRINCE. Is it upon record, or else reported\n    Successively from age to age, he built it?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Upon record, my gracious lord.\n  PRINCE. But say, my lord, it were not regist'red,\n    Methinks the truth should Eve from age to age,\n    As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,\n    Even to the general all-ending day.\n  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never\n    live long.\n  PRINCE. What say you, uncle?\n  GLOUCESTER. I say, without characters, fame lives long.\n    [Aside]  Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity, \n    I moralize two meanings in one word.\n  PRINCE. That Julius Caesar was a famous man;\n    With what his valour did enrich his wit,\n    His wit set down to make his valour live.\n    Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;\n    For now he lives in fame, though not in life.\n    I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham-\n  BUCKINGHAM. What, my gracious lord?\n  PRINCE. An if I live until I be a man,\n    I'll win our ancient right in France again,\n    Or die a soldier as I liv'd a king.\n  GLOUCESTER.  [Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward\n    spring.\n\n              Enter HASTINGS, young YORK, and the CARDINAL\n\n  BUCKINGHAM. Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of\n    York.\n  PRINCE. Richard of York, how fares our loving brother?\n  YORK. Well, my dread lord; so must I can you now. \n  PRINCE. Ay brother, to our grief, as it is yours.\n    Too late he died that might have kept that title,\n    Which by his death hath lost much majesty.\n  GLOUCESTER. How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?\n  YORK. I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,\n    You said that idle weeds are fast in growth.\n    The Prince my brother hath outgrown me far.\n  GLOUCESTER. He hath, my lord.\n  YORK. And therefore is he idle?\n  GLOUCESTER. O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.\n  YORK. Then he is more beholding to you than I.\n  GLOUCESTER. He may command me as my sovereign;\n    But you have power in me as in a kinsman.\n  YORK. I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.\n  GLOUCESTER. My dagger, little cousin? With all my heart!\n  PRINCE. A beggar, brother?\n  YORK. Of my kind uncle, that I know will give,\n    And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.\n  GLOUCESTER. A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.\n  YORK. A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it! \n  GLOUCESTER. Ay, gentle cousin, were it light enough.\n  YORK. O, then, I see you will part but with light gifts:\n    In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.\n  GLOUCESTER. It is too heavy for your Grace to wear.\n  YORK. I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.\n  GLOUCESTER. What, would you have my weapon, little\n    Lord?\n  YORK. I would, that I might thank you as you call me.\n  GLOUCESTER. How?\n  YORK. Little.\n  PRINCE. My Lord of York will still be cross in talk.\n    Uncle, your Grace knows how to bear with him.\n  YORK. You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me.\n    Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;\n    Because that I am little, like an ape,\n    He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.\n  BUCKINGHAM. With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!\n    To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle\n    He prettily and aptly taunts himself.\n    So cunning and so young is wonderful. \n  GLOUCESTER. My lord, will't please you pass along?\n    Myself and my good cousin Buckingham\n    Will to your mother, to entreat of her\n    To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.\n  YORK. What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?\n  PRINCE. My Lord Protector needs will have it so.\n  YORK. I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.\n  GLOUCESTER. Why, what should you fear?\n  YORK. Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost.\n    My grandam told me he was murder'd there.\n  PRINCE. I fear no uncles dead.\n  GLOUCESTER. Nor none that live, I hope.\n  PRINCE. An if they live, I hope I need not fear.\n    But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,\n    Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.\n    A sennet.\n              Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, and CATESBY\n  BUCKINGHAM. Think you, my lord, this little prating York\n    Was not incensed by his subtle mother\n    To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously? \n  GLOUCESTER. No doubt, no doubt. O, 'tis a perilous boy;\n    Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable.\n    He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.\n    Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend\n    As closely to conceal what we impart.\n    Thou know'st our reasons urg'd upon the way.\n    What think'st thou? Is it not an easy matter\n    To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,\n    For the instalment of this noble Duke\n    In the seat royal of this famous isle?\n  CATESBY. He for his father's sake so loves the Prince\n    That he will not be won to aught against him.\n  BUCKINGHAM. What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will\n    not he?\n  CATESBY. He will do all in all as Hastings doth.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Well then, no more but this: go, gentle\n    Catesby,\n    And, as it were far off, sound thou Lord Hastings\n    How he doth stand affected to our purpose; \n    And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,\n    To sit about the coronation.\n    If thou dost find him tractable to us,\n    Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons;\n    If he be leaden, icy, cold, unwilling,\n    Be thou so too, and so break off the talk,\n    And give us notice of his inclination;\n    For we to-morrow hold divided councils,\n    Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.\n  GLOUCESTER. Commend me to Lord William. Tell him,\n    Catesby,\n    His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries\n    To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle;\n    And bid my lord, for joy of this good news,\n    Give Mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Good Catesby, go effect this business soundly.\n  CATESBY. My good lords both, with all the heed I can.\n  GLOUCESTER. Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?\n  CATESBY. You shall, my lord.\n  GLOUCESTER. At Crosby House, there shall you find us both. \n                                                    Exit CATESBY\n  BUCKINGHAM. Now, my lord, what shall we do if we\n    perceive\n    Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?\n  GLOUCESTER. Chop off his head-something we will\n    determine.\n    And, look when I am King, claim thou of me\n    The earldom of Hereford and all the movables\n    Whereof the King my brother was possess'd.\n  BUCKINGHAM. I'll claim that promise at your Grace's hand.\n  GLOUCESTER. And look to have it yielded with all kindness.\n    Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards\n    We may digest our complots in some form.              Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\n\nBefore LORD HASTING'S house\n\nEnter a MESSENGER to the door of HASTINGS\n\n  MESSENGER. My lord, my lord!                        [Knocking]\n  HASTINGS.  [Within]  Who knocks?\n  MESSENGER. One from the Lord Stanley.\n  HASTINGS.  [Within]  What is't o'clock?\n  MESSENGER. Upon the stroke of four.\n\n                        Enter LORD HASTINGS\n\n  HASTINGS. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleep these tedious\n    nights?\n  MESSENGER. So it appears by that I have to say.\n    First, he commends him to your noble self.\n  HASTINGS. What then?\n  MESSENGER. Then certifies your lordship that this night\n    He dreamt the boar had razed off his helm.\n    Besides, he says there are two councils kept,\n    And that may be determin'd at the one \n    Which may make you and him to rue at th' other.\n    Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure-\n    If you will presently take horse with him\n    And with all speed post with him toward the north\n    To shun the danger that his soul divines.\n  HASTINGS. Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;\n    Bid him not fear the separated council:\n    His honour and myself are at the one,\n    And at the other is my good friend Catesby;\n    Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us\n    Whereof I shall not have intelligence.\n    Tell him his fears are shallow, without instance;\n    And for his dreams, I wonder he's so simple\n    To trust the mock'ry of unquiet slumbers.\n    To fly the boar before the boar pursues\n    Were to incense the boar to follow us\n    And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.\n    Go, bid thy master rise and come to me;\n    And we will both together to the Tower,\n    Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly. \n  MESSENGER. I'll go, my lord, and tell him what you say.\n Exit\n\n                         Enter CATESBY\n\n  CATESBY. Many good morrows to my noble lord!\n  HASTINGS. Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring.\n    What news, what news, in this our tott'ring state?\n  CATESBY. It is a reeling world indeed, my lord;\n    And I believe will never stand upright\n    Till Richard wear the garland of the realm.\n  HASTINGS. How, wear the garland! Dost thou mean the\n    crown?\n  CATESBY. Ay, my good lord.\n  HASTINGS. I'll have this crown of mine cut from my\n    shoulders\n    Before I'll see the crown so foul misplac'd.\n    But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?\n  CATESBY. Ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward\n    Upon his party for the gain thereof; \n    And thereupon he sends you this good news,\n    That this same very day your enemies,\n    The kindred of the Queen, must die at Pomfret.\n  HASTINGS. Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,\n    Because they have been still my adversaries;\n    But that I'll give my voice on Richard's side\n    To bar my master's heirs in true descent,\n    God knows I will not do it to the death.\n  CATESBY. God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!\n  HASTINGS. But I shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,\n    That they which brought me in my master's hate,\n    I live to look upon their tragedy.\n    Well, Catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,\n    I'll send some packing that yet think not on't.\n  CATESBY. 'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,\n    When men are unprepar'd and look not for it.\n  HASTINGS. O monstrous, monstrous! And so falls it out\n    With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey; and so 'twill do\n    With some men else that think themselves as safe\n    As thou and I, who, as thou knowest, are dear \n    To princely Richard and to Buckingham.\n  CATESBY. The Princes both make high account of you-\n    [Aside]  For they account his head upon the bridge.\n  HASTINGS. I know they do, and I have well deserv'd it.\n\n                      Enter LORD STANLEY\n\n    Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?\n    Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?\n  STANLEY. My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby.\n    You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,\n    I do not like these several councils, I.\n  HASTINGS. My lord, I hold my life as dear as yours,\n    And never in my days, I do protest,\n    Was it so precious to me as 'tis now.\n    Think you, but that I know our state secure,\n    I would be so triumphant as I am?\n  STANLEY. The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from\n    London,\n    Were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure, \n    And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;\n    But yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.\n    This sudden stab of rancour I misdoubt;\n    Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward.\n    What, shall we toward the Tower? The day is spent.\n  HASTINGS. Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my\n    Lord?\n    To-day the lords you talk'd of are beheaded.\n  STANLEY. They, for their truth, might better wear their\n    heads\n    Than some that have accus'd them wear their hats.\n    But come, my lord, let's away.\n\n                 Enter HASTINGS, a pursuivant\n\n  HASTINGS. Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.\n                                      Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY\n    How now, Hastings! How goes the world with thee?\n  PURSUIVANT. The better that your lordship please to ask.\n  HASTINGS. I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now \n    Than when thou met'st me last where now we meet:\n    Then was I going prisoner to the Tower\n    By the suggestion of the Queen's allies;\n    But now, I tell thee-keep it to thyself-\n    This day those enernies are put to death,\n    And I in better state than e'er I was.\n  PURSUIVANT. God hold it, to your honour's good content!\n  HASTINGS. Gramercy, Hastings; there, drink that for me.\n                                          [Throws him his purse]\n  PURSUIVANT. I thank your honour.                          Exit\n\n                            Enter a PRIEST\n\n  PRIEST. Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.\n  HASTINGS. I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.\n    I am in your debt for your last exercise;\n    Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.\n                                        [He whispers in his ear]\n  PRIEST. I'll wait upon your lordship.\n \n                            Enter BUCKINGHAM\n\n  BUCKINGHAM. What, talking with a priest, Lord\n    Chamberlain!\n    Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest:\n    Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.\n  HASTINGS. Good faith, and when I met this holy man,\n    The men you talk of came into my mind.\n    What, go you toward the Tower?\n  BUCKINGHAM. I do, my lord, but long I cannot stay there;\n    I shall return before your lordship thence.\n  HASTINGS. Nay, like enough, for I stay dinner there.\n  BUCKINGHAM.  [Aside]  And supper too, although thou\n    knowest it not.-\n    Come, will you go?\n  HASTINGS. I'll wait upon your lordship.                 Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\n\nPomfret Castle\n\nEnter SIR RICHARD RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying the Nobles,\nRIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN, to death\n\n  RIVERS. Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:\n    To-day shalt thou behold a subject die\n    For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.\n  GREY. God bless the Prince from all the pack of you!\n    A knot you are of damned blood-suckers.\n  VAUGHAN. You live that shall cry woe for this hereafter.\n  RATCLIFF. Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.\n  RIVERS. O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,\n    Fatal and ominous to noble peers!\n    Within the guilty closure of thy walls\n  RICHARD the Second here was hack'd to death;\n    And for more slander to thy dismal seat,\n    We give to thee our guiltless blood to drink.\n  GREY. Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,\n    When she exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I, \n    For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.\n  RIVERS. Then curs'd she Richard, then curs'd she\n    Buckingham,\n    Then curs'd she Hastings. O, remember, God,\n    To hear her prayer for them, as now for us!\n    And for my sister, and her princely sons,\n    Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,\n    Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.\n  RATCLIFF. Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.\n  RIVERS. Come, Grey; come, Vaughan; let us here embrace.\n    Farewell, until we meet again in heaven.              Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4\n\nLondon. The Tower\n\nEnter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP of ELY, RATCLIFF,\nLOVEL,\nwith others and seat themselves at a table\n\n  HASTINGS. Now, noble peers, the cause why we are met\n    Is to determine of the coronation.\n    In God's name speak-when is the royal day?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Is all things ready for the royal time?\n  DERBY. It is, and wants but nomination.\n  BISHOP OF ELY. To-morrow then I judge a happy day.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Who knows the Lord Protector's mind\n    herein?\n    Who is most inward with the noble Duke?\n  BISHOP OF ELY. Your Grace, we think, should soonest know\n    his mind.\n  BUCKINGHAM. We know each other's faces; for our hearts,\n    He knows no more of mine than I of yours;\n    Or I of his, my lord, than you of mine.\n    Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love. \n  HASTINGS. I thank his Grace, I know he loves me well;\n    But for his purpose in the coronation\n    I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd\n    His gracious pleasure any way therein.\n    But you, my honourable lords, may name the time;\n    And in the Duke's behalf I'll give my voice,\n    Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.\n\n                       Enter GLOUCESTER\n\n  BISHOP OF ELY. In happy time, here comes the Duke himself.\n  GLOUCESTER. My noble lords and cousins an, good morrow.\n    I have been long a sleeper, but I trust\n    My absence doth neglect no great design\n    Which by my presence might have been concluded.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Had you not come upon your cue, my lord,\n  WILLIAM Lord Hastings had pronounc'd your part-\n    I mean, your voice for crowning of the King.\n  GLOUCESTER. Than my Lord Hastings no man might be\n    bolder; \n    His lordship knows me well and loves me well.\n    My lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborn\n    I saw good strawberries in your garden there.\n    I do beseech you send for some of them.\n  BISHOP of ELY. Marry and will, my lord, with all my heart.\n Exit\n  GLOUCESTER. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.\n                                               [Takes him aside]\n    Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,\n    And finds the testy gentleman so hot\n    That he will lose his head ere give consent\n    His master's child, as worshipfully he terms it,\n    Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Withdraw yourself awhile; I'll go with you.\n                                Exeunt GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM\n  DERBY. We have not yet set down this day of triumph.\n    To-morrow, in my judgment, is too sudden;\n    For I myself am not so well provided\n    As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.\n \n                    Re-enter the BISHOP OF ELY\n\n  BISHOP OF ELY. Where is my lord the Duke of Gloucester?\n    I have sent for these strawberries.\n  HASTINGS. His Grace looks cheerfully and smooth this\n    morning;\n    There's some conceit or other likes him well\n    When that he bids good morrow with such spirit.\n    I think there's never a man in Christendom\n    Can lesser hide his love or hate than he;\n    For by his face straight shall you know his heart.\n  DERBY. What of his heart perceive you in his face\n    By any livelihood he show'd to-day?\n  HASTINGS. Marry, that with no man here he is offended;\n    For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.\n\n               Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM\n\n  GLOUCESTER. I pray you all, tell me what they deserve\n    That do conspire my death with devilish plots \n    Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd\n    Upon my body with their hellish charms?\n  HASTINGS. The tender love I bear your Grace, my lord,\n    Makes me most forward in this princely presence\n    To doom th' offenders, whosoe'er they be.\n    I say, my lord, they have deserved death.\n  GLOUCESTER. Then be your eyes the witness of their evil.\n    Look how I am bewitch'd; behold, mine arm\n    Is like a blasted sapling wither'd up.\n    And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,\n    Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,\n    That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.\n  HASTINGS. If they have done this deed, my noble lord-\n  GLOUCESTER. If?-thou protector of this damned strumpet,\n    Talk'st thou to me of ifs? Thou art a traitor.\n    Off with his head! Now by Saint Paul I swear\n    I will not dine until I see the same.\n    Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done.\n    The rest that love me, rise and follow me.\n                    Exeunt all but HASTINGS, LOVEL, and RATCLIFF \n  HASTINGS. Woe, woe, for England! not a whit for me;\n    For I, too fond, might have prevented this.\n  STANLEY did dream the boar did raze our helms,\n    And I did scorn it and disdain to fly.\n    Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,\n    And started when he look'd upon the Tower,\n    As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.\n    O, now I need the priest that spake to me!\n    I now repent I told the pursuivant,\n    As too triumphing, how mine enemies\n    To-day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,\n    And I myself secure in grace and favour.\n    O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse\n    Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!\n  RATCLIFF. Come, come, dispatch; the Duke would be at\n    dinner.\n    Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.\n  HASTINGS. O momentary grace of mortal men,\n    Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!\n    Who builds his hope in air of your good looks \n    Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,\n    Ready with every nod to tumble down\n    Into the fatal bowels of the deep.\n  LOVEL. Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.\n  HASTINGS. O bloody Richard! Miserable England!\n    I prophesy the fearfull'st time to thee\n    That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.\n    Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.\n    They smile at me who shortly shall be dead.           Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 5.\n\nLondon. The Tower-walls\n\nEnter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM in rotten armour, marvellous\nill-favoured\n\n  GLOUCESTER. Come, cousin, canst thou quake and change\n    thy colour,\n    Murder thy breath in middle of a word,\n    And then again begin, and stop again,\n    As if thou were distraught and mad with terror?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;\n    Speak and look back, and pry on every side,\n    Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,\n    Intending deep suspicion. Ghastly looks\n    Are at my service, like enforced smiles;\n    And both are ready in their offices\n    At any time to grace my stratagems.\n    But what, is Catesby gone?\n  GLOUCESTER. He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.\n\n                 Enter the LORD MAYOR and CATESBY \n\n  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor-\n  GLOUCESTER. Look to the drawbridge there!\n  BUCKINGHAM. Hark! a drum.\n  GLOUCESTER. Catesby, o'erlook the walls.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Lord Mayor, the reason we have sent-\n  GLOUCESTER. Look back, defend thee; here are enemies.\n  BUCKINGHAM. God and our innocence defend and guard us!\n\n           Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head\n\n  GLOUCESTER. Be patient; they are friends-Ratcliff and Lovel.\n  LOVEL. Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,\n    The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.\n  GLOUCESTER. So dear I lov'd the man that I must weep.\n    I took him for the plainest harmless creature\n    That breath'd upon the earth a Christian;\n    Made him my book, wherein my soul recorded\n    The history of all her secret thoughts.\n    So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue \n    That, his apparent open guilt omitted,\n    I mean his conversation with Shore's wife-\n    He liv'd from all attainder of suspects.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Well, well, he was the covert'st shelt'red\n    traitor\n    That ever liv'd.\n    Would you imagine, or almost believe-\n    Were't not that by great preservation\n    We live to tell it-that the subtle traitor\n    This day had plotted, in the council-house,\n    To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester.\n  MAYOR. Had he done so?\n  GLOUCESTER. What! think you we are Turks or Infidels?\n    Or that we would, against the form of law,\n    Proceed thus rashly in the villain's death\n    But that the extreme peril of the case,\n    The peace of England and our persons' safety,\n    Enforc'd us to this execution?\n  MAYOR. Now, fair befall you! He deserv'd his death;\n    And your good Graces both have well proceeded \n    To warn false traitors from the like attempts.\n    I never look'd for better at his hands\n    After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Yet had we not determin'd he should die\n    Until your lordship came to see his end-\n    Which now the loving haste of these our friends,\n    Something against our meanings, have prevented-\n    Because, my lord, I would have had you heard\n    The traitor speak, and timorously confess\n    The manner and the purpose of his treasons:\n    That you might well have signified the same\n    Unto the citizens, who haply may\n    Misconster us in him and wail his death.\n  MAYOR. But, my good lord, your Grace's words shall serve\n    As well as I had seen and heard him speak;\n    And do not doubt, right noble Princes both,\n    But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens\n    With all your just proceedings in this cause.\n  GLOUCESTER. And to that end we wish'd your lordship here,\n    T' avoid the the the censures of the carping world. \n  BUCKINGHAM. Which since you come too late of our intent,\n    Yet witness what you hear we did intend.\n    And so, my good Lord Mayor, we bid farewell.\n                                                 Exit LORD MAYOR\n  GLOUCESTER. Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.\n    The Mayor towards Guildhall hies him in an post.\n    There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,\n    Infer the bastardy of Edward's children.\n    Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen\n    Only for saying he would make his son\n    Heir to the crown-meaning indeed his house,\n    Which by the sign thereof was termed so.\n    Moreover, urge his hateful luxury\n    And bestial appetite in change of lust,\n    Which stretch'd unto their servants, daughters, wives,\n    Even where his raging eye or savage heart\n    Without control lusted to make a prey.\n    Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:\n    Tell them, when that my mother went with child\n    Of that insatiate Edward, noble York \n    My princely father then had wars in France\n    And, by true computation of the time,\n    Found that the issue was not his begot;\n    Which well appeared in his lineaments,\n    Being nothing like the noble Duke my father.\n    Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off;\n    Because, my lord, you know my mother lives.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Doubt not, my lord, I'll play the orator\n    As if the golden fee for which I plead\n    Were for myself; and so, my lord, adieu.\n  GLOUCESTER. If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's\n    Castle;\n    Where you shall find me well accompanied\n    With reverend fathers and well learned bishops.\n  BUCKINGHAM. I go; and towards three or four o'clock\n    Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.           Exit\n  GLOUCESTER. Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw.\n    [To CATESBY]  Go thou to Friar Penker. Bid them both\n    Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.\n                                       Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER \n    Now will I go to take some privy order\n    To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight,\n    And to give order that no manner person\n    Have any time recourse unto the Princes.                Exit\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 6.\n\nLondon. A street\n\nEnter a SCRIVENER\n\n  SCRIVENER. Here is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;\n    Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd\n    That it may be to-day read o'er in Paul's.\n    And mark how well the sequel hangs together:\n    Eleven hours I have spent to write it over,\n    For yesternight by Catesby was it sent me;\n    The precedent was full as long a-doing;\n    And yet within these five hours Hastings liv'd,\n    Untainted, unexamin'd, free, at liberty.\n    Here's a good world the while! Who is so gros\n    That cannot see this palpable device?\n    Yet who's so bold but says he sees it not?\n    Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,\n    When such ill dealing must be seen in thought.          Exit\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 7.\n\nLondon. Baynard's Castle\n\nEnter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors\n\n  GLOUCESTER. How now, how now! What say the citizens?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Now, by the holy Mother of our Lord,\n    The citizens are mum, say not a word.\n  GLOUCESTER. Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's\n    children?\n  BUCKINGHAM. I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,\n    And his contract by deputy in France;\n    Th' insatiate greediness of his desire,\n    And his enforcement of the city wives;\n    His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,\n    As being got, your father then in France,\n    And his resemblance, being not like the Duke.\n    Withal I did infer your lineaments,\n    Being the right idea of your father,\n    Both in your form and nobleness of mind;\n    Laid open all your victories in Scotland,\n    Your discipline in war, wisdom in peace, \n    Your bounty, virtue, fair humility;\n    Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose\n    Untouch'd or slightly handled in discourse.\n    And when mine oratory drew toward end\n    I bid them that did love their country's good\n    Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal King!'\n  GLOUCESTER. And did they so?\n  BUCKINGHAM. No, so God help me, they spake not a word;\n    But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,\n    Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale.\n    Which when I saw, I reprehended them,\n    And ask'd the Mayor what meant this wilfull silence.\n    His answer was, the people were not used\n    To be spoke to but by the Recorder.\n    Then he was urg'd to tell my tale again.\n    'Thus saith the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd'-\n    But nothing spoke in warrant from himself.\n    When he had done, some followers of mine own\n    At lower end of the hall hurl'd up their caps,\n    And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!' \n    And thus I took the vantage of those few-\n    'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I\n    'This general applause and cheerful shout\n    Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard.'\n    And even here brake off and came away.\n  GLOUCESTER. What, tongueless blocks were they? Would\n    they not speak?\n    Will not the Mayor then and his brethren come?\n  BUCKINGHAM. The Mayor is here at hand. Intend some fear;\n    Be not you spoke with but by mighty suit;\n    And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,\n    And stand between two churchmen, good my lord;\n    For on that ground I'll make a holy descant;\n    And be not easily won to our requests.\n    Play the maid's part: still answer nay, and take it.\n  GLOUCESTER. I go; and if you plead as well for them\n    As I can say nay to thee for myself,\n    No doubt we bring it to a happy issue.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Go, go, up to the leads; the Lord Mayor\n    knocks.                                      Exit GLOUCESTER \n\n           Enter the LORD MAYOR, ALDERMEN, and citizens\n\n    Welcome, my lord. I dance attendance here;\n    I think the Duke will not be spoke withal.\n\n                         Enter CATESBY\n\n    Now, Catesby, what says your lord to my request?\n  CATESBY. He doth entreat your Grace, my noble lord,\n    To visit him to-morrow or next day.\n    He is within, with two right reverend fathers,\n    Divinely bent to meditation;\n    And in no worldly suits would he be mov'd,\n    To draw him from his holy exercise.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Return, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke;\n    Tell him, myself, the Mayor and Aldermen,\n    In deep designs, in matter of great moment,\n    No less importing than our general good,\n    Are come to have some conference with his Grace. \n  CATESBY. I'll signify so much unto him straight.          Exit\n  BUCKINGHAM. Ah ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!\n    He is not lolling on a lewd love-bed,\n    But on his knees at meditation;\n    Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,\n    But meditating with two deep divines;\n    Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,\n    But praying, to enrich his watchful soul.\n    Happy were England would this virtuous prince\n    Take on his Grace the sovereignty thereof;\n    But, sure, I fear we shall not win him to it.\n  MAYOR. Marry, God defend his Grace should say us nay!\n  BUCKINGHAM. I fear he will. Here Catesby comes again.\n\n                          Re-enter CATESBY\n\n    Now, Catesby, what says his Grace?\n  CATESBY. My lord,\n    He wonders to what end you have assembled\n    Such troops of citizens to come to him. \n    His Grace not being warn'd thereof before,\n    He fears, my lord, you mean no good to him.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Sorry I am my noble cousin should\n    Suspect me that I mean no good to him.\n    By heaven, we come to him in perfect love;\n    And so once more return and tell his Grace.\n                                                    Exit CATESBY\n    When holy and devout religious men\n    Are at their beads, 'tis much to draw them thence,\n    So sweet is zealous contemplation.\n\n           Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two BISHOPS.\n                      CATESBY returns\n\n  MAYOR. See where his Grace stands 'tween two clergymen!\n  BUCKINGHAM. Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,\n    To stay him from the fall of vanity;\n    And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,\n    True ornaments to know a holy man.\n    Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince, \n    Lend favourable ear to our requests,\n    And pardon us the interruption\n    Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.\n  GLOUCESTER. My lord, there needs no such apology:\n    I do beseech your Grace to pardon me,\n    Who, earnest in the service of my God,\n    Deferr'd the visitation of my friends.\n    But, leaving this, what is your Grace's pleasure?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,\n    And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.\n  GLOUCESTER. I do suspect I have done some offence\n    That seems disgracious in the city's eye,\n    And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.\n  BUCKINGHAM. You have, my lord. Would it might please\n    your Grace,\n    On our entreaties, to amend your fault!\n  GLOUCESTER. Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Know then, it is your fault that you resign\n    The supreme seat, the throne majestical,\n    The scept'red office of your ancestors, \n    Your state of fortune and your due of birth,\n    The lineal glory of your royal house,\n    To the corruption of a blemish'd stock;\n    Whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,\n    Which here we waken to our country's good,\n    The noble isle doth want her proper limbs;\n    Her face defac'd with scars of infamy,\n    Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,\n    And almost should'red in the swallowing gulf\n    Of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion.\n    Which to recure, we heartily solicit\n    Your gracious self to take on you the charge\n    And kingly government of this your land-\n    Not as protector, steward, substitute,\n    Or lowly factor for another's gain;\n    But as successively, from blood to blood,\n    Your right of birth, your empery, your own.\n    For this, consorted with the citizens,\n    Your very worshipful and loving friends,\n    And by their vehement instigation, \n    In this just cause come I to move your Grace.\n  GLOUCESTER. I cannot tell if to depart in silence\n    Or bitterly to speak in your reproof\n    Best fitteth my degree or your condition.\n    If not to answer, you might haply think\n    Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded\n    To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,\n    Which fondly you would here impose on me;\n    If to reprove you for this suit of yours,\n    So season'd with your faithful love to me,\n    Then, on the other side, I check'd my friends.\n    Therefore-to speak, and to avoid the first,\n    And then, in speaking, not to incur the last-\n    Definitively thus I answer you:\n    Your love deserves my thanks, but my desert\n    Unmeritable shuns your high request.\n    First, if all obstacles were cut away,\n    And that my path were even to the crown,\n    As the ripe revenue and due of birth,\n    Yet so much is my poverty of spirit, \n    So mighty and so many my defects,\n    That I would rather hide me from my greatness-\n    Being a bark to brook no mighty sea-\n    Than in my greatness covet to be hid,\n    And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.\n    But, God be thank'd, there is no need of me-\n    And much I need to help you, were there need.\n    The royal tree hath left us royal fruit\n    Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,\n    Will well become the seat of majesty\n    And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.\n    On him I lay that you would lay on me-\n    The right and fortune of his happy stars,\n    Which God defend that I should wring from him.\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, this argues conscience in your\n    Grace;\n    But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,\n    All circumstances well considered.\n    You say that Edward is your brother's son.\n    So say we too, but not by Edward's wife; \n    For first was he contract to Lady Lucy-\n    Your mother lives a witness to his vow-\n    And afterward by substitute betroth'd\n    To Bona, sister to the King of France.\n    These both put off, a poor petitioner,\n    A care-craz'd mother to a many sons,\n    A beauty-waning and distressed widow,\n    Even in the afternoon of her best days,\n    Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye,\n    Seduc'd the pitch and height of his degree\n    To base declension and loath'd bigamy.\n    By her, in his unlawful bed, he got\n    This Edward, whom our manners call the Prince.\n    More bitterly could I expostulate,\n    Save that, for reverence to some alive,\n    I give a sparing limit to my tongue.\n    Then, good my lord, take to your royal self\n    This proffer'd benefit of dignity;\n    If not to bless us and the land withal,\n    Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry \n    From the corruption of abusing times\n    Unto a lineal true-derived course.\n  MAYOR. Do, good my lord; your citizens entreat you.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.\n  CATESBY. O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!\n  GLOUCESTER. Alas, why would you heap this care on me?\n    I am unfit for state and majesty.\n    I do beseech you, take it not amiss:\n    I cannot nor I will not yield to you.\n  BUCKINGHAM. If you refuse it-as, in love and zeal,\n    Loath to depose the child, your brother's son;\n    As well we know your tenderness of heart\n    And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,\n    Which we have noted in you to your kindred\n    And egally indeed to all estates-\n    Yet know, whe'er you accept our suit or no,\n    Your brother's son shall never reign our king;\n    But we will plant some other in the throne\n    To the disgrace and downfall of your house;\n    And in this resolution here we leave you. \n    Come, citizens. Zounds, I'll entreat no more.\n  GLOUCESTER. O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.\n                          Exeunt BUCKINGHAM, MAYOR, and citizens\n  CATESBY. Call him again, sweet Prince, accept their suit.\n    If you deny them, all the land will rue it.\n  GLOUCESTER. Will you enforce me to a world of cares?\n    Call them again. I am not made of stones,\n    But penetrable to your kind entreaties,\n    Albeit against my conscience and my soul.\n\n                  Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest\n\n    Cousin of Buckingham, and sage grave men,\n    Since you will buckle fortune on my back,\n    To bear her burden, whe'er I will or no,\n    I must have patience to endure the load;\n    But if black scandal or foul-fac'd reproach\n    Attend the sequel of your imposition,\n    Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me\n    From all the impure blots and stains thereof; \n    For God doth know, and you may partly see,\n    How far I am from the desire of this.\n  MAYOR. God bless your Grace! We see it, and will say it.\n  GLOUCESTER. In saying so, you shall but say the truth.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Then I salute you with this royal title-\n    Long live King Richard, England's worthy King!\n  ALL. Amen.\n  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow may it please you to be crown'd?\n  GLOUCESTER. Even when you please, for you will have it so.\n  BUCKINGHAM. To-morrow, then, we will attend your Grace;\n    And so, most joyfully, we take our leave.\n  GLOUCESTER.  [To the BISHOPS]  Come, let us to our holy\n    work again.\n    Farewell, my cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

Before the Tower\n\nEnter QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS of YORK, and MARQUIS of DORSET, at\none door;\nANNE, DUCHESS of GLOUCESTER, leading LADY MARGARET PLANTAGENET,\nCLARENCE's young daughter, at another door\n\n  DUCHESS. Who meets us here? My niece Plantagenet,\n    Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?\n    Now, for my life, she's wand'ring to the Tower,\n    On pure heart's love, to greet the tender Princes.\n    Daughter, well met.\n  ANNE. God give your Graces both\n    A happy and a joyful time of day!\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As much to you, good sister! Whither\n    away?\n  ANNE. No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,\n    Upon the like devotion as yourselves,\n    To gratulate the gentle Princes there.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Kind sister, thanks; we'll enter \n    all together.\n\n                       Enter BRAKENBURY\n\n    And in good time, here the lieutenant comes.\n    Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,\n    How doth the Prince, and my young son of York?\n  BRAKENBURY. Right well, dear madam. By your patience,\n    I may not suffer you to visit them.\n    The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The King! Who's that?\n  BRAKENBURY. I mean the Lord Protector.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. The Lord protect him from that kingly\n    title!\n    Hath he set bounds between their love and me?\n    I am their mother; who shall bar me from them?\n  DUCHESS. I am their father's mother; I will see them.\n  ANNE. Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother.\n    Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame,\n    And take thy office from thee on my peril. \n  BRAKENBURY. No, madam, no. I may not leave it so;\n    I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.            Exit\n\n                         Enter STANLEY\n\n  STANLEY. Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,\n    And I'll salute your Grace of York as mother\n    And reverend looker-on of two fair queens.\n    [To ANNE]  Come, madam, you must straight to\n    Westminster,\n    There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, cut my lace asunder\n    That my pent heart may have some scope to beat,\n    Or else I swoon with this dead-killing news!\n  ANNE. Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!\n  DORSET. Be of good cheer; mother, how fares your Grace?\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee\n    gone!\n    Death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;\n    Thy mother's name is ominous to children. \n    If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,\n    And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell.\n    Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,\n    Lest thou increase the number of the dead,\n    And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,\n    Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.\n  STANLEY. Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.\n    Take all the swift advantage of the hours;\n    You shall have letters from me to my son\n    In your behalf, to meet you on the way.\n    Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.\n  DUCHESS. O ill-dispersing wind of misery!\n    O my accursed womb, the bed of death!\n    A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,\n    Whose unavoided eye is murderous.\n  STANLEY. Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.\n  ANNE. And I with all unwillingness will go.\n    O, would to God that the inclusive verge\n    Of golden metal that must round my brow\n    Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brains! \n    Anointed let me be with deadly venom,\n    And die ere men can say 'God save the Queen!'\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Go, go, poor soul; I envy not thy glory.\n    To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.\n  ANNE. No, why? When he that is my husband now\n    Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse;\n    When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands\n    Which issued from my other angel husband,\n    And that dear saint which then I weeping follow'd-\n    O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,\n    This was my wish: 'Be thou' quoth I 'accurs'd\n    For making me, so young, so old a widow;\n    And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;\n    And be thy wife, if any be so mad,\n    More miserable by the life of thee\n    Than thou hast made me by my dear lord's death.'\n    Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,\n    Within so small a time, my woman's heart\n    Grossly grew captive to his honey words\n    And prov'd the subject of mine own soul's curse, \n    Which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest;\n    For never yet one hour in his bed\n    Did I enjoy the golden dew of sleep,\n    But with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.\n    Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;\n    And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.\n  ANNE. No more than with my soul I mourn for yours.\n  DORSET. Farewell, thou woeful welcomer of glory!\n  ANNE. Adieu, poor soul, that tak'st thy leave of it!\n  DUCHESS.  [To DORSET]  Go thou to Richmond, and good\n    fortune guide thee!\n    [To ANNE]  Go thou to Richard, and good angels tend\n    thee!  [To QUEEN ELIZABETH]  Go thou to sanctuary, and good\n    thoughts possess thee!\n    I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!\n    Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,\n    And each hour's joy wreck'd with a week of teen.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Stay, yet look back with me unto the\n    Tower. \n    Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes\n    Whom envy hath immur'd within your walls,\n    Rough cradle for such little pretty ones.\n    Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow\n    For tender princes, use my babies well.\n    So foolish sorrows bids your stones farewell.         Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 2.\n\nLondon. The palace\n\nSound a sennet. Enter RICHARD, in pomp, as KING; BUCKINGHAM,\nCATESBY,\nRATCLIFF, LOVEL, a PAGE, and others\n\n  KING RICHARD. Stand all apart.

Sound]\n    Thus high, by thy advice\n    And thy assistance, is King Richard seated.\n    But shall we wear these glories for a day;\n    Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Still live they, and for ever let them last!\n  KING RICHARD. Ah, Buckingham, now do I play the touch,\n    To try if thou be current gold indeed.\n    Young Edward lives-think now what I would speak.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Say on, my loving lord.\n  KING RICHARD. Why, Buckingham, I say I would be King.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Why, so you are, my thrice-renowned lord. \n  KING RICHARD. Ha! am I King? 'Tis so; but Edward lives.\n  BUCKINGHAM. True, noble Prince.\n  KING RICHARD. O bitter consequence:\n    That Edward still should live-true noble Prince!\n    Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull.\n    Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead.\n    And I would have it suddenly perform'd.\n    What say'st thou now? Speak suddenly, be brief.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Your Grace may do your pleasure.\n  KING RICHARD. Tut, tut, thou art all ice; thy kindness freezes.\n    Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Give me some little breath, some pause,\n    dear Lord,\n    Before I positively speak in this.\n    I will resolve you herein presently.                    Exit\n  CATESBY.  [Aside to another]  The King is angry; see, he\n    gnaws his lip.\n  KING RICHARD. I will converse with iron-witted fools\n                                      [Descends from the throne]\n    And unrespective boys; none are for me \n    That look into me with considerate eyes.\n    High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.\n    Boy!\n  PAGE.

I know a discontented gentleman\n    Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit.\n    Gold were as good as twenty orators,\n    And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything.\n  KING RICHARD. What is his name?\n  PAGE. His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.\n  KING RICHARD. I partly know the man. Go, call him hither,\n    boy.                                               Exit PAGE\n    The deep-revolving witty Buckingham\n    No more shall be the neighbour to my counsels.\n    Hath he so long held out with me, untir'd,\n    And stops he now for breath?

Know, my loving lord,\n    The Marquis Dorset, as I hear, is fled\n    To Richmond, in the parts where he abides.    [Stands apart]\n  KING RICHARD. Come hither, Catesby. Rumour it abroad\n    That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick;\n    I will take order for her keeping close.\n    Inquire me out some mean poor gentleman,\n    Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter-\n    The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.\n    Look how thou dream'st! I say again, give out\n    That Anne, my queen, is sick and like to die.\n    About it; for it stands me much upon\n    To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.\n                                                    Exit CATESBY\n    I must be married to my brother's daughter,\n    Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.\n    Murder her brothers, and then marry her! \n    Uncertain way of gain! But I am in\n    So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin.\n    Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.\n\n                     Re-enter PAGE, with TYRREL\n\n    Is thy name Tyrrel?\n  TYRREL.

Please you;\n    But I had rather kill two enemies.\n  KING RICHARD. Why, then thou hast it. Two deep enemies,\n    Foes to my rest, and my sweet sleep's disturbers,\n    Are they that I would have thee deal upon.\n  TYRREL, I mean those bastards in the Tower.\n  TYRREL. Let me have open means to come to them,\n    And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.\n  KING RICHARD. Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come \n    hither, Tyrrel.\n    Go, by this token. Rise, and lend thine ear.      [Whispers]\n    There is no more but so: say it is done,\n    And I will love thee and prefer thee for it.\n  TYRREL. I will dispatch it straight.                      Exit\n\n                    Re-enter BUCKINGHAM\n\n    BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I have consider'd in my mind\n    The late request that you did sound me in.\n  KING RICHARD. Well, let that rest. Dorset is fled to\n    Richmond.\n  BUCKINGHAM. I hear the news, my lord.\n  KING RICHARD. Stanley, he is your wife's son: well, look\n    unto it.\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise,\n    For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd:\n    Th' earldom of Hereford and the movables\n    Which you have promised I shall possess.\n  KING RICHARD. Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey \n    Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.\n  BUCKINGHAM. What says your Highness to my just request?\n  KING RICHARD. I do remember me: Henry the Sixth\n    Did prophesy that Richmond should be King,\n    When Richmond was a little peevish boy.\n    A king!-perhaps-\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-\n  KING RICHARD. How chance the prophet could not at that\n    time\n    Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord, your promise for the earldom-\n  KING RICHARD. Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,\n    The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle\n    And call'd it Rugemount, at which name I started,\n    Because a bard of Ireland told me once\n    I should not live long after I saw Richmond.\n  BUCKINGHAM. My lord-\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, what's o'clock?\n  BUCKINGHAM. I am thus bold to put your Grace in mind\n    Of what you promis'd me. \n  KING RICHARD. Well, but o'clock?\n  BUCKINGHAM. Upon the stroke of ten.\n  KING RICHARD. Well, let it strike.\n  BUCKINGHAM. Why let it strike?\n  KING RICHARD. Because that like a Jack thou keep'st the\n    stroke\n    Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.\n    I am not in the giving vein to-day.\n  BUCKINGHAM. May it please you to resolve me in my suit.\n  KING RICHARD. Thou troublest me; I am not in the vein.\n                                       Exeunt all but Buckingham\n  BUCKINGHAM. And is it thus? Repays he my deep service\n    With such contempt? Made I him King for this?\n    O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone\n    To Brecknock while my fearful head is on!               Exit\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 3.\n\nLondon. The palace\n\nEnter TYRREL\n\n  TYRREL. The tyrannous and bloody act is done,\n    The most arch deed of piteous massacre\n    That ever yet this land was guilty of.\n    Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborn\n    To do this piece of ruthless butchery,\n    Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,\n    Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,\n    Wept like two children in their deaths' sad story.\n    'O, thus' quoth Dighton 'lay the gentle babes'-\n    'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest 'girdling one another\n    Within their alabaster innocent arms.\n    Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,\n    And in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.\n    A book of prayers on their pillow lay;\n    Which once,' quoth Forrest 'almost chang'd my mind;\n    But, O, the devil'-there the villain stopp'd;\n    When Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered \n    The most replenished sweet work of nature\n    That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'\n    Hence both are gone with conscience and remorse\n    They could not speak; and so I left them both,\n    To bear this tidings to the bloody King.\n\n                        Enter KING RICHARD\n\n    And here he comes. All health, my sovereign lord!\n  KING RICHARD. Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?\n  TYRREL. If to have done the thing you gave in charge\n    Beget your happiness, be happy then,\n    For it is done.\n  KING RICHARD. But didst thou see them dead?\n  TYRREL. I did, my lord.\n  KING RICHARD. And buried, gentle Tyrrel?\n  TYRREL. The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;\n    But where, to say the truth, I do not know.\n  KING RICHARD. Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,\n    When thou shalt tell the process of their death. \n    Meantime, but think how I may do thee good\n    And be inheritor of thy desire.\n    Farewell till then.\n  TYRREL.

The son of Clarence have I pent up close;\n    His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;\n    The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,\n    And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night.\n    Now, for I know the Britaine Richmond aims\n    At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,\n    And by that knot looks proudly on the crown,\n    To her go I, a jolly thriving wooer.\n\n                           Enter RATCLIFF\n\n  RATCLIFF. My lord!\n  KING RICHARD. Good or bad news, that thou com'st in so\n    bluntly?\n  RATCLIFF. Bad news, my lord: Morton is fled to Richmond;\n    And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen, \n    Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.\n  KING RICHARD. Ely with Richmond troubles me more near\n    Than Buckingham and his rash-levied strength.\n    Come, I have learn'd that fearful commenting\n    Is leaden servitor to dull delay;\n    Delay leads impotent and snail-pac'd beggary.\n    Then fiery expedition be my wing,\n    Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!\n    Go, muster men. My counsel is my shield.\n    We must be brief when traitors brave the field.       Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE 4.\n\nLondon. Before the palace\n\nEnter old QUEEN MARGARET\n\n  QUEEN MARGARET. So now prosperity begins to mellow\n    And drop into the rotten mouth of death.\n    Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd\n    To watch the waning of mine enemies.\n    A dire induction am I witness to,\n    And will to France, hoping the consequence\n    Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.\n    Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret. Who comes here?\n                                                       [Retires]\n\n           Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK\n\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, my poor princes! ah, my tender\n    babes!\n    My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!\n    If yet your gentle souls fly in the air\n    And be not fix'd in doom perpetual, \n    Hover about me with your airy wings\n    And hear your mother's lamentation.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Hover about her; say that right for right\n    Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.\n  DUCHESS. So many miseries have craz'd my voice\n    That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute.\n    Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet,\n    Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle\n    lambs\n    And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?\n    When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?\n  QUEEN MARGARET. When holy Harry died, and my sweet\n    son.\n  DUCHESS. Dead life, blind sight, poor mortal living ghost,\n    Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,\n    Brief abstract and record of tedious days,\n    Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,    [Sitting down]\n    Unlawfully made drunk with innocent blood. \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Ah, that thou wouldst as soon afford a\n    grave\n    As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!\n    Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.\n    Ah, who hath any cause to mourn but we?\n                                           [Sitting down by her]\n  QUEEN MARGARET.  [Coming forward]  If ancient sorrow be\n    most reverend,\n    Give mine the benefit of seniory,\n    And let my griefs frown on the upper hand.\n    If sorrow can admit society,        [Sitting down with them]\n    Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine.\n    I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;\n    I had a husband, till a Richard kill'd him:\n    Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;\n    Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him.\n  DUCHESS. I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;\n    I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard\n    kill'd him. \n    From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept\n    A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death.\n    That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes\n    To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,\n    That foul defacer of God's handiwork,\n    That excellent grand tyrant of the earth\n    That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,\n    Thy womb let loose to chase us to our graves.\n    O upright, just, and true-disposing God,\n    How do I thank thee that this carnal cur\n    Preys on the issue of his mother's body\n    And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!\n  DUCHESS. O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!\n    God witness with me, I have wept for thine.\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,\n    And now I cloy me with beholding it.\n    Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward;\n    The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;\n    Young York he is but boot, because both they\n    Match'd not the high perfection of my loss. \n    Thy Clarence he is dead that stabb'd my Edward;\n    And the beholders of this frantic play,\n    Th' adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,\n    Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.\n    Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer;\n    Only reserv'd their factor to buy souls\n    And send them thither. But at hand, at hand,\n    Ensues his piteous and unpitied end.\n    Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray,\n    To have him suddenly convey'd from hence.\n    Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I pray,\n    That I may live and say 'The dog is dead.'\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, thou didst prophesy the time would\n      come\n    That I should wish for thee to help me curse\n    That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!\n  QUEEN MARGARET. I Call'd thee then vain flourish of my\n      fortune;\n    I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen,\n    The presentation of but what I was, \n    The flattering index of a direful pageant,\n    One heav'd a-high to be hurl'd down below,\n    A mother only mock'd with two fair babes,\n    A dream of what thou wast, a garish flag\n    To be the aim of every dangerous shot,\n    A sign of dignity, a breath, a bubble,\n    A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.\n    Where is thy husband now? Where be thy brothers?\n    Where be thy two sons? Wherein dost thou joy?\n    Who sues, and kneels, and says 'God save the Queen'?\n    Where be the bending peers that flattered thee?\n    Where be the thronging troops that followed thee?\n    Decline an this, and see what now thou art:\n    For happy wife, a most distressed widow;\n    For joyful mother, one that wails the name;\n    For one being su'd to, one that humbly sues;\n    For Queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;\n    For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;\n    For she being fear'd of all, now fearing one;\n    For she commanding all, obey'd of none. \n    Thus hath the course of justice whirl'd about\n    And left thee but a very prey to time,\n    Having no more but thought of what thou wast\n    To torture thee the more, being what thou art.\n    Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not\n    Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?\n    Now thy proud neck bears half my burden'd yoke,\n    From which even here I slip my weary head\n    And leave the burden of it all on thee.\n    Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance;\n    These English woes shall make me smile in France.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile\n    And teach me how to curse mine enemies!\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the\n      days;\n    Compare dead happiness with living woe;\n    Think that thy babes were sweeter than they were,\n    And he that slew them fouler than he is.\n    Bett'ring thy loss makes the bad-causer worse;\n    Revolving this will teach thee how to curse. \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My words are dull; O, quicken them\n    with thine!\n  QUEEN MARGARET. Thy woes will make them sharp and\n    pierce like mine.                                       Exit\n  DUCHESS. Why should calamity be fun of words?\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Windy attorneys to their client woes,\n    Airy succeeders of intestate joys,\n    Poor breathing orators of miseries,\n    Let them have scope; though what they will impart\n    Help nothing else, yet do they case the heart.\n  DUCHESS. If so, then be not tongue-tied. Go with me,\n    And in the breath of bitter words let's smother\n    My damned son that thy two sweet sons smother'd.\n    The trumpet sounds; be copious in exclaims.\n\n         Enter KING RICHARD and his train, marching with\n                     drums and trumpets\n\n  KING RICHARD. Who intercepts me in my expedition?\n  DUCHESS. O, she that might have intercepted thee, \n    By strangling thee in her accursed womb,\n    From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Hidest thou that forehead with a golden\n    crown\n    Where't should be branded, if that right were right,\n    The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that crown,\n    And the dire death of my poor sons and brothers?\n    Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?\n  DUCHESS. Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother\n    Clarence?\n    And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Where is the gentle Rivers, Vaughan,\n    Grey?\n  DUCHESS. Where is kind Hastings?\n  KING RICHARD. A flourish, trumpets! Strike alarum, drums!\n    Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women\n    Rail on the Lord's anointed. Strike, I say!\n                                             [Flourish. Alarums]\n    Either be patient and entreat me fair,\n    Or with the clamorous report of war \n    Thus will I drown your exclamations.\n  DUCHESS. Art thou my son?\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.\n  DUCHESS. Then patiently hear my impatience.\n  KING RICHARD. Madam, I have a touch of your condition\n    That cannot brook the accent of reproof.\n  DUCHESS. O, let me speak!\n  KING RICHARD. Do, then; but I'll not hear.\n  DUCHESS. I will be mild and gentle in my words.\n  KING RICHARD. And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.\n  DUCHESS. Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,\n    God knows, in torment and in agony.\n  KING RICHARD. And came I not at last to comfort you?\n  DUCHESS. No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well\n    Thou cam'st on earth to make the earth my hell.\n    A grievous burden was thy birth to me;\n    Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;\n    Thy school-days frightful, desp'rate, wild, and furious;\n    Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous;\n    Thy age confirm'd, proud, subtle, sly, and bloody, \n    More mild, but yet more harmful-kind in hatred.\n    What comfortable hour canst thou name\n    That ever grac'd me with thy company?\n  KING RICHARD. Faith, none but Humphrey Hour, that call'd\n    your Grace\n    To breakfast once forth of my company.\n    If I be so disgracious in your eye,\n    Let me march on and not offend you, madam.\n    Strike up the drum.\n  DUCHESS. I prithee hear me speak.\n  KING RICHARD. You speak too bitterly.\n  DUCHESS. Hear me a word;\n    For I shall never speak to thee again.\n  KING RICHARD. So.\n  DUCHESS. Either thou wilt die by God's just ordinance\n    Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror;\n    Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish\n    And never more behold thy face again.\n    Therefore take with thee my most grievous curse,\n    Which in the day of battle tire thee more \n    Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!\n    My prayers on the adverse party fight;\n    And there the little souls of Edward's children\n    Whisper the spirits of thine enemies\n    And promise them success and victory.\n    Bloody thou art; bloody will be thy end.\n    Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.        Exit\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Though far more cause, yet much less\n      spirit to curse\n    Abides in me; I say amen to her.\n  KING RICHARD. Stay, madam, I must talk a word with you.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I have no moe sons of the royal blood\n    For thee to slaughter. For my daughters, Richard,\n    They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;\n    And therefore level not to hit their lives.\n  KING RICHARD. You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth.\n    Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And must she die for this? O, let her\n      live,\n    And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty, \n    Slander myself as false to Edward's bed,\n    Throw over her the veil of infamy;\n    So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,\n    I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.\n  KING RICHARD. Wrong not her birth; she is a royal\n    Princess.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To save her life I'll say she is not so.\n  KING RICHARD. Her life is safest only in her birth.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And only in that safety died her\n      brothers.\n  KING RICHARD. Lo, at their birth good stars were opposite.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. No, to their lives ill friends were\n      contrary.\n  KING RICHARD. All unavoided is the doom of destiny.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. True, when avoided grace makes destiny.\n    My babes were destin'd to a fairer death,\n    If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.\n  KING RICHARD. You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle\n      cozen'd \n    Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.\n    Whose hand soever lanc'd their tender hearts,\n    Thy head, an indirectly, gave direction.\n    No doubt the murd'rous knife was dull and blunt\n    Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart\n    To revel in the entrails of my lambs.\n    But that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame,\n    My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys\n    Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;\n    And I, in such a desp'rate bay of death,\n    Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,\n    Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.\n  KING RICHARD. Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise\n    And dangerous success of bloody wars,\n    As I intend more good to you and yours\n    Than ever you or yours by me were harm'd!\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What good is cover'd with the face of\n      heaven,\n    To be discover'd, that can do me good?\n  KING RICHARD. advancement of your children, gentle \n    lady.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Up to some scaffold, there to lose their\n    heads?\n  KING RICHARD. Unto the dignity and height of Fortune,\n    The high imperial type of this earth's glory.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Flatter my sorrow with report of it;\n    Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,\n    Canst thou demise to any child of mine?\n  KING RICHARD. Even all I have-ay, and myself and all\n    Will I withal endow a child of thine;\n    So in the Lethe of thy angry soul\n    Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs\n    Which thou supposest I have done to thee.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Be brief, lest that the process of thy\n      kindness\n    Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.\n  KING RICHARD. Then know, that from my soul I love thy\n    daughter.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. My daughter's mother thinks it with her\n    soul. \n  KING RICHARD. What do you think?\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou dost love my daughter from\n      thy soul.\n    So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers,\n    And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.\n  KING RICHARD. Be not so hasty to confound my meaning.\n    I mean that with my soul I love thy daughter\n    And do intend to make her Queen of England.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Well, then, who dost thou mean shall be\n    her king?\n  KING RICHARD. Even he that makes her Queen. Who else\n    should be?\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What, thou?\n  KING RICHARD. Even so. How think you of it?\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. How canst thou woo her?\n  KING RICHARD. That would I learn of you,\n    As one being best acquainted with her humour.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. And wilt thou learn of me?\n  KING RICHARD. Madam, with all my heart.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Send to her, by the man that slew her \n    brothers,\n    A pair of bleeding hearts; thereon engrave\n    'Edward' and 'York.' Then haply will she weep;\n    Therefore present to her-as sometimes Margaret\n    Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood-\n    A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain\n    The purple sap from her sweet brother's body,\n    And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal.\n    If this inducement move her not to love,\n    Send her a letter of thy noble deeds;\n    Tell her thou mad'st away her uncle Clarence,\n    Her uncle Rivers; ay, and for her sake\n    Mad'st quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.\n  KING RICHARD. You mock me, madam; this is not the way\n    To win your daughter.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. There is no other way;\n    Unless thou couldst put on some other shape\n    And not be Richard that hath done all this.\n  KING RICHARD. Say that I did all this for love of her.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but \n      hate thee,\n    Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.\n  KING RICHARD. Look what is done cannot be now amended.\n    Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,\n    Which after-hours gives leisure to repent.\n    If I did take the kingdom from your sons,\n    To make amends I'll give it to your daughter.\n    If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,\n    To quicken your increase I will beget\n    Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter.\n    A grandam's name is little less in love\n    Than is the doating title of a mother;\n    They are as children but one step below,\n    Even of your metal, of your very blood;\n    Of all one pain, save for a night of groans\n    Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.\n    Your children were vexation to your youth;\n    But mine shall be a comfort to your age.\n    The loss you have is but a son being King,\n    And by that loss your daughter is made Queen. \n    I cannot make you what amends I would,\n    Therefore accept such kindness as I can.\n    Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul\n    Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,\n    This fair alliance quickly shall can home\n    To high promotions and great dignity.\n    The King, that calls your beauteous daughter wife,\n    Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;\n    Again shall you be mother to a king,\n    And all the ruins of distressful times\n    Repair'd with double riches of content.\n    What! we have many goodly days to see.\n    The liquid drops of tears that you have shed\n    Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,\n    Advantaging their loan with interest\n    Of ten times double gain of happiness.\n    Go, then, my mother, to thy daughter go;\n    Make bold her bashful years with your experience;\n    Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale;\n    Put in her tender heart th' aspiring flame \n    Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the Princes\n    With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys.\n    And when this arm of mine hath chastised\n    The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,\n    Bound with triumphant garlands will I come,\n    And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;\n    To whom I will retail my conquest won,\n    And she shall be sole victoress, Caesar's Caesar.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. What were I best to say? Her father's\n      brother\n    Would be her lord? Or shall I say her uncle?\n    Or he that slew her brothers and her uncles?\n    Under what title shall I woo for thee\n    That God, the law, my honour, and her love\n    Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?\n  KING RICHARD. Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Which she shall purchase with\n    still-lasting war.\n  KING RICHARD. Tell her the King, that may command,\n    entreats. \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That at her hands which the King's\n    King forbids.\n  KING RICHARD. Say she shall be a high and mighty queen.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. To wail the title, as her mother doth.\n  KING RICHARD. Say I will love her everlastingly.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long shall that title 'ever' last?\n  KING RICHARD. Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But how long fairly shall her sweet life\n    last?\n  KING RICHARD. As long as heaven and nature lengthens it.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. As long as hell and Richard likes of it.\n  KING RICHARD. Say I, her sovereign, am her subject low.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. But she, your subject, loathes such\n    sovereignty.\n  KING RICHARD. Be eloquent in my behalf to her.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. An honest tale speeds best being plainly\n    told.\n  KING RICHARD. Then plainly to her tell my loving tale.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.\n  KING RICHARD. Your reasons are too shallow and too quick. \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. O, no, my reasons are too deep and\n      dead-\n    Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their graves.\n  KING RICHARD. Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Harp on it still shall I till heartstrings\n    break.\n  KING RICHARD. Now, by my George, my garter, and my\n    crown-\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Profan'd, dishonour'd, and the third\n    usurp'd.\n  KING RICHARD. I swear-\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. By nothing; for this is no oath:\n    Thy George, profan'd, hath lost his lordly honour;\n    Thy garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;\n    Thy crown, usurp'd, disgrac'd his kingly glory.\n    If something thou wouldst swear to be believ'd,\n    Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.\n  KING RICHARD. Then, by my self-\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy self is self-misus'd.\n  KING RICHARD. Now, by the world- \n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. 'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.\n  KING RICHARD. My father's death-\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Thy life hath it dishonour'd.\n  KING RICHARD. Why, then, by God-\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. God's wrong is most of all.\n    If thou didst fear to break an oath with Him,\n    The unity the King my husband made\n    Thou hadst not broken, nor my brothers died.\n    If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,\n    Th' imperial metal, circling now thy head,\n    Had grac'd the tender temples of my child;\n    And both the Princes had been breathing here,\n    Which now, two tender bedfellows for dust,\n    Thy broken faith hath made the prey for worms.\n    What canst thou swear by now?\n  KING RICHARD. The time to come.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. That thou hast wronged in the time\n    o'erpast;\n    For I myself have many tears to wash\n    Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee. \n    The children live whose fathers thou hast slaughter'd,\n    Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;\n    The parents live whose children thou hast butcheed,\n    Old barren plants, to wail it with their age.\n    Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast\n    Misus'd ere us'd, by times ill-us'd o'erpast.\n  KING RICHARD. As I intend to prosper and repent,\n    So thrive I in my dangerous affairs\n    Of hostile arms! Myself myself confound!\n    Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!\n    Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!\n    Be opposite all planets of good luck\n    To my proceeding!-if, with dear heart's love,\n    Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,\n    I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter.\n    In her consists my happiness and thine;\n    Without her, follows to myself and thee,\n    Herself, the land, and many a Christian soul,\n    Death, desolation, ruin, and decay.\n    It cannot be avoided but by this; \n    It will not be avoided but by this.\n    Therefore, dear mother-I must call you so-\n    Be the attorney of my love to her;\n    Plead what I will be, not what I have been;\n    Not my deserts, but what I will deserve.\n    Urge the necessity and state of times,\n    And be not peevish-fond in great designs.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, if the devil tempt you to do good.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I forget myself to be myself?\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, if your self's remembrance wrong\n    yourself.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Yet thou didst kill my children.\n  KING RICHARD. But in your daughter's womb I bury them;\n    Where, in that nest of spicery, they will breed\n    Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?\n  KING RICHARD. And be a happy mother by the deed.\n  QUEEN ELIZABETH. I go. Write to me very shortly,\n    And you shall understand from me her mind. \n  KING RICHARD. Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.\n                               Kissing her. Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH\n    Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!\n\n                 Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following\n\n    How now! what news?\n  RATCLIFF. Most mighty sovereign, on the western coast\n    Rideth a puissant navy; to our shores\n    Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,\n    Unarm'd, and unresolv'd to beat them back.\n    'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;\n    And there they hull, expecting but the aid\n    Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.\n  KING RICHARD. Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of\n    Norfolk.\n    Ratcliff, thyself-or Catesby; where is he?\n  CATESBY. Here, my good lord.\n  KING RICHARD. Catesby, fly to the Duke.\n  CATESBY. I will my lord, with all convenient haste. \n  KING RICHARD. Ratcliff, come hither. Post to Salisbury;\n    When thou com'st thither-  [To CATESBY]  Dull,\n    unmindfull villain,\n    Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke?\n  CATESBY. First, mighty liege, tell me your Highness' pleasure,\n    What from your Grace I shall deliver to him.\n  KING RICHARD. O, true, good Catesby. Bid him levy straight\n    The greatest strength and power that he can make\n    And meet me suddenly at Salisbury.\n  CATESBY. I go.                                            Exit\n  RATCLIFF. What, may it please you, shall I do at Salisbury?\n  KING RICHARD. Why, what wouldst thou do there before I\n    go?\n  RATCLIFF. Your Highness told me I should post before.\n  KING RICHARD. My mind is chang'd.\n\n                           Enter LORD STANLEY\n\n  STANLEY, what news with you?\n  STANLEY. None good, my liege, to please you with \n    the hearing;\n    Nor none so bad but well may be reported.\n  KING RICHARD. Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!\n    What need'st thou run so many miles about,\n    When thou mayest tell thy tale the nearest way?\n    Once more, what news?\n  STANLEY. Richmond is on the seas.\n  KING RICHARD. There let him sink, and be the seas on him!\n    White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?\n  STANLEY. I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.\n  KING RICHARD. Well, as you guess?\n  STANLEY. Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton,\n    He makes for England here to claim the crown.\n  KING RICHARD. Is the chair empty? Is the sword unsway'd?\n    Is the King dead, the empire unpossess'd?\n    What heir of York is there alive but we?\n    And who is England's King but great York's heir?\n    Then tell me what makes he upon the seas.\n  STANLEY. Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.\n  KING RICHARD. Unless for that he comes to be your liege, \n    You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.\n    Thou wilt revolt and fly to him, I fear.\n  STANLEY. No, my good lord; therefore mistrust me not.\n  KING RICHARD. Where is thy power then, to beat him back?\n    Where be thy tenants and thy followers?\n    Are they not now upon the western shore,\n    Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships?\n  STANLEY. No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.\n  KING RICHARD. Cold friends to me. What do they in the\n    north,\n    When they should serve their sovereign in the west?\n  STANLEY. They have not been commanded, mighty King.\n    Pleaseth your Majesty to give me leave,\n    I'll muster up my friends and meet your Grace\n    Where and what time your Majesty shall please.\n  KING RICHARD. Ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with\n    Richmond;\n    But I'll not trust thee.\n  STANLEY. Most mighty sovereign,\n    You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful. \n    I never was nor never will be false.\n  KING RICHARD. Go, then, and muster men. But leave behind\n    Your son, George Stanley. Look your heart be firm,\n    Or else his head's assurance is but frail.\n  STANLEY. So deal with him as I prove true to you.

The news I have to tell your Majesty\n    Is that by sudden floods and fall of waters\n    Buckingham's army is dispers'd and scatter'd;\n    And he himself wand'red away alone,\n    No man knows whither.\n  KING RICHARD. I cry thee mercy.\n    There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.\n    Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd\n    Reward to him that brings the traitor in?\n  THIRD MESSENGER. Such proclamation hath been made,\n    my Lord.\n\n                      Enter another MESSENGER \n\n  FOURTH MESSENGER.

My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken- \n    That is the best news.

Unless I have mista'en his colours much-\n    Which well I am assur'd I have not done-\n    His regiment lies half a mile at least\n    South from the mighty power of the King.\n  RICHMOND. If without peril it be possible,\n    Sweet Blunt, make some good means to speak with him\n    And give him from me this most needful note.\n  BLUNT. Upon my life, my lord, I'll undertake it;\n    And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!\n  RICHMOND. Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come,\n    gentlemen,\n    Let us consult upon to-morrow's business.\n    In to my tent; the dew is raw and cold. \n                                   [They withdraw into the tent]\n\n            Enter, to his-tent, KING RICHARD, NORFOLK,\n                       RATCLIFF, and CATESBY\n\n  KING RICHARD. What is't o'clock?\n  CATESBY. It's supper-time, my lord;\n    It's nine o'clock.\n  KING RICHARD. I will not sup to-night.\n    Give me some ink and paper.\n    What, is my beaver easier than it was?\n    And all my armour laid into my tent?\n  CATESBY. It is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.\n  KING RICHARD. Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;\n    Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.\n  NORFOLK. I go, my lord.\n  KING RICHARD. Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.\n  NORFOLK. I warrant you, my lord.                          Exit\n  KING RICHARD. Catesby!\n  CATESBY. My lord? \n  KING RICHARD. Send out a pursuivant-at-arms\n    To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power\n    Before sunrising, lest his son George fall\n    Into the blind cave of eternal night.           Exit CATESBY\n    Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.\n    Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.\n    Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.\n    Ratcliff!\n  RATCLIFF. My lord?\n  KING RICHARD. Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord\n    Northumberland?\n  RATCLIFF. Thomas the Earl of Surrey and himself,\n    Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop\n    Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.\n  KING RICHARD. So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine.\n    I have not that alacrity of spirit\n    Nor cheer of mind that I was wont to have.\n    Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?\n  RATCLIFF. It is, my lord.\n  KING RICHARD. Bid my guard watch; leave me. \n  RATCLIFF, about the mid of night come to my tent\n    And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.\n                                   Exit RATCLIFF. RICHARD sleeps\n\n               Enter DERBY to RICHMOND in his tent;\n                        LORDS attending\n\n  DERBY. Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!\n  RICHMOND. All comfort that the dark night can afford\n    Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!\n    Tell me, how fares our loving mother?\n  DERBY. I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n    Who prays continually for Richmond's good.\n    So much for that. The silent hours steal on,\n    And flaky darkness breaks within the east.\n    In brief, for so the season bids us be,\n    Prepare thy battle early in the morning,\n    And put thy fortune to the arbitrement\n    Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.\n    I, as I may-that which I would I cannot- \n    With best advantage will deceive the time\n    And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms;\n    But on thy side I may not be too forward,\n    Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,\n    Be executed in his father's sight.\n    Farewell; the leisure and the fearful time\n    Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love\n    And ample interchange of sweet discourse\n    Which so-long-sund'red friends should dwell upon.\n    God give us leisure for these rites of love!\n    Once more, adieu; be valiant, and speed well!\n  RICHMOND. Good lords, conduct him to his regiment.\n    I'll strive with troubled thoughts to take a nap,\n    Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow\n    When I should mount with wings of victory.\n    Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.\n                                         Exeunt all but RICHMOND\n    O Thou, whose captain I account myself,\n    Look on my forces with a gracious eye;\n    Put in their hands Thy bruising irons of wrath, \n    That they may crush down with a heavy fall\n    The usurping helmets of our adversaries!\n    Make us Thy ministers of chastisement,\n    That we may praise Thee in the victory!\n    To Thee I do commend my watchful soul\n    Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes.\n    Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

[To RICHARD]  When I was mortal, my anointed\n    body\n    By thee was punched full of deadly holes.\n    Think on the Tower and me. Despair, and die.\n    Harry the Sixth bids thee despair and die.\n    [To RICHMOND]  Virtuous and holy, be thou conqueror!\n    Harry, that prophesied thou shouldst be King,\n    Doth comfort thee in thy sleep. Live and flourish!\n\n                   Enter the GHOST of CLARENCE\n\n  GHOST.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy soul\n    to-morrow! I that was wash'd to death with fulsome wine,\n    Poor Clarence, by thy guile betray'd to death!\n    To-morrow in the battle think on me,\n    And fall thy edgeless sword. Despair and die!\n    [To RICHMOND]  Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster,\n    The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee. \n    Good angels guard thy battle! Live and flourish!\n\n           Enter the GHOSTS of RIVERS, GREY, and VAUGHAN\n\n  GHOST OF RIVERS.  [To RICHARD]  Let me sit heavy in thy\n    soul to-morrow,\n    Rivers that died at Pomfret! Despair and die!\n  GHOST OF GREY.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Grey, and let\n    thy soul despair!\n  GHOST OF VAUGHAN.  [To RICHARD]  Think upon Vaughan,\n    and with guilty fear\n    Let fall thy lance. Despair and die!\n  ALL.

[To RICHARD]  Bloody and guilty, guiltily awake,\n    And in a bloody battle end thy days! \n    Think on Lord Hastings. Despair and die.\n    [To RICHMOND]   Quiet untroubled soul, awake, awake!\n    Arm, fight, and conquer, for fair England's sake!\n\n         Enter the GHOSTS of the two young PRINCES\n\n  GHOSTS.

[To RICHARD]  Richard, thy wife, that wretched \n    Anne thy wife\n    That never slept a quiet hour with thee\n    Now fills thy sleep with perturbations.\n    To-morrow in the battle think on me,\n    And fall thy edgeless sword.

[To RICHARD]  The first was I that help'd thee\n    to the crown;\n    The last was I that felt thy tyranny.\n    O, in the battle think on Buckingham,\n    And die in terror of thy guiltiness!\n    Dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;\n    Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!\n    [To RICHMOND]  I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid;\n    But cheer thy heart and be thou not dismay'd: \n    God and good angels fight on Richmond's side;\n    And Richard falls in height of all his pride.\n            [The GHOSTS vanish. RICHARD starts out of his dream]\n  KING RICHARD. Give me another horse. Bind up my wounds.\n    Have mercy, Jesu! Soft! I did but dream.\n    O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!\n    The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.\n    Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.\n    What do I fear? Myself? There's none else by.\n    Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.\n    Is there a murderer here? No-yes, I am.\n    Then fly. What, from myself? Great reason why-\n    Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself!\n    Alack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good\n    That I myself have done unto myself?\n    O, no! Alas, I rather hate myself\n    For hateful deeds committed by myself!\n    I am a villain; yet I lie, I am not.\n    Fool, of thyself speak well. Fool, do not flatter.\n    My conscience hath a thousand several tongues, \n    And every tongue brings in a several tale,\n    And every tale condemns me for a villain.\n    Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;\n    Murder, stern murder, in the dir'st degree;\n    All several sins, all us'd in each degree,\n    Throng to the bar, crying all 'Guilty! guilty!'\n    I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;\n    And if I die no soul will pity me:\n    And wherefore should they, since that I myself\n    Find in myself no pity to myself?\n    Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd\n    Came to my tent, and every one did threat\n    To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.\n\n                            Enter RATCLIFF\n\n  RATCLIFF. My lord!\n  KING RICHARD. Zounds, who is there?\n  RATCLIFF. Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock\n    Hath twice done salutation to the morn; \n    Your friends are up and buckle on their armour.\n  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!\n    What think'st thou-will our friends prove all true?\n  RATCLIFF. No doubt, my lord.\n  KING RICHARD. O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear.\n  RATCLIFF. Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.\n  KING RICHARD By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night\n    Have stuck more terror to the soul of Richard\n    Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers\n    Armed in proof and led by shallow Richmond.\n    'Tis not yet near day. Come, go with me;\n    Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,\n    To see if any mean to shrink from me.

Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,\n    That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.\n  LORDS. How have you slept, my lord? \n  RICHMOND. The sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams\n    That ever ent'red in a drowsy head\n    Have I since your departure had, my lords.\n    Methought their souls whose bodies Richard murder'd\n    Came to my tent and cried on victory.\n    I promise you my soul is very jocund\n    In the remembrance of so fair a dream.\n    How far into the morning is it, lords?\n  LORDS. Upon the stroke of four.\n  RICHMOND. Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.\n\n                 His ORATION to his SOLDIERS\n\n    More than I have said, loving countrymen,\n    The leisure and enforcement of the time\n    Forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:\n    God and our good cause fight upon our side;\n    The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,\n    Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;\n    Richard except, those whom we fight against \n    Had rather have us win than him they follow.\n    For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,\n    A bloody tyrant and a homicide;\n    One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;\n    One that made means to come by what he hath,\n    And slaughtered those that were the means to help him;\n    A base foul stone, made precious by the foil\n    Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;\n    One that hath ever been God's enemy.\n    Then if you fight against God's enemy,\n    God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;\n    If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,\n    You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;\n    If you do fight against your country's foes,\n    Your country's foes shall pay your pains the hire;\n    If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,\n    Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;\n    If you do free your children from the sword,\n    Your children's children quits it in your age.\n    Then, in the name of God and all these rights, \n    Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.\n    For me, the ransom of my bold attempt\n    Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;\n    But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt\n    The least of you shall share his part thereof.\n    Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;\n    God and Saint George!

He smil'd, and said 'The better for our purpose.'\n  KING He was in the right; and so indeed it is.\n                                                 [Clock strikes]\n    Tell the clock there.

Then he disdains to shine; for by the book\n    He should have brav'd the east an hour ago.\n    A black day will it be to somebody.\n    Ratcliff!\n  RATCLIFF. My lord?\n  KING RICHARD. The sun will not be seen to-day;\n    The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.\n    I would these dewy tears were from the ground.\n    Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me\n    More than to Richmond? For the selfsame heaven\n    That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.\n\n                       Enter NORFOLK\n\n  NORFOLK. Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.\n  KING RICHARD. Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse;\n    Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power.\n    I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain, \n    And thus my battle shall be ordered:\n    My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,\n    Consisting equally of horse and foot;\n    Our archers shall be placed in the midst.\n    John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,\n    Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.\n    They thus directed, we will follow\n    In the main battle, whose puissance on either side\n    Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.\n    This, and Saint George to boot!

In sooth, I know not why I am so sad.\n    It wearies me; you say it wearies you;\n    But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,\n    What stuff \'tis made of, whereof it is born,\n    I am to learn;\n    And such a want-wit sadness makes of me\n    That I have much ado to know myself.\n  SALERIO. Your mind is tossing on the ocean;\n    There where your argosies, with portly sail-\n    Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,\n    Or as it were the pageants of the sea-\n    Do overpeer the petty traffickers,\n    That curtsy to them, do them reverence,\n    As they fly by them with their woven wings.\n  SOLANIO. Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,\n    The better part of my affections would\n    Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still \n    Plucking the grass to know where sits the wind,\n    Peering in maps for ports, and piers, and roads;\n    And every object that might make me fear\n    Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt,\n    Would make me sad.\n  SALERIO. My wind, cooling my broth,\n    Would blow me to an ague when I thought\n    What harm a wind too great might do at sea.\n    I should not see the sandy hour-glass run\n    But I should think of shallows and of flats,\n    And see my wealthy Andrew dock\'d in sand,\n    Vailing her high top lower than her ribs\n    To kiss her burial. Should I go to church\n    And see the holy edifice of stone,\n    And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,\n    Which, touching but my gentle vessel\'s side,\n    Would scatter all her spices on the stream,\n    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,\n    And, in a word, but even now worth this,\n    And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought \n    To think on this, and shall I lack the thought\n    That such a thing bechanc\'d would make me sad?\n    But tell not me; I know Antonio\n    Is sad to think upon his merchandise.\n  ANTONIO. Believe me, no; I thank my fortune for it,\n    My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,\n    Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate\n    Upon the fortune of this present year;\n    Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.\n  SOLANIO. Why then you are in love.\n  ANTONIO. Fie, fie!\n  SOLANIO. Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad\n    Because you are not merry; and \'twere as easy\n    For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,\n    Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,\n    Nature hath fram\'d strange fellows in her time:\n    Some that will evermore peep through their eyes,\n    And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper;\n    And other of such vinegar aspect\n    That they\'ll not show their teeth in way of smile \n    Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.\n\n               Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO\n\n    Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,\n    Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well;\n    We leave you now with better company.\n  SALERIO. I would have stay\'d till I had made you merry,\n    If worthier friends had not prevented me.\n  ANTONIO. Your worth is very dear in my regard.\n    I take it your own business calls on you,\n    And you embrace th\' occasion to depart.\n  SALERIO. Good morrow, my good lords.\n  BASSANIO. Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? Say when.\n    You grow exceeding strange; must it be so?\n  SALERIO. We\'ll make our leisures to attend on yours.\n                                      Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO\n  LORENZO. My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,\n    We two will leave you; but at dinner-time,\n    I pray you, have in mind where we must meet. \n  BASSANIO. I will not fail you.\n  GRATIANO. You look not well, Signior Antonio;\n    You have too much respect upon the world;\n    They lose it that do buy it with much care.\n    Believe me, you are marvellously chang\'d.\n  ANTONIO. I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano-\n    A stage, where every man must play a part,\n    And mine a sad one.\n  GRATIANO. Let me play the fool.\n    With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come;\n    And let my liver rather heat with wine\n    Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.\n    Why should a man whose blood is warm within\n    Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster,\n    Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice\n    By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio-\n    I love thee, and \'tis my love that speaks-\n    There are a sort of men whose visages\n    Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,\n    And do a wilful stillness entertain, \n    With purpose to be dress\'d in an opinion\n    Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;\n    As who should say \'I am Sir Oracle,\n    And when I ope my lips let no dog bark.\'\n    O my Antonio, I do know of these\n    That therefore only are reputed wise\n    For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,\n    If they should speak, would almost damn those ears\n    Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.\n    I\'ll tell thee more of this another time.\n    But fish not with this melancholy bait\n    For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.\n    Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile;\n    I\'ll end my exhortation after dinner.\n  LORENZO. Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time.\n    I must be one of these same dumb wise men,\n    For Gratiano never lets me speak.\n  GRATIANO. Well, keep me company but two years moe,\n    Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.\n  ANTONIO. Fare you well; I\'ll grow a talker for this gear. \n  GRATIANO. Thanks, i\' faith, for silence is only commendable\n    In a neat\'s tongue dried, and a maid not vendible.\n                                     Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO\n  ANTONIO. Is that anything now?\n  BASSANIO. Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more\nthan\n    any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two grains of wheat\nhid\n    in, two bushels of chaff: you shall seek all day ere you find\n    them, and when you have them they are not worth the search.\n  ANTONIO. Well; tell me now what lady is the same\n    To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,\n    That you to-day promis\'d to tell me of?\n  BASSANIO. \'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,\n    How much I have disabled mine estate\n    By something showing a more swelling port\n    Than my faint means would grant continuance;\n    Nor do I now make moan to be abridg\'d\n    From such a noble rate; but my chief care\n    Is to come fairly off from the great debts\n    Wherein my time, something too prodigal,\n    Hath left me gag\'d. To you, Antonio, \n    I owe the most, in money and in love;\n    And from your love I have a warranty\n    To unburden all my plots and purposes\n    How to get clear of all the debts I owe.\n  ANTONIO. I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;\n    And if it stand, as you yourself still do,\n    Within the eye of honour, be assur\'d\n    My purse, my person, my extremest means,\n    Lie all unlock\'d to your occasions.\n  BASSANIO. In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,\n    I shot his fellow of the self-same flight\n    The self-same way, with more advised watch,\n    To find the other forth; and by adventuring both\n    I oft found both. I urge this childhood proof,\n    Because what follows is pure innocence.\n    I owe you much; and, like a wilful youth,\n    That which I owe is lost; but if you please\n    To shoot another arrow that self way\n    Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,\n    As I will watch the aim, or to find both, \n    Or bring your latter hazard back again\n    And thankfully rest debtor for the first.\n  ANTONIO. You know me well, and herein spend but time\n    To wind about my love with circumstance;\n    And out of doubt you do me now more wrong\n    In making question of my uttermost\n    Than if you had made waste of all I have.\n    Then do but say to me what I should do\n    That in your knowledge may by me be done,\n    And I am prest unto it; therefore, speak.\n  BASSANIO. In Belmont is a lady richly left,\n    And she is fair and, fairer than that word,\n    Of wondrous virtues. Sometimes from her eyes\n    I did receive fair speechless messages.\n    Her name is Portia- nothing undervalu\'d\n    To Cato\'s daughter, Brutus\' Portia.\n    Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth;\n    For the four winds blow in from every coast\n    Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks\n    Hang on her temples like a golden fleece, \n    Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos\' strond,\n    And many Jasons come in quest of her.\n    O my Antonio, had I but the means\n    To hold a rival place with one of them,\n    I have a mind presages me such thrift\n    That I should questionless be fortunate.\n  ANTONIO. Thou know\'st that all my fortunes are at sea;\n    Neither have I money nor commodity\n    To raise a present sum; therefore go forth,\n    Try what my credit can in Venice do;\n    That shall be rack\'d, even to the uttermost,\n    To furnish thee to Belmont to fair Portia.\n    Go presently inquire, and so will I,\n    Where money is; and I no question make\n    To have it of my trust or for my sake.                Exeunt\n\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nBelmont. PORTIA\'S house\n\nEnter PORTIA with her waiting-woman, NERISSA\n\n  PORTIA. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this\n    great world.\n  NERISSA. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in\nthe\n    same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught\nI\n    see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that\n    starve with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to\nbe\n    seated in the mean: superfluity come sooner by white hairs,\nbut\n    competency lives longer.\n  PORTIA. Good sentences, and well pronounc\'d.\n  NERISSA. They would be better, if well followed.\n  PORTIA. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do,\n    chapels had been churches, and poor men\'s cottages princes\'\n    palaces. It is a good divine that follows his own\ninstructions; I\n    can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than to be\none\n    of the twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may\ndevise\n    laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps o\'er a cold\ndecree;\n    such a hare is madness the youth, to skip o\'er the meshes of\ngood \n    counsel the cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion\nto\n    choose me a husband. O me, the word \'choose\'! I may neither\n    choose who I would nor refuse who I dislike; so is the will\nof a\n    living daughter curb\'d by the will of a dead father. Is it\nnot\n    hard, Nerissa, that I cannot choose one, nor refuse none?\n  NERISSA. Your father was ever virtuous, and holy men at their\ndeath\n    have good inspirations; therefore the lott\'ry that he hath\n    devised in these three chests, of gold, silver, and lead-\nwhereof\n    who chooses his meaning chooses you- will no doubt never be\n    chosen by any rightly but one who you shall rightly love. But\n    what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these\n    princely suitors that are already come?\n  PORTIA. I pray thee over-name them; and as thou namest them, I\nwill\n    describe them; and according to my description, level at my\n    affection.\n  NERISSA. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.\n  PORTIA. Ay, that\'s a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk\nof\n    his horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own\ngood\n    parts that he can shoe him himself; I am much afear\'d my lady\nhis\n    mother play\'d false with a smith. \n  NERISSA. Then is there the County Palatine.\n  PORTIA. He doth nothing but frown, as who should say \'An you\nwill\n    not have me, choose.\' He hears merry tales and smiles not. I\nfear\n    he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old,\nbeing so\n    full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be\nmarried\n    to a death\'s-head with a bone in his mouth than to either of\n    these. God defend me from these two!\n  NERISSA. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?\n  PORTIA. God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. In\n    truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker, but he- why, he\nhath a\n    horse better than the Neapolitan\'s, a better bad habit of\n    frowning than the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man.\nIf a\n    throstle sing he falls straight a-cap\'ring; he will fence\nwith\n    his own shadow; if I should marry him, I should marry twenty\n    husbands. If he would despise me, I would forgive him; for if\nhe\n    love me to madness, I shall never requite him.\n  NERISSA. What say you then to Falconbridge, the young baron of\n    England?\n  PORTIA. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not\nme,\n    nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian, and\nyou \n    will come into the court and swear that I have a poor\npennyworth\n    in the English. He is a proper man\'s picture; but alas, who\ncan\n    converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! I think he\n    bought his doublet in Italy, his round hose in France, his\nbonnet\n    in Germany, and his behaviour everywhere.\n  NERISSA. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?\n  PORTIA. That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he\nborrowed\n    a box of the ear of the Englishman, and swore he would pay\nhim\n    again when he was able; I think the Frenchman became his\nsurety,\n    and seal\'d under for another.\n  NERISSA. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony\'s\n    nephew?\n  PORTIA. Very vilely in the morning when he is sober; and most\n    vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk. When he is best, he\nis\n    a little worse than a man, and when he is worst, he is little\n    better than a beast. An the worst fall that ever fell, I hope\nI\n    shall make shift to go without him.\n  NERISSA. If he should offer to choose, and choose the right\ncasket,\n    you should refuse to perform your father\'s will, if you\nshould\n    refuse to accept him. \n  PORTIA. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a\ndeep\n    glass of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket; for if the\ndevil be\n    within and that temptation without, I know he will choose it.\nI\n    will do anything, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.\n  NERISSA. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these\nlords;\n    they have acquainted me with their determinations, which is\n    indeed to return to their home, and to trouble you with no\nmore\n    suit, unless you may be won by some other sort than your\nfather\'s\n    imposition, depending on the caskets.\n  PORTIA. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste\nas\n    Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father\'s\nwill. I\n    am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is\nnot\n    one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God\n    grant them a fair departure.\n  NERISSA. Do you not remember, lady, in your father\'s time, a\n    Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in\ncompany of\n    the Marquis of Montferrat?\n  PORTIA. Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, so was he\ncall\'d.\n  NERISSA. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish\neyes\n    look\'d upon, was the best deserving a fair lady. \n  PORTIA. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy\n    praise.\n\n                         Enter a SERVINGMAN\n\n    How now! what news?\n  SERVINGMAN. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take\ntheir\n    leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the\nPrince of\n    Morocco, who brings word the Prince his master will be here\n    to-night.\n  PORTIA. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good heart as\nI\n    can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his\n    approach; if he have the condition of a saint and the\ncomplexion\n    of a devil, I had rather he should shrive me than wive me.\n    Come, Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.\n    Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer, another knocks at the\n      door.                                               Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nVenice. A public place\n\nEnter BASSANIO With SHYLOCK the Jew\n\n  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats- well.\n  BASSANIO. Ay, sir, for three months.\n  SHYLOCK. For three months- well.\n  BASSANIO. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.\n  SHYLOCK. Antonio shall become bound- well.\n  BASSANIO. May you stead me? Will you pleasure me? Shall I know\nyour\n    answer?\n  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats for three months, and Antonio\nbound.\n  BASSANIO. Your answer to that.\n  SHYLOCK. Antonio is a good man.\n  BASSANIO. Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?\n  SHYLOCK. Ho, no, no, no, no; my meaning in saying he is a good\nman\n    is to have you understand me that he is sufficient; yet his\nmeans\n    are in supposition: he hath an argosy bound to Tripolis,\nanother\n    to the Indies; I understand, moreover, upon the Rialto, he\nhath a\n    third at Mexico, a fourth for England- and other ventures he\n    hath, squand\'red abroad. But ships are but boards, sailors\nbut \n    men; there be land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and\n    land-thieves- I mean pirates; and then there is the peril of\n    waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,\n    sufficient. Three thousand ducats- I think I may take his\nbond.\n  BASSANIO. Be assur\'d you may.\n  SHYLOCK. I will be assur\'d I may; and, that I may be assured, I\n    will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?\n  BASSANIO. If it please you to dine with us.\n  SHYLOCK. Yes, to smell pork, to eat of the habitation which\nyour\n    prophet, the Nazarite, conjured the devil into! I will buy\nwith\n    you, sell with you, talk with you, walk with you, and so\n    following; but I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor\npray\n    with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?\n\n                            Enter ANTONIO\n\n  BASSANIO. This is Signior Antonio.\n  SHYLOCK.  [Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!\n    I hate him for he is a Christian;\n    But more for that in low simplicity \n    He lends out money gratis, and brings down\n    The rate of usance here with us in Venice.\n    If I can catch him once upon the hip,\n    I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.\n    He hates our sacred nation; and he rails,\n    Even there where merchants most do congregate,\n    On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,\n    Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe\n    If I forgive him!\n  BASSANIO. Shylock, do you hear?\n  SHYLOCK. I am debating of my present store,\n    And, by the near guess of my memory,\n    I cannot instantly raise up the gross\n    Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?\n    Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,\n    Will furnish me. But soft! how many months\n    Do you desire?  [To ANTONIO]  Rest you fair, good signior;\n    Your worship was the last man in our mouths.\n  ANTONIO. Shylock, albeit I neither lend nor borrow\n    By taking nor by giving of excess, \n    Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,\n    I\'ll break a custom.  [To BASSANIO]  Is he yet possess\'d\n    How much ye would?\n  SHYLOCK. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.\n  ANTONIO. And for three months.\n  SHYLOCK. I had forgot- three months; you told me so.\n    Well then, your bond; and, let me see- but hear you,\n    Methoughts you said you neither lend nor borrow\n    Upon advantage.\n  ANTONIO. I do never use it.\n  SHYLOCK. When Jacob graz\'d his uncle Laban\'s sheep-\n    This Jacob from our holy Abram was,\n    As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,\n    The third possessor; ay, he was the third-\n  ANTONIO. And what of him? Did he take interest?\n  SHYLOCK. No, not take interest; not, as you would say,\n    Directly int\'rest; mark what Jacob did:\n    When Laban and himself were compromis\'d\n    That all the eanlings which were streak\'d and pied\n    Should fall as Jacob\'s hire, the ewes, being rank, \n    In end of autumn turned to the rams;\n    And when the work of generation was\n    Between these woolly breeders in the act,\n    The skilful shepherd pill\'d me certain wands,\n    And, in the doing of the deed of kind,\n    He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,\n    Who, then conceiving, did in eaning time\n    Fall parti-colour\'d lambs, and those were Jacob\'s.\n    This was a way to thrive, and he was blest;\n    And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.\n  ANTONIO. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob serv\'d for;\n    A thing not in his power to bring to pass,\n    But sway\'d and fashion\'d by the hand of heaven.\n    Was this inserted to make interest good?\n    Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?\n  SHYLOCK. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast.\n    But note me, signior.\n  ANTONIO.  [Aside]  Mark you this, Bassanio,\n    The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.\n    An evil soul producing holy witness \n    Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,\n    A goodly apple rotten at the heart.\n    O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!\n  SHYLOCK. Three thousand ducats- \'tis a good round sum.\n    Three months from twelve; then let me see, the rate-\n  ANTONIO. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?\n  SHYLOCK. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft\n    In the Rialto you have rated me\n    About my moneys and my usances;\n    Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,\n    For suff\'rance is the badge of all our tribe;\n    You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,\n    And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,\n    And all for use of that which is mine own.\n    Well then, it now appears you need my help;\n    Go to, then; you come to me, and you say\n    \'Shylock, we would have moneys.\' You say so-\n    You that did void your rheum upon my beard\n    And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur\n    Over your threshold; moneys is your suit. \n    What should I say to you? Should I not say\n    \'Hath a dog money? Is it possible\n    A cur can lend three thousand ducats?\' Or\n    Shall I bend low and, in a bondman\'s key,\n    With bated breath and whisp\'ring humbleness,\n    Say this:\n    \'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last,\n    You spurn\'d me such a day; another time\n    You call\'d me dog; and for these courtesies\n    I\'ll lend you thus much moneys\'?\n  ANTONIO. I am as like to call thee so again,\n    To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.\n    If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not\n    As to thy friends- for when did friendship take\n    A breed for barren metal of his friend?-\n    But lend it rather to thine enemy,\n    Who if he break thou mayst with better face\n    Exact the penalty.\n  SHYLOCK. Why, look you, how you storm!\n    I would be friends with you, and have your love, \n    Forget the shames that you have stain\'d me with,\n    Supply your present wants, and take no doit\n    Of usance for my moneys, and you\'ll not hear me.\n    This is kind I offer.\n  BASSANIO. This were kindness.\n  SHYLOCK. This kindness will I show.\n    Go with me to a notary, seal me there\n    Your single bond, and, in a merry sport,\n    If you repay me not on such a day,\n    In such a place, such sum or sums as are\n    Express\'d in the condition, let the forfeit\n    Be nominated for an equal pound\n    Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken\n    In what part of your body pleaseth me.\n  ANTONIO. Content, in faith; I\'ll seal to such a bond,\n    And say there is much kindness in the Jew.\n  BASSANIO. You shall not seal to such a bond for me;\n    I\'ll rather dwell in my necessity.\n  ANTONIO. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it;\n    Within these two months- that\'s a month before \n    This bond expires- I do expect return\n    Of thrice three times the value of this bond.\n  SHYLOCK. O father Abram, what these Christians are,\n    Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect\n    The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this:\n    If he should break his day, what should I gain\n    By the exaction of the forfeiture?\n    A pound of man\'s flesh taken from a man\n    Is not so estimable, profitable neither,\n    As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,\n    To buy his favour, I extend this friendship;\n    If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;\n    And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.\n  ANTONIO. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.\n  SHYLOCK. Then meet me forthwith at the notary\'s;\n    Give him direction for this merry bond,\n    And I will go and purse the ducats straight,\n    See to my house, left in the fearful guard\n    Of an unthrifty knave, and presently\n    I\'ll be with you. \n  ANTONIO. Hie thee, gentle Jew.                    Exit SHYLOCK\n    The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.\n  BASSANIO. I like not fair terms and a villain\'s mind.\n  ANTONIO.

Enter the PRINCE of MOROCCO, a tawny Moor\nall in white,\nand three or four FOLLOWERS accordingly, with PORTIA, NERISSA,\nand train\n\n  PRINCE OF Morocco. Mislike me not for my complexion,\n    The shadowed livery of the burnish\'d sun,\n    To whom I am a neighbour, and near bred.\n    Bring me the fairest creature northward born,\n    Where Phoebus\' fire scarce thaws the icicles,\n    And let us make incision for your love\n    To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.\n    I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine\n    Hath fear\'d the valiant; by my love, I swear\n    The best-regarded virgins of our clime\n    Have lov\'d it too. I would not change this hue,\n    Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.\n  PORTIA. In terms of choice I am not solely led\n    By nice direction of a maiden\'s eyes;\n    Besides, the lott\'ry of my destiny \n    Bars me the right of voluntary choosing.\n    But, if my father had not scanted me,\n    And hedg\'d me by his wit to yield myself\n    His wife who wins me by that means I told you,\n    Yourself, renowned Prince, then stood as fair\n    As any comer I have look\'d on yet\n    For my affection.\n  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Even for that I thank you.\n    Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets\n    To try my fortune. By this scimitar,\n    That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince,\n    That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,\n    I would o\'erstare the sternest eyes that look,\n    Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,\n    Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,\n    Yea, mock the lion when \'a roars for prey,\n    To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!\n    If Hercules and Lichas play at dice\n    Which is the better man, the greater throw\n    May turn by fortune from the weaker band. \n    So is Alcides beaten by his page;\n    And so may I, blind Fortune leading me,\n    Miss that which one unworthier may attain,\n    And die with grieving.\n  PORTIA. You must take your chance,\n    And either not attempt to choose at all,\n    Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong,\n    Never to speak to lady afterward\n    In way of marriage; therefore be advis\'d.\n  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Nor will not; come, bring me unto my chance.\n  PORTIA. First, forward to the temple. After dinner\n    Your hazard shall be made.\n  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Good fortune then,\n    To make me blest or cursed\'st among men!\n                                           [Cornets, and exeunt]\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nVenice. A street\n\nEnter LAUNCELOT GOBBO\n\n  LAUNCELOT. Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from\nthis\n    Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and tempts me,\nsaying\n    to me \'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good Launcelot\' or \'good\nGobbo\' or\n    \'good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run\naway.\'\n    My conscience says \'No; take heed, honest Launcelot, take\nheed,\n    honest Gobbo\' or, as aforesaid, \'honest Launcelot Gobbo, do\nnot\n    run; scorn running with thy heels.\' Well, the most courageous\n    fiend bids me pack. \'Via!\' says the fiend; \'away!\' says the\n    fiend. \'For the heavens, rouse up a brave mind\' says the\nfiend\n    \'and run.\' Well, my conscience, hanging about the neck of my\n    heart, says very wisely to me \'My honest friend Launcelot,\nbeing\n    an honest man\'s son\' or rather \'an honest woman\'s son\'; for\n    indeed my father did something smack, something grow to, he\nhad a\n    kind of taste- well, my conscience says \'Launcelot, budge\nnot.\'\n    \'Budge,\' says the fiend. \'Budge not,\' says my conscience.\n    \'Conscience,\' say I, (you counsel well.\' \'Fiend,\' say I, \'you\n    counsel well.\' To be rul\'d by my conscience, I should stay\nwith \n    the Jew my master, who- God bless the mark!- is a kind of\ndevil;\n    and, to run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the\nfiend,\n    who- saving your reverence!- is the devil himself. Certainly\nthe\n    Jew is the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience, my\n    conscience is but a kind of hard conscience to offer to\ncounsel\n    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more friendly\n    counsel. I will run, fiend; my heels are at your commandment;\nI\n    will run.\n\n                     Enter OLD GOBBO, with a basket\n\n  GOBBO. Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way to\n    master Jew\'s?\n  LAUNCELOT.  [Aside]  O heavens! This is my true-begotten\nfather,\n    who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind, knows me\nnot.\n    I will try confusions with him.\n  GOBBO. Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way to\n    master Jew\'s?\n  LAUNCELOT. Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,\nat\n    the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at the very\nnext \n    turning, turn of no hand, but turn down indirectly to the\nJew\'s\n    house.\n  GOBBO. Be God\'s sonties, \'twill be a hard way to hit! Can you\ntell\n    me whether one Launcelot, that dwells with him, dwell with\nhim or\n    no?\n  LAUNCELOT. Talk you of young Master Launcelot?  [Aside]  Mark\nme\n    now; now will I raise the waters.- Talk you of young Master\n    Launcelot?\n  GOBBO. No master, sir, but a poor man\'s son; his father, though\nI\n    say\'t, is an honest exceeding poor man, and, God be thanked,\nwell\n    to live.\n  LAUNCELOT. Well, let his father be what \'a will, we talk of\nyoung\n    Master Launcelot.\n  GOBBO. Your worship\'s friend, and Launcelot, sir.\n  LAUNCELOT. But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,\ntalk\n    you of young Master Launcelot?\n  GOBBO. Of Launcelot, an\'t please your mastership.\n  LAUNCELOT. Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master\nLauncelot,\n    father; for the young gentleman, according to Fates and\nDestinies\n    and such odd sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of \n    learning, is indeed deceased; or, as you would say in plain\n    terms, gone to heaven.\n  GOBBO. Marry, God forbid! The boy was the very staff of my age,\nmy\n    very prop.\n  LAUNCELOT. Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or\na\n    prop? Do you know me, father?\n  GOBBO. Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman; but I\npray\n    you tell me, is my boy- God rest his soul!- alive or dead?\n  LAUNCELOT. Do you not know me, father?\n  GOBBO. Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.\n  LAUNCELOT. Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of\nthe\n    knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his own child.\nWell,\n    old man, I will tell you news of your son. Give me your\nblessing;\n    truth will come to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man\'s\nson\n    may, but in the end truth will out.\n  GOBBO. Pray you, sir, stand up; I am sure you are not Launcelot\nmy\n    boy.\n  LAUNCELOT. Pray you, let\'s have no more fooling about it, but\ngive\n    me your blessing; I am Launcelot, your boy that was, your son\n    that is, your child that shall be. \n  GOBBO. I cannot think you are my son.\n  LAUNCELOT. I know not what I shall think of that; but I am\n    Launcelot, the Jew\'s man, and I am sure Margery your wife is\nmy\n    mother.\n  GOBBO. Her name is Margery, indeed. I\'ll be sworn, if thou be\n    Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood. Lord worshipp\'d\n    might he be, what a beard hast thou got! Thou hast got more\nhair\n    on thy chin than Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.\n  LAUNCELOT. It should seem, then, that Dobbin\'s tail grows\nbackward;\n    I am sure he had more hair of his tail than I have of my face\n    when I last saw him.\n  GOBBO. Lord, how art thou chang\'d! How dost thou and thy master\n    agree? I have brought him a present. How \'gree you now?\n  LAUNCELOT. Well, well; but, for mine own part, as I have set up\nmy\n    rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have run some\nground.\n    My master\'s a very Jew. Give him a present! Give him a\nhalter. I\n    am famish\'d in his service; you may tell every finger I have\nwith\n    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come; give me your present\nto\n    one Master Bassanio, who indeed gives rare new liveries; if I\n    serve not him, I will run as far as God has any ground. O\nrare \n    fortune! Here comes the man. To him, father, for I am a Jew,\nif I\n    serve the Jew any longer.\n\n         Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO, with a FOLLOWER or two\n\n  BASSANIO. You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper be\n    ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See these letters\n    delivered, put the liveries to making, and desire Gratiano to\n    come anon to my lodging.                      Exit a SERVANT\n  LAUNCELOT. To him, father.\n  GOBBO. God bless your worship!\n  BASSANIO. Gramercy; wouldst thou aught with me?\n  GOBBO. Here\'s my son, sir, a poor boy-\n  LAUNCELOT. Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew\'s man, that\nwould,\n    sir, as my father shall specify-\n  GOBBO. He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to\nserve-\n  LAUNCELOT. Indeed the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,\nand\n    have a desire, as my father shall specify-\n  GOBBO. His master and he, saving your worship\'s reverence, are\n    scarce cater-cousins- \n  LAUNCELOT. To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having\ndone\n    me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being I hope an old\nman,\n    shall frutify unto you-\n  GOBBO. I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon\nyour\n    worship; and my suit is-\n  LAUNCELOT. In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as\n    your worship shall know by this honest old man; and, though I\nsay\n    it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.\n  BASSANIO. One speak for both. What would you?\n  LAUNCELOT. Serve you, sir.\n  GOBBO. That is the very defect of the matter, sir.\n  BASSANIO. I know thee well; thou hast obtain\'d thy suit.\n    Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,\n    And hath preferr\'d thee, if it be preferment\n    To leave a rich Jew\'s service to become\n    The follower of so poor a gentleman.\n  LAUNCELOT. The old proverb is very well parted between my\nmaster\n    Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of God, sir, and he\nhath\n    enough.\n  BASSANIO. Thou speak\'st it well. Go, father, with thy son. \n    Take leave of thy old master, and inquire\n    My lodging out.  [To a SERVANT]  Give him a livery\n    More guarded than his fellows\'; see it done.\n  LAUNCELOT. Father, in. I cannot get a service, no! I have ne\'er\na\n    tongue in my head!  [Looking on his palm]  Well; if any man\nin\n    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear upon a\nbook- I\n    shall have good fortune. Go to, here\'s a simple line of life;\n    here\'s a small trifle of wives; alas, fifteen wives is\nnothing;\n    a\'leven widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one\nman.\n    And then to scape drowning thrice, and to be in peril of my\nlife\n    with the edge of a feather-bed-here are simple scapes. Well,\nif\n    Fortune be a woman, she\'s a good wench for this gear. Father,\n    come; I\'ll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling.\n                                  Exeunt LAUNCELOT and OLD GOBBO\n  BASSANIO. I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this.\n    These things being bought and orderly bestowed,\n    Return in haste, for I do feast to-night\n    My best esteem\'d acquaintance; hie thee, go.\n  LEONARDO. My best endeavours shall be done herein.\n \n                          Enter GRATIANO\n\n  GRATIANO. Where\'s your master?\n  LEONARDO. Yonder, sir, he walks.                          Exit\n  GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio!\n  BASSANIO. Gratiano!\n  GRATIANO. I have suit to you.\n  BASSANIO. You have obtain\'d it.\n  GRATIANO. You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.\n  BASSANIO. Why, then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano:\n    Thou art too wild, too rude, and bold of voice-\n    Parts that become thee happily enough,\n    And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;\n    But where thou art not known, why there they show\n    Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain\n    To allay with some cold drops of modesty\n    Thy skipping spirit; lest through thy wild behaviour\n    I be misconst\'red in the place I go to\n    And lose my hopes.\n  GRATIANO. Signior Bassanio, hear me: \n    If I do not put on a sober habit,\n    Talk with respect, and swear but now and then,\n    Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,\n    Nay more, while grace is saying hood mine eyes\n    Thus with my hat, and sigh, and say amen,\n    Use all the observance of civility\n    Like one well studied in a sad ostent\n    To please his grandam, never trust me more.\n  BASSANIO. Well, we shall see your bearing.\n  GRATIANO. Nay, but I bar to-night; you shall not gauge me\n    By what we do to-night.\n  BASSANIO. No, that were pity;\n    I would entreat you rather to put on\n    Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends\n    That purpose merriment. But fare you well;\n    I have some business.\n  GRATIANO. And I must to Lorenzo and the rest;\n    But we will visit you at supper-time.                 Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nVenice. SHYLOCK\'S house\n\nEnter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT\n\n  JESSICA. I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so.\n    Our house is hell; and thou, a merry devil,\n    Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.\n    But fare thee well; there is a ducat for thee;\n    And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see\n    Lorenzo, who is thy new master\'s guest.\n    Give him this letter; do it secretly.\n    And so farewell. I would not have my father\n    See me in talk with thee.\n  LAUNCELOT. Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful\npagan,\n    most sweet Jew! If a Christian do not play the knave and get\n    thee, I am much deceived. But, adieu! these foolish drops do\n    something drown my manly spirit; adieu!\n  JESSICA. Farewell, good Launcelot.              Exit LAUNCELOT\n    Alack, what heinous sin is it in me\n    To be asham\'d to be my father\'s child!\n    But though I am a daughter to his blood, \n    I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,\n    If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,\n    Become a Christian and thy loving wife.                 Exit\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nVenice. A street\n\nEnter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALERIO, and SOLANIO\n\n  LORENZO. Nay, we will slink away in suppertime,\n    Disguise us at my lodging, and return\n    All in an hour.\n  GRATIANO. We have not made good preparation.\n  SALERIO. We have not spoke us yet of torch-bearers.\n  SOLANIO. \'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly ordered;\n    And better in my mind not undertook.\n  LORENZO. \'Tis now but four o\'clock; we have two hours\n    To furnish us.\n\n                 Enter LAUNCELOT, With a letter\n\n    Friend Launcelot, what\'s the news?\n  LAUNCELOT. An it shall please you to break up this, it shall\nseem\n    to signify.\n  LORENZO. I know the hand; in faith, \'tis a fair hand,\n    And whiter than the paper it writ on \n    Is the fair hand that writ.\n  GRATIANO. Love-news, in faith!\n  LAUNCELOT. By your leave, sir.\n  LORENZO. Whither goest thou?\n  LAUNCELOT. Marry, sir, to bid my old master, the Jew, to sup\n    to-night with my new master, the Christian.\n  LORENZO. Hold, here, take this. Tell gentle Jessica\n    I will not fail her; speak it privately.\n    Go, gentlemen,                                Exit LAUNCELOT\n    Will you prepare you for this masque to-night?\n    I am provided of a torch-bearer.\n  SALERIO. Ay, marry, I\'ll be gone about it straight.\n  SOLANIO. And so will I.\n  LORENZO. Meet me and Gratiano\n    At Gratiano\'s lodging some hour hence.\n  SALERIO. \'Tis good we do so.        Exeunt SALERIO and SOLANIO\n  GRATIANO. Was not that letter from fair Jessica?\n  LORENZO. I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed\n    How I shall take her from her father\'s house;\n    What gold and jewels she is furnish\'d with; \n    What page\'s suit she hath in readiness.\n    If e\'er the Jew her father come to heaven,\n    It will be for his gentle daughter\'s sake;\n    And never dare misfortune cross her foot,\n    Unless she do it under this excuse,\n    That she is issue to a faithless Jew.\n    Come, go with me, peruse this as thou goest;\n    Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.                Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\nVenice. Before SHYLOCK\'S house\n\nEnter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT\n\n  SHYLOCK. Well, thou shalt see; thy eyes shall be thy judge,\n    The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio.-\n    What, Jessica!- Thou shalt not gormandize\n    As thou hast done with me- What, Jessica!-\n    And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out-\n    Why, Jessica, I say!\n  LAUNCELOT. Why, Jessica!\n  SHYLOCK. Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.\n  LAUNCELOT. Your worship was wont to tell me I could do nothing\n    without bidding.\n\n                          Enter JESSICA\n\n  JESSICA. Call you? What is your will?\n  SHYLOCK. I am bid forth to supper, Jessica;\n    There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?\n    I am not bid for love; they flatter me; \n    But yet I\'ll go in hate, to feed upon\n    The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,\n    Look to my house. I am right loath to go;\n    There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,\n    For I did dream of money-bags to-night.\n  LAUNCELOT. I beseech you, sir, go; my young master doth expect\nyour\n    reproach.\n  SHYLOCK. So do I his.\n  LAUNCELOT. And they have conspired together; I will not say you\n    shall see a masque, but if you do, then it was not for\nnothing\n    that my nose fell a-bleeding on Black Monday last at six\no\'clock\n    i\' th\' morning, falling out that year on Ash Wednesday was\nfour\n    year, in th\' afternoon.\n  SHYLOCK. What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:\n    Lock up my doors, and when you hear the drum,\n    And the vile squealing of the wry-neck\'d fife,\n    Clamber not you up to the casements then,\n    Nor thrust your head into the public street\n    To gaze on Christian fools with varnish\'d faces;\n    But stop my house\'s ears- I mean my casements; \n    Let not the sound of shallow fopp\'ry enter\n    My sober house. By Jacob\'s staff, I swear\n    I have no mind of feasting forth to-night;\n    But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;\n    Say I will come.\n  LAUNCELOT. I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at window\nfor\n    all this.\n        There will come a Christian by\n        Will be worth a Jewess\' eye.                        Exit\n  SHYLOCK. What says that fool of Hagar\'s offspring, ha?\n  JESSICA. His words were \'Farewell, mistress\'; nothing else.\n  SHYLOCK. The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder,\n    Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day\n    More than the wild-cat; drones hive not with me,\n    Therefore I part with him; and part with him\n    To one that I would have him help to waste\n    His borrowed purse. Well, Jessica, go in;\n    Perhaps I will return immediately.\n    Do as I bid you, shut doors after you.\n    Fast bind, fast find- \n    A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.                  Exit\n  JESSICA. Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,\n    I have a father, you a daughter, lost.                  Exit\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VI.\nVenice. Before SHYLOCK\'S house\n\nEnter the maskers, GRATIANO and SALERIO\n\n  GRATIANO. This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo\n    Desired us to make stand.\n  SALERIO. His hour is almost past.\n  GRATIANO. And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,\n    For lovers ever run before the clock.\n  SALERIO. O, ten times faster Venus\' pigeons fly\n    To seal love\'s bonds new made than they are wont\n    To keep obliged faith unforfeited!\n  GRATIANO. That ever holds: who riseth from a feast\n    With that keen appetite that he sits down?\n    Where is the horse that doth untread again\n    His tedious measures with the unbated fire\n    That he did pace them first? All things that are\n    Are with more spirit chased than enjoyed.\n    How like a younker or a prodigal\n    The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,\n    Hugg\'d and embraced by the strumpet wind; \n    How like the prodigal doth she return,\n    With over-weather\'d ribs and ragged sails,\n    Lean, rent, and beggar\'d by the strumpet wind!\n\n                       Enter LORENZO\n\n  SALERIO. Here comes Lorenzo; more of this hereafter.\n  LORENZO. Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode!\n    Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait.\n    When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,\n    I\'ll watch as long for you then. Approach;\n    Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who\'s within?\n\n           Enter JESSICA, above, in boy\'s clothes\n\n  JESSICA. Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,\n    Albeit I\'ll swear that I do know your tongue.\n  LORENZO. Lorenzo, and thy love.\n  JESSICA. Lorenzo, certain; and my love indeed;\n    For who love I so much? And now who knows \n    But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?\n  LORENZO. Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.\n  JESSICA. Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.\n    I am glad \'tis night, you do not look on me,\n    For I am much asham\'d of my exchange;\n    But love is blind, and lovers cannot see\n    The pretty follies that themselves commit,\n    For, if they could, Cupid himself would blush\n    To see me thus transformed to a boy.\n  LORENZO. Descend, for you must be my torch-bearer.\n  JESSICA. What! must I hold a candle to my shames?\n    They in themselves, good sooth, are too too light.\n    Why, \'tis an office of discovery, love,\n    And I should be obscur\'d.\n  LORENZO. So are you, sweet,\n    Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.\n    But come at once,\n    For the close night doth play the runaway,\n    And we are stay\'d for at Bassanio\'s feast.\n  JESSICA. I will make fast the doors, and gild myself \n    With some moe ducats, and be with you straight.\n                                                      Exit above\n\n  GRATIANO. Now, by my hood, a gentle, and no Jew.\n  LORENZO. Beshrew me, but I love her heartily,\n    For she is wise, if I can judge of her,\n    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,\n    And true she is, as she hath prov\'d herself;\n    And therefore, like herself, wise, fair, and true,\n    Shall she be placed in my constant soul.\n\n                     Enter JESSICA, below\n\n    What, art thou come? On, gentlemen, away;\n    Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.\n                                   Exit with JESSICA and SALERIO\n\n                        Enter ANTONIO\n\n  ANTONIO. Who\'s there? \n  GRATIANO. Signior Antonio?\n  ANTONIO. Fie, fie, Gratiano, where are all the rest?\n    \'Tis nine o\'clock; our friends all stay for you;\n    No masque to-night; the wind is come about;\n    Bassanio presently will go aboard;\n    I have sent twenty out to seek for you.\n  GRATIANO. I am glad on\'t; I desire no more delight\n    Than to be under sail and gone to-night.              Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VII.\nBelmont. PORTIA\'s house\n\nFlourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO,\nand their trains\n\n  PORTIA. Go draw aside the curtains and discover\n    The several caskets to this noble Prince.\n    Now make your choice.\n  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. The first, of gold, who this inscription\nbears:\n    \'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.\'\n    The second, silver, which this promise carries:\n    \'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\'\n    This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt:\n    \'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\'\n    How shall I know if I do choose the right?\n  PORTIA. The one of them contains my picture, Prince;\n    If you choose that, then I am yours withal.\n  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;\n    I will survey th\' inscriptions back again.\n    What says this leaden casket?\n    \'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\' \n    Must give- for what? For lead? Hazard for lead!\n    This casket threatens; men that hazard all\n    Do it in hope of fair advantages.\n    A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;\n    I\'ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.\n    What says the silver with her virgin hue?\n    \'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\'\n    As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,\n    And weigh thy value with an even hand.\n    If thou beest rated by thy estimation,\n    Thou dost deserve enough, and yet enough\n    May not extend so far as to the lady;\n    And yet to be afeard of my deserving\n    Were but a weak disabling of myself.\n    As much as I deserve? Why, that\'s the lady!\n    I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,\n    In graces, and in qualities of breeding;\n    But more than these, in love I do deserve.\n    What if I stray\'d no farther, but chose here?\n    Let\'s see once more this saying grav\'d in gold: \n    \'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.\'\n    Why, that\'s the lady! All the world desires her;\n    From the four corners of the earth they come\n    To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint.\n    The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds\n    Of wide Arabia are as throughfares now\n    For princes to come view fair Portia.\n    The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head\n    Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar\n    To stop the foreign spirits, but they come\n    As o\'er a brook to see fair Portia.\n    One of these three contains her heavenly picture.\n    Is\'t like that lead contains her? \'Twere damnation\n    To think so base a thought; it were too gross\n    To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.\n    Or shall I think in silver she\'s immur\'d,\n    Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?\n    O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem\n    Was set in worse than gold. They have in England\n    A coin that bears the figure of an angel \n    Stamp\'d in gold; but that\'s insculp\'d upon.\n    But here an angel in a golden bed\n    Lies all within. Deliver me the key;\n    Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!\n  PORTIA. There, take it, Prince, and if my form lie there,\n    Then I am yours.                [He opens the golden casket]\n  PRINCE OF MOROCCO. O hell! what have we here?\n    A carrion Death, within whose empty eye\n    There is a written scroll! I\'ll read the writing.\n         \'All that glisters is not gold,\n         Often have you heard that told;\n         Many a man his life hath sold\n         But my outside to behold.\n         Gilded tombs do worms infold.\n         Had you been as wise as bold,\n         Young in limbs, in judgment old,\n         Your answer had not been inscroll\'d.\n         Fare you well, your suit is cold.\'\n      Cold indeed, and labour lost,\n      Then farewell, heat, and welcome, frost. \n    Portia, adieu! I have too griev\'d a heart\n    To take a tedious leave; thus losers part.\n                        Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets\n  PORTIA. A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.\n    Let all of his complexion choose me so.               Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE VIII.\nVenice. A street\n\nEnter SALERIO and SOLANIO\n\n  SALERIO. Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail;\n    With him is Gratiano gone along;\n    And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.\n  SOLANIO. The villain Jew with outcries rais\'d the Duke,\n    Who went with him to search Bassanio\'s ship.\n  SALERIO. He came too late, the ship was under sail;\n    But there the Duke was given to understand\n    That in a gondola were seen together\n    Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica;\n    Besides, Antonio certified the Duke\n    They were not with Bassanio in his ship.\n  SOLANIO. I never heard a passion so confus\'d,\n    So strange, outrageous, and so variable,\n    As the dog Jew did utter in the streets.\n    \'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!\n    Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!\n    Justice! the law! My ducats and my daughter! \n    A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,\n    Of double ducats, stol\'n from me by my daughter!\n    And jewels- two stones, two rich and precious stones,\n    Stol\'n by my daughter! Justice! Find the girl;\n    She hath the stones upon her and the ducats.\'\n  SALERIO. Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,\n    Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.\n  SOLANIO. Let good Antonio look he keep his day,\n    Or he shall pay for this.\n  SALERIO. Marry, well rememb\'red;\n    I reason\'d with a Frenchman yesterday,\n    Who told me, in the narrow seas that part\n    The French and English, there miscarried\n    A vessel of our country richly fraught.\n    I thought upon Antonio when he told me,\n    And wish\'d in silence that it were not his.\n  SOLANIO. You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;\n    Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.\n  SALERIO. A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.\n    I saw Bassanio and Antonio part. \n    Bassanio told him he would make some speed\n    Of his return. He answered \'Do not so;\n    Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio,\n    But stay the very riping of the time;\n    And for the Jew\'s bond which he hath of me,\n    Let it not enter in your mind of love;\n    Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts\n    To courtship, and such fair ostents of love\n    As shall conveniently become you there.\'\n    And even there, his eye being big with tears,\n    Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,\n    And with affection wondrous sensible\n    He wrung Bassanio\'s hand; and so they parted.\n  SOLANIO. I think he only loves the world for him.\n    I pray thee, let us go and find him out,\n    And quicken his embraced heaviness\n    With some delight or other.\n  SALERIO. Do we so.                                      Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IX.\nBelmont. PORTIA\'S house\n\nEnter NERISSA, and a SERVITOR\n\n  NERISSA. Quick, quick, I pray thee, draw the curtain straight;\n    The Prince of Arragon hath ta\'en his oath,\n    And comes to his election presently.\n\n       Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,\n                    PORTIA, and their trains\n\n  PORTIA. Behold, there stand the caskets, noble Prince.\n    If you choose that wherein I am contain\'d,\n    Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemniz\'d;\n    But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,\n    You must be gone from hence immediately.\n  ARRAGON. I am enjoin\'d by oath to observe three things:\n    First, never to unfold to any one\n    Which casket \'twas I chose; next, if I fail\n    Of the right casket, never in my life\n    To woo a maid in way of marriage; \n    Lastly,\n    If I do fail in fortune of my choice,\n    Immediately to leave you and be gone.\n  PORTIA. To these injunctions every one doth swear\n    That comes to hazard for my worthless self.\n  ARRAGON. And so have I address\'d me. Fortune now\n    To my heart\'s hope! Gold, silver, and base lead.\n    \'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.\'\n    You shall look fairer ere I give or hazard.\n    What says the golden chest? Ha! let me see:\n    \'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.\'\n    What many men desire- that \'many\' may be meant\n    By the fool multitude, that choose by show,\n    Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;\n    Which pries not to th\' interior, but, like the martlet,\n    Builds in the weather on the outward wall,\n    Even in the force and road of casualty.\n    I will not choose what many men desire,\n    Because I will not jump with common spirits\n    And rank me with the barbarous multitudes. \n    Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house!\n    Tell me once more what title thou dost bear.\n    \'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\'\n    And well said too; for who shall go about\n    To cozen fortune, and be honourable\n    Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume\n    To wear an undeserved dignity.\n    O that estates, degrees, and offices,\n    Were not deriv\'d corruptly, and that clear honour\n    Were purchas\'d by the merit of the wearer!\n    How many then should cover that stand bare!\n    How many be commanded that command!\n    How much low peasantry would then be gleaned\n    From the true seed of honour! and how much honour\n    Pick\'d from the chaff and ruin of the times,\n    To be new varnish\'d! Well, but to my choice.\n    \'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.\'\n    I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,\n    And instantly unlock my fortunes here.\n                                    [He opens the silver casket] \n  PORTIA.  [Aside]  Too long a pause for that which you find\nthere.\n  ARRAGON. What\'s here? The portrait of a blinking idiot\n    Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.\n    How much unlike art thou to Portia!\n    How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!\n    \'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.\'\n    Did I deserve no more than a fool\'s head?\n    Is that my prize? Are my deserts no better?\n  PORTIA. To offend and judge are distinct offices\n    And of opposed natures.\n  ARRAGON. What is here?  [Reads]\n\n         \'The fire seven times tried this;\n         Seven times tried that judgment is\n         That did never choose amiss.\n         Some there be that shadows kiss,\n         Such have but a shadow\'s bliss.\n         There be fools alive iwis\n         Silver\'d o\'er, and so was this.\n         Take what wife you will to bed, \n         I will ever be your head.\n         So be gone; you are sped.\'\n\n         Still more fool I shall appear\n         By the time I linger here.\n         With one fool\'s head I came to woo,\n         But I go away with two.\n         Sweet, adieu!

When they do choose,\n    They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.\n  NERISSA. The ancient saying is no heresy:\n    Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.\n  PORTIA. Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.\n\n                       Enter a SERVANT\n\n  SERVANT. Where is my lady? \n  PORTIA. Here; what would my lord?\n  SERVANT.

Yet I have not seen\n    So likely an ambassador of love.\n    A day in April never came so sweet\n    To show how costly summer was at hand\n    As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.\n  PORTIA. No more, I pray thee; I am half afeard\n    Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,\n    Thou spend\'st such high-day wit in praising him.\n    Come, come, Nerissa, for I long to see\n    Quick Cupid\'s post that comes so mannerly.\n  NERISSA.

Now, what news on the Rialto?\n  SALERIO. Why, yet it lives there uncheck\'d that Antonio hath a\nship\n    of rich lading wreck\'d on the narrow seas; the Goodwins I\nthink\n    they call the place, a very dangerous flat and fatal, where\nthe\n    carcases of many a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my\n    gossip Report be an honest woman of her word.\n  SOLANIO. I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever\nknapp\'d\n    ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death\nof a\n    third husband. But it is true, without any slips of prolixity\nor\n    crossing the plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio,\nthe\n    honest Antonio- O that I had a title good enough to keep his\nname\n    company!-\n  SALERIO. Come, the full stop.\n  SOLANIO. Ha! What sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath lost a\n    ship.\n  SALERIO. I would it might prove the end of his losses.\n  SOLANIO. Let me say amen betimes, lest the devil cross my\nprayer, \n    for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.\n\n                             Enter SHYLOCK\n\n    How now, Shylock? What news among the merchants?\n  SHYLOCK. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my\n    daughter\'s flight.\n  SALERIO. That\'s certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that\nmade\n    the wings she flew withal.\n  SOLANIO. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was\nflidge;\n    and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam.\n  SHYLOCK. She is damn\'d for it.\n  SALERIO. That\'s certain, if the devil may be her judge.\n  SHYLOCK. My own flesh and blood to rebel!\n  SOLANIO. Out upon it, old carrion! Rebels it at these years?\n  SHYLOCK. I say my daughter is my flesh and my blood.\n  SALERIO. There is more difference between thy flesh and hers\nthan\n    between jet and ivory; more between your bloods than there is\n    between red wine and Rhenish. But tell us, do you hear\nwhether\n    Antonio have had any loss at sea or no? \n  SHYLOCK. There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a\nprodigal,\n    who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a beggar, that\nwas\n    us\'d to come so smug upon the mart. Let him look to his bond.\nHe\n    was wont to call me usurer; let him look to his bond. He was\nwont\n    to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him look to his\nbond.\n  SALERIO. Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take his\n    flesh. What\'s that good for?\n  SHYLOCK. To bait fish withal. If it will feed nothing else, it\nwill\n    feed my revenge. He hath disgrac\'d me and hind\'red me half a\n    million; laugh\'d at my losses, mock\'d at my gains, scorned my\n    nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine\n    enemies. And what\'s his reason? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew\neyes?\n    Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections,\n    passions, fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons,\n    subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means,\nwarmed\n    and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?\nIf\n    you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not\nlaugh?\n    If you poison us, do we not die? And if you wrong us, shall\nwe\n    not revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will resemble\nyou\n    in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility? \n    Revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his\nsufferance\n    be by Christian example? Why, revenge. The villainy you teach\nme\n    I will execute; and itshall go hard but I will better the\n    instruction.\n\n                    Enter a MAN from ANTONIO\n\n  MAN. Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house, and desires\nto\n    speak with you both.\n  SALERIO. We have been up and down to seek him.\n\n                          Enter TUBAL\n\n  SOLANIO. Here comes another of the tribe; a third cannot be\n    match\'d, unless the devil himself turn Jew.\n                                Exeunt SOLANIO, SALERIO, and MAN\n  SHYLOCK. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa? Hast thou found\nmy\n    daughter?\n  TUBAL. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find\nher.\n  SHYLOCK. Why there, there, there, there! A diamond gone, cost\nme \n    two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse never fell upon\nour\n    nation till now; I never felt it till now. Two thousand\nducats in\n    that, and other precious, precious jewels. I would my\ndaughter\n    were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear; would she\nwere\n    hears\'d at my foot, and the ducats in her coffin! No news of\n    them? Why, so- and I know not what\'s spent in the search.\nWhy,\n    thou- loss upon loss! The thief gone with so much, and so\nmuch to\n    find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill\nluck\n    stirring but what lights o\' my shoulders; no sighs but o\' my\n    breathing; no tears but o\' my shedding!\n  TUBAL. Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I heard in\n    Genoa-\n  SHYLOCK. What, what, what? Ill luck, ill luck?\n  TUBAL. Hath an argosy cast away coming from Tripolis.\n  SHYLOCK. I thank God, I thank God. Is it true, is it true?\n  TUBAL. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.\n  SHYLOCK. I thank thee, good Tubal. Good news, good news- ha,\nha!-\n    heard in Genoa.\n  TUBAL. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night,\n    fourscore ducats. \n  SHYLOCK. Thou stick\'st a dagger in me- I shall never see my\ngold\n    again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! Fourscore ducats!\n  TUBAL. There came divers of Antonio\'s creditors in my company\nto\n    Venice that swear he cannot choose but break.\n  SHYLOCK. I am very glad of it; I\'ll plague him, I\'ll torture\nhim; I\n    am glad of it.\n  TUBAL. One of them showed me a ring that he had of your\ndaughter\n    for a monkey.\n  SHYLOCK. Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal. It was my\n    turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor; I would\nnot\n    have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.\n  TUBAL. But Antonio is certainly undone.\n  SHYLOCK. Nay, that\'s true; that\'s very true. Go, Tubal, fee me\nan\n    officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I will have the\nheart of\n    him, if he forfeit; for, were he out of Venice, I can make\nwhat\n    merchandise I will. Go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;\ngo,\n    good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.                  Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nBelmont. PORTIA\'S house\n\nEnter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and all their trains\n\n  PORTIA. I pray you tarry; pause a day or two\n    Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,\n    I lose your company; therefore forbear a while.\n    There\'s something tells me- but it is not love-\n    I would not lose you; and you know yourself\n    Hate counsels not in such a quality.\n    But lest you should not understand me well-\n    And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought-\n    I would detain you here some month or two\n    Before you venture for me. I could teach you\n    How to choose right, but then I am forsworn;\n    So will I never be; so may you miss me;\n    But if you do, you\'ll make me wish a sin,\n    That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes!\n    They have o\'erlook\'d me and divided me;\n    One half of me is yours, the other half yours- \n    Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,\n    And so all yours. O! these naughty times\n    Puts bars between the owners and their rights;\n    And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,\n    Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.\n    I speak too long, but \'tis to peize the time,\n    To eke it, and to draw it out in length,\n    To stay you from election.\n  BASSANIO. Let me choose;\n    For as I am, I live upon the rack.\n  PORTIA. Upon the rack, Bassanio? Then confess\n    What treason there is mingled with your love.\n  BASSANIO. None but that ugly treason of mistrust\n    Which makes me fear th\' enjoying of my love;\n    There may as well be amity and life\n    \'Tween snow and fire as treason and my love.\n  PORTIA. Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,\n    Where men enforced do speak anything.\n  BASSANIO. Promise me life, and I\'ll confess the truth.\n  PORTIA. Well then, confess and live. \n  BASSANIO. \'Confess\' and \'love\'\n    Had been the very sum of my confession.\n    O happy torment, when my torturer\n    Doth teach me answers for deliverance!\n    But let me to my fortune and the caskets.\n  PORTIA. Away, then; I am lock\'d in one of them.\n    If you do love me, you will find me out.\n    Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof;\n    Let music sound while he doth make his choice;\n    Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,\n    Fading in music. That the comparison\n    May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream\n    And wat\'ry death-bed for him. He may win;\n    And what is music then? Then music is\n    Even as the flourish when true subjects bow\n    To a new-crowned monarch; such it is\n    As are those dulcet sounds in break of day\n    That creep into the dreaming bridegroom\'s ear\n    And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,\n    With no less presence, but with much more love, \n    Than young Alcides when he did redeem\n    The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy\n    To the sea-monster. I stand for sacrifice;\n    The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,\n    With bleared visages come forth to view\n    The issue of th\' exploit. Go, Hercules!\n    Live thou, I live. With much much more dismay\n    I view the fight than thou that mak\'st the fray.\n\n                            A SONG\n\n      the whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself\n\n                 Tell me where is fancy bred,\n                 Or in the heart or in the head,\n                 How begot, how nourished?\n                   Reply, reply.\n                 It is engend\'red in the eyes,\n                 With gazing fed; and fancy dies\n                 In the cradle where it lies. \n                   Let us all ring fancy\'s knell:\n                   I\'ll begin it- Ding, dong, bell.\n  ALL.           Ding, dong, bell.\n\n  BASSANIO. So may the outward shows be least themselves;\n    The world is still deceiv\'d with ornament.\n    In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt\n    But, being season\'d with a gracious voice,\n    Obscures the show of evil? In religion,\n    What damned error but some sober brow\n    Will bless it, and approve it with a text,\n    Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?\n    There is no vice so simple but assumes\n    Some mark of virtue on his outward parts.\n    How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false\n    As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins\n    The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;\n    Who, inward search\'d, have livers white as milk!\n    And these assume but valour\'s excrement\n    To render them redoubted. Look on beauty \n    And you shall see \'tis purchas\'d by the weight,\n    Which therein works a miracle in nature,\n    Making them lightest that wear most of it;\n    So are those crisped snaky golden locks\n    Which make such wanton gambols with the wind\n    Upon supposed fairness often known\n    To be the dowry of a second head-\n    The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.\n    Thus ornament is but the guiled shore\n    To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf\n    Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,\n    The seeming truth which cunning times put on\n    To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,\n    Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;\n    Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge\n    \'Tween man and man; but thou, thou meagre lead,\n    Which rather threaten\'st than dost promise aught,\n    Thy plainness moves me more than eloquence,\n    And here choose I. Joy be the consequence!\n  PORTIA.  [Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air, \n    As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embrac\'d despair,\n    And shudd\'ring fear, and green-ey\'d jealousy!\n    O love, be moderate, allay thy ecstasy,\n    In measure rain thy joy, scant this excess!\n    I feel too much thy blessing. Make it less,\n    For fear I surfeit.\n  BASSANIO.  [Opening the leaden casket]  What find I here?\n    Fair Portia\'s counterfeit! What demi-god\n    Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?\n    Or whether riding on the balls of mine\n    Seem they in motion? Here are sever\'d lips,\n    Parted with sugar breath; so sweet a bar\n    Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs\n    The painter plays the spider, and hath woven\n    A golden mesh t\' entrap the hearts of men\n    Faster than gnats in cobwebs. But her eyes-\n    How could he see to do them? Having made one,\n    Methinks it should have power to steal both his,\n    And leave itself unfurnish\'d. Yet look how far\n    The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow \n    In underprizing it, so far this shadow\n    Doth limp behind the substance. Here\'s the scroll,\n    The continent and summary of my fortune.\n         \'You that choose not by the view,\n         Chance as fair and choose as true!\n         Since this fortune falls to you,\n         Be content and seek no new.\n         If you be well pleas\'d with this,\n         And hold your fortune for your bliss,\n         Turn to where your lady is\n         And claim her with a loving kiss.\'\n    A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;\n    I come by note, to give and to receive.\n    Like one of two contending in a prize,\n    That thinks he hath done well in people\'s eyes,\n    Hearing applause and universal shout,\n    Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt\n    Whether those peals of praise be his or no;\n    So, thrice-fair lady, stand I even so,\n    As doubtful whether what I see be true, \n    Until confirm\'d, sign\'d, ratified by you.\n  PORTIA. You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,\n    Such as I am. Though for myself alone\n    I would not be ambitious in my wish\n    To wish myself much better, yet for you\n    I would be trebled twenty times myself,\n    A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich,\n    That only to stand high in your account\n    I might in virtues, beauties, livings, friends,\n    Exceed account. But the full sum of me\n    Is sum of something which, to term in gross,\n    Is an unlesson\'d girl, unschool\'d, unpractis\'d;\n    Happy in this, she is not yet so old\n    But she may learn; happier than this,\n    She is not bred so dull but she can learn;\n    Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit\n    Commits itself to yours to be directed,\n    As from her lord, her governor, her king.\n    Myself and what is mine to you and yours\n    Is now converted. But now I was the lord \n    Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,\n    Queen o\'er myself; and even now, but now,\n    This house, these servants, and this same myself,\n    Are yours- my lord\'s. I give them with this ring,\n    Which when you part from, lose, or give away,\n    Let it presage the ruin of your love,\n    And be my vantage to exclaim on you.\n  BASSANIO. Madam, you have bereft me of all words;\n    Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;\n    And there is such confusion in my powers\n    As, after some oration fairly spoke\n    By a beloved prince, there doth appear\n    Among the buzzing pleased multitude,\n    Where every something, being blent together,\n    Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy\n    Express\'d and not express\'d. But when this ring\n    Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence;\n    O, then be bold to say Bassanio\'s dead!\n  NERISSA. My lord and lady, it is now our time\n    That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper \n    To cry \'Good joy.\' Good joy, my lord and lady!\n  GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio, and my gentle lady,\n    I wish you all the joy that you can wish,\n    For I am sure you can wish none from me;\n    And, when your honours mean to solemnize\n    The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you\n    Even at that time I may be married too.\n  BASSANIO. With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.\n  GRATIANO. I thank your lordship, you have got me one.\n    My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:\n    You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;\n    You lov\'d, I lov\'d; for intermission\n    No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.\n    Your fortune stood upon the caskets there,\n    And so did mine too, as the matter falls;\n    For wooing here until I sweat again,\n    And swearing till my very roof was dry\n    With oaths of love, at last- if promise last-\n    I got a promise of this fair one here\n    To have her love, provided that your fortune \n    Achiev\'d her mistress.\n  PORTIA. Is this true, Nerissa?\n  NERISSA. Madam, it is, so you stand pleas\'d withal.\n  BASSANIO. And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?\n  GRATIANO. Yes, faith, my lord.\n  BASSANIO. Our feast shall be much honoured in your marriage.\n  GRATIANO. We\'ll play with them: the first boy for a thousand\n    ducats.\n  NERISSA. What, and stake down?\n  GRATIANO. No; we shall ne\'er win at that sport, and stake down-\n    But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel?\n    What, and my old Venetian friend, Salerio!\n\n          Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a messenger\n                           from Venice\n\n  BASSANIO. Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither,\n    If that the youth of my new int\'rest here\n    Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,\n    I bid my very friends and countrymen, \n    Sweet Portia, welcome.\n  PORTIA. So do I, my lord;\n    They are entirely welcome.\n  LORENZO. I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,\n    My purpose was not to have seen you here;\n    But meeting with Salerio by the way,\n    He did entreat me, past all saying nay,\n    To come with him along.\n  SALERIO. I did, my lord,\n    And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio\n    Commends him to you.               [Gives BASSANIO a letter]\n  BASSANIO. Ere I ope his letter,\n    I pray you tell me how my good friend doth.\n  SALERIO. Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;\n    Nor well, unless in mind; his letter there\n    Will show you his estate.        [BASSANIO opens the letter]\n  GRATIANO. Nerissa, cheer yond stranger; bid her welcome.\n    Your hand, Salerio. What\'s the news from Venice?\n    How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?\n    I know he will be glad of our success: \n    We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.\n  SALERIO. I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.\n  PORTIA. There are some shrewd contents in yond same paper\n    That steals the colour from Bassanio\'s cheek:\n    Some dear friend dead, else nothing in the world\n    Could turn so much the constitution\n    Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!\n    With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,\n    And I must freely have the half of anything\n    That this same paper brings you.\n  BASSANIO. O sweet Portia,\n    Here are a few of the unpleasant\'st words\n    That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,\n    When I did first impart my love to you,\n    I freely told you all the wealth I had\n    Ran in my veins- I was a gentleman;\n    And then I told you true. And yet, dear lady,\n    Rating myself at nothing, you shall see\n    How much I was a braggart. When I told you\n    My state was nothing, I should then have told you \n    That I was worse than nothing; for indeed\n    I have engag\'d myself to a dear friend,\n    Engag\'d my friend to his mere enemy,\n    To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady,\n    The paper as the body of my friend,\n    And every word in it a gaping wound\n    Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?\n    Hath all his ventures fail\'d? What, not one hit?\n    From Tripolis, from Mexico, and England,\n    From Lisbon, Barbary, and India,\n    And not one vessel scape the dreadful touch\n    Of merchant-marring rocks?\n  SALERIO. Not one, my lord.\n    Besides, it should appear that, if he had\n    The present money to discharge the Jew,\n    He would not take it. Never did I know\n    A creature that did bear the shape of man\n    So keen and greedy to confound a man.\n    He plies the Duke at morning and at night,\n    And doth impeach the freedom of the state, \n    If they deny him justice. Twenty merchants,\n    The Duke himself, and the magnificoes\n    Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;\n    But none can drive him from the envious plea\n    Of forfeiture, of justice, and his bond.\n  JESSICA. When I was with him, I have heard him swear\n    To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,\n    That he would rather have Antonio\'s flesh\n    Than twenty times the value of the sum\n    That he did owe him; and I know, my lord,\n    If law, authority, and power, deny not,\n    It will go hard with poor Antonio.\n  PORTIA. Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?\n  BASSANIO. The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,\n    The best condition\'d and unwearied spirit\n    In doing courtesies; and one in whom\n    The ancient Roman honour more appears\n    Than any that draws breath in Italy.\n  PORTIA. What sum owes he the Jew?\n  BASSANIO. For me, three thousand ducats. \n  PORTIA. What! no more?\n    Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;\n    Double six thousand, and then treble that,\n    Before a friend of this description\n    Shall lose a hair through Bassanio\'s fault.\n    First go with me to church and call me wife,\n    And then away to Venice to your friend;\n    For never shall you lie by Portia\'s side\n    With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold\n    To pay the petty debt twenty times over.\n    When it is paid, bring your true friend along.\n    My maid Nerissa and myself meantime\n    Will live as maids and widows. Come, away;\n    For you shall hence upon your wedding day.\n    Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer;\n    Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.\n    But let me hear the letter of your friend.\n  BASSANIO.  [Reads]  \'Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all\nmiscarried,\n    my creditors grow cruel, my estate is very low, my bond to\nthe\n    Jew is forfeit; and since, in paying it, it is impossible I \n    should live, all debts are clear\'d between you and I, if I\nmight\n    but see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your pleasure;\nif\n    your love do not persuade you to come, let not my letter.\'\n  PORTIA. O love, dispatch all business and be gone!\n  BASSANIO. Since I have your good leave to go away,\n    I will make haste; but, till I come again,\n    No bed shall e\'er be guilty of my stay,\n    Nor rest be interposer \'twixt us twain.               Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nVenice. A street\n\nEnter SHYLOCK, SOLANIO, ANTONIO, and GAOLER\n\n  SHYLOCK. Gaoler, look to him. Tell not me of mercy-\n    This is the fool that lent out money gratis.\n    Gaoler, look to him.\n  ANTONIO. Hear me yet, good Shylock.\n  SHYLOCK. I\'ll have my bond; speak not against my bond.\n    I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.\n    Thou call\'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause,\n    But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs;\n    The Duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,\n    Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond\n    To come abroad with him at his request.\n  ANTONIO. I pray thee hear me speak.\n  SHYLOCK. I\'ll have my bond. I will not hear thee speak;\n    I\'ll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.\n    I\'ll not be made a soft and dull-ey\'d fool,\n    To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield,\n    To Christian intercessors. Follow not; \n    I\'ll have no speaking; I will have my bond.             Exit\n  SOLANIO. It is the most impenetrable cur\n    That ever kept with men.\n  ANTONIO. Let him alone;\n    I\'ll follow him no more with bootless prayers.\n    He seeks my life; his reason well I know:\n    I oft deliver\'d from his forfeitures\n    Many that have at times made moan to me;\n    Therefore he hates me.\n  SOLANIO. I am sure the Duke\n    Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.\n  ANTONIO. The Duke cannot deny the course of law;\n    For the commodity that strangers have\n    With us in Venice, if it be denied,\n    Will much impeach the justice of the state,\n    Since that the trade and profit of the city\n    Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go;\n    These griefs and losses have so bated me\n    That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh\n    To-morrow to my bloody creditor. \n    Well, gaoler, on; pray God Bassanio come\n    To see me pay his debt, and then I care not.          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nBelmont. PORTIA\'S house\n\nEnter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR\n\n  LORENZO. Madam, although I speak it in your presence,\n    You have a noble and a true conceit\n    Of godlike amity, which appears most strongly\n    In bearing thus the absence of your lord.\n    But if you knew to whom you show this honour,\n    How true a gentleman you send relief,\n    How dear a lover of my lord your husband,\n    I know you would be prouder of the work\n    Than customary bounty can enforce you.\n  PORTIA. I never did repent for doing good,\n    Nor shall not now; for in companions\n    That do converse and waste the time together,\n    Whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love,\n    There must be needs a like proportion\n    Of lineaments, of manners, and of spirit,\n    Which makes me think that this Antonio,\n    Being the bosom lover of my lord, \n    Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,\n    How little is the cost I have bestowed\n    In purchasing the semblance of my soul\n    From out the state of hellish cruelty!\n    This comes too near the praising of myself;\n    Therefore, no more of it; hear other things.\n    Lorenzo, I commit into your hands\n    The husbandry and manage of my house\n    Until my lord\'s return; for mine own part,\n    I have toward heaven breath\'d a secret vow\n    To live in prayer and contemplation,\n    Only attended by Nerissa here,\n    Until her husband and my lord\'s return.\n    There is a monastery two miles off,\n    And there we will abide. I do desire you\n    Not to deny this imposition,\n    The which my love and some necessity\n    Now lays upon you.\n  LORENZO. Madam, with all my heart\n    I shall obey you in an fair commands. \n  PORTIA. My people do already know my mind,\n    And will acknowledge you and Jessica\n    In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.\n    So fare you well till we shall meet again.\n  LORENZO. Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!\n  JESSICA. I wish your ladyship all heart\'s content.\n  PORTIA. I thank you for your wish, and am well pleas\'d\n    To wish it back on you. Fare you well, Jessica.\n                                      Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO\n    Now, Balthasar,\n    As I have ever found thee honest-true,\n    So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,\n    And use thou all th\' endeavour of a man\n    In speed to Padua; see thou render this\n    Into my cousin\'s hands, Doctor Bellario;\n    And look what notes and garments he doth give thee,\n    Bring them, I pray thee, with imagin\'d speed\n    Unto the traject, to the common ferry\n    Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,\n    But get thee gone; I shall be there before thee. \n  BALTHASAR. Madam, I go with all convenient speed.         Exit\n  PORTIA. Come on, Nerissa, I have work in hand\n    That you yet know not of; we\'ll see our husbands\n    Before they think of us.\n  NERISSA. Shall they see us?\n  PORTIA. They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit\n    That they shall think we are accomplished\n    With that we lack. I\'ll hold thee any wager,\n    When we are both accoutred like young men,\n    I\'ll prove the prettier fellow of the two,\n    And wear my dagger with the braver grace,\n    And speak between the change of man and boy\n    With a reed voice; and turn two mincing steps\n    Into a manly stride; and speak of frays\n    Like a fine bragging youth; and tell quaint lies,\n    How honourable ladies sought my love,\n    Which I denying, they fell sick and died-\n    I could not do withal. Then I\'ll repent,\n    And wish for all that, that I had not kill\'d them.\n    And twenty of these puny lies I\'ll tell, \n    That men shall swear I have discontinued school\n    About a twelvemonth. I have within my mind\n    A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,\n    Which I will practise.\n  NERISSA. Why, shall we turn to men?\n  PORTIA. Fie, what a question\'s that,\n    If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!\n    But come, I\'ll tell thee all my whole device\n    When I am in my coach, which stays for us\n    At the park gate; and therefore haste away,\n    For we must measure twenty miles to-day.              Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\nBelmont. The garden\n\nEnter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA\n\n  LAUNCELOT. Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father\nare to\n    be laid upon the children; therefore, I promise you, I fear\nyou.\n    I was always plain with you, and so now I speak my agitation\nof\n    the matter; therefore be o\' good cheer, for truly I think you\nare\n    damn\'d. There is but one hope in it that can do you any good,\nand\n    that is but a kind of bastard hope, neither.\n  JESSICA. And what hope is that, I pray thee?\n  LAUNCELOT. Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you\nnot-\n   that you are not the Jew\'s daughter.\n  JESSICA. That were a kind of bastard hope indeed; so the sins\nof my\n    mother should be visited upon me.\n  LAUNCELOT. Truly then I fear you are damn\'d both by father and\n    mother; thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into\n    Charybdis, your mother; well, you are gone both ways.\n  JESSICA. I shall be sav\'d by my husband; he hath made me a\n    Christian.\n  LAUNCELOT. Truly, the more to blame he; we were Christians enow\n\n    before, e\'en as many as could well live one by another. This\n    making of Christians will raise the price of hogs; if we grow\nall\n    to be pork-eaters, we shall not shortly have a rasher on the\n    coals for money.\n\n                             Enter LORENZO\n\n  JESSICA. I\'ll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say; here he\n    comes.\n  LORENZO. I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if you\n    thus get my wife into corners.\n  JESSICA. Nay, you need nor fear us, Lorenzo; Launcelot and I\nare\n    out; he tells me flatly there\'s no mercy for me in heaven,\n    because I am a Jew\'s daughter; and he says you are no good\nmember\n    of the commonwealth, for in converting Jews to Christians you\n    raise the price of pork.\n  LORENZO. I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than\nyou\n    can the getting up of the negro\'s belly; the Moor is with\nchild\n    by you, Launcelot.\n  LAUNCELOT. It is much that the Moor should be more than reason;\nbut \n    if she be less than an honest woman, she is indeed more than\nI\n    took her for.\n  LORENZO. How every fool can play upon the word! I think the\nbest\n    grace of wit will shortly turn into silence, and discourse\ngrow\n    commendable in none only but parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them\n    prepare for dinner.\n  LAUNCELOT. That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.\n  LORENZO. Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! Then bid them\n    prepare dinner.\n  LAUNCELOT. That is done too, sir, only \'cover\' is the word.\n  LORENZO. Will you cover, then, sir?\n  LAUNCELOT. Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.\n  LORENZO. Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show the\n    whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray thee understand\na\n    plain man in his plain meaning: go to thy fellows, bid them\ncover\n    the table, serve in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.\n  LAUNCELOT. For the table, sir, it shall be serv\'d in; for the\nmeat,\n    sir, it shall be cover\'d; for your coming in to dinner, sir,\nwhy,\n    let it be as humours and conceits shall govern.\n Exit \n  LORENZO. O dear discretion, how his words are suited!\n    The fool hath planted in his memory\n    An army of good words; and I do know\n    A many fools that stand in better place,\n    Garnish\'d like him, that for a tricksy word\n    Defy the matter. How cheer\'st thou, Jessica?\n    And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,\n    How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio\'s wife?\n  JESSICA. Past all expressing. It is very meet\n    The Lord Bassanio live an upright life,\n    For, having such a blessing in his lady,\n    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;\n    And if on earth he do not merit it,\n    In reason he should never come to heaven.\n    Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match,\n    And on the wager lay two earthly women,\n    And Portia one, there must be something else\n    Pawn\'d with the other; for the poor rude world\n    Hath not her fellow.\n  LORENZO. Even such a husband \n    Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.\n  JESSICA. Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.\n  LORENZO. I will anon; first let us go to dinner.\n  JESSICA. Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.\n  LORENZO. No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;\n    Then howsome\'er thou speak\'st, \'mong other things\n    I shall digest it.\n  JESSICA. Well, I\'ll set you forth.                      Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nACT IV. SCENE I.\nVenice. The court of justice\n\nEnter the DUKE, the MAGNIFICOES, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO,\nSALERIO,\nand OTHERS\n\n  DUKE OF VENICE. What, is Antonio here?\n  ANTONIO. Ready, so please your Grace.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. I am sorry for thee; thou art come to answer\n    A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch,\n    Uncapable of pity, void and empty\n    From any dram of mercy.\n  ANTONIO. I have heard\n    Your Grace hath ta\'en great pains to qualify\n    His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate,\n    And that no lawful means can carry me\n    Out of his envy\'s reach, I do oppose\n    My patience to his fury, and am arm\'d\n    To suffer with a quietness of spirit\n    The very tyranny and rage of his.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Go one, and call the Jew into the court.\n  SALERIO. He is ready at the door; he comes, my lord. \n\n                          Enter SHYLOCK\n\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Make room, and let him stand before our face.\n    Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,\n    That thou but leadest this fashion of thy malice\n    To the last hour of act; and then, \'tis thought,\n    Thou\'lt show thy mercy and remorse, more strange\n    Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;\n    And where thou now exacts the penalty,\n    Which is a pound of this poor merchant\'s flesh,\n    Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,\n    But, touch\'d with human gentleness and love,\n    Forgive a moiety of the principal,\n    Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,\n    That have of late so huddled on his back-\n    Enow to press a royal merchant down,\n    And pluck commiseration of his state\n    From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,\n    From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train\'d \n    To offices of tender courtesy.\n    We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.\n  SHYLOCK. I have possess\'d your Grace of what I purpose,\n    And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn\n    To have the due and forfeit of my bond.\n    If you deny it, let the danger light\n    Upon your charter and your city\'s freedom.\n    You\'ll ask me why I rather choose to have\n    A weight of carrion flesh than to receive\n    Three thousand ducats. I\'ll not answer that,\n    But say it is my humour- is it answer\'d?\n    What if my house be troubled with a rat,\n    And I be pleas\'d to give ten thousand ducats\n    To have it ban\'d? What, are you answer\'d yet?\n    Some men there are love not a gaping pig;\n    Some that are mad if they behold a cat;\n    And others, when the bagpipe sings i\' th\' nose,\n    Cannot contain their urine; for affection,\n    Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood\n    Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer: \n    As there is no firm reason to be rend\'red\n    Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;\n    Why he, a harmless necessary cat;\n    Why he, a woollen bagpipe, but of force\n    Must yield to such inevitable shame\n    As to offend, himself being offended;\n    So can I give no reason, nor I will not,\n    More than a lodg\'d hate and a certain loathing\n    I bear Antonio, that I follow thus\n    A losing suit against him. Are you answered?\n  BASSANIO. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,\n    To excuse the current of thy cruelty.\n  SHYLOCK. I am not bound to please thee with my answers.\n  BASSANIO. Do all men kill the things they do not love?\n  SHYLOCK. Hates any man the thing he would not kill?\n  BASSANIO. Every offence is not a hate at first.\n  SHYLOCK. What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?\n  ANTONIO. I pray you, think you question with the Jew.\n    You may as well go stand upon the beach\n    And bid the main flood bate his usual height; \n    You may as well use question with the wolf,\n    Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;\n    You may as well forbid the mountain pines\n    To wag their high tops and to make no noise\n    When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;\n    You may as well do anything most hard\n    As seek to soften that- than which what\'s harder?-\n    His jewish heart. Therefore, I do beseech you,\n    Make no moe offers, use no farther means,\n    But with all brief and plain conveniency\n    Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.\n  BASSANIO. For thy three thousand ducats here is six.\n  SHYLOCK. If every ducat in six thousand ducats\n    Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,\n    I would not draw them; I would have my bond.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend\'ring none?\n  SHYLOCK. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?\n    You have among you many a purchas\'d slave,\n    Which, fike your asses and your dogs and mules,\n    You use in abject and in slavish parts, \n    Because you bought them; shall I say to you\n    \'Let them be free, marry them to your heirs-\n    Why sweat they under burdens?- let their beds\n    Be made as soft as yours, and let their palates\n    Be season\'d with such viands\'? You will answer\n    \'The slaves are ours.\' So do I answer you:\n    The pound of flesh which I demand of him\n    Is dearly bought, \'tis mine, and I will have it.\n    If you deny me, fie upon your law!\n    There is no force in the decrees of Venice.\n    I stand for judgment; answer; shall I have it?\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Upon my power I may dismiss this court,\n    Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,\n    Whom I have sent for to determine this,\n    Come here to-day.\n  SALERIO. My lord, here stays without\n    A messenger with letters from the doctor,\n    New come from Padua.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Bring us the letters; call the messenger.\n  BASSANIO. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet! \n    The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all,\n    Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.\n  ANTONIO. I am a tainted wether of the flock,\n    Meetest for death; the weakest kind of fruit\n    Drops earliest to the ground, and so let me.\n    You cannot better be employ\'d, Bassanio,\n    Than to live still, and write mine epitaph.\n\n           Enter NERISSA dressed like a lawyer\'s clerk\n\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?\n  NERISSA. From both, my lord. Bellario greets your Grace.\n                                             [Presents a letter]\n  BASSANIO. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?\n  SHYLOCK. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.\n  GRATIANO. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,\n    Thou mak\'st thy knife keen; but no metal can,\n    No, not the hangman\'s axe, bear half the keenness\n    Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?\n  SHYLOCK. No, none that thou hast wit enough to make. \n  GRATIANO. O, be thou damn\'d, inexecrable dog!\n    And for thy life let justice be accus\'d.\n    Thou almost mak\'st me waver in my faith,\n    To hold opinion with Pythagoras\n    That souls of animals infuse themselves\n    Into the trunks of men. Thy currish spirit\n    Govern\'d a wolf who, hang\'d for human slaughter,\n    Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,\n    And, whilst thou layest in thy unhallowed dam,\n    Infus\'d itself in thee; for thy desires\n    Are wolfish, bloody, starv\'d and ravenous.\n  SHYLOCK. Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,\n    Thou but offend\'st thy lungs to speak so loud;\n    Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall\n    To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. This letter from Bellario doth commend\n    A young and learned doctor to our court.\n    Where is he?\n  NERISSA. He attendeth here hard by\n    To know your answer, whether you\'ll admit him. \n  DUKE OF VENICE. With all my heart. Some three or four of you\n    Go give him courteous conduct to this place.\n    Meantime, the court shall hear Bellario\'s letter.\n  CLERK.  [Reads]  \'Your Grace shall understand that at the\nreceipt\n    of your letter I am very sick; but in the instant that your\n    messenger came, in loving visitation was with me a young\ndoctor\n    of Rome- his name is Balthazar. I acquainted him with the\ncause\n    in controversy between the Jew and Antonio the merchant; we\n    turn\'d o\'er many books together; he is furnished with my\nopinion\n    which, bettered with his own learning-the greatness whereof I\n    cannot enough commend- comes with him at my importunity to\nfill\n    up your Grace\'s request in my stead. I beseech you let his\nlack\n    of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend\nestimation,\n    for I never knew so young a body with so old a head. I leave\nhim\n    to your gracious acceptance, whose trial shall better publish\nhis\n    commendation.\'\n\n      Enter PORTIA for BALTHAZAR, dressed like a Doctor of Laws\n\n  DUKE OF VENICE. YOU hear the learn\'d Bellario, what he writes; \n    And here, I take it, is the doctor come.\n    Give me your hand; come you from old Bellario?\n  PORTIA. I did, my lord.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. You are welcome; take your place.\n    Are you acquainted with the difference\n    That holds this present question in the court?\n  PORTIA. I am informed throughly of the cause.\n    Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.\n  PORTIA. Is your name Shylock?\n  SHYLOCK. Shylock is my name.\n  PORTIA. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;\n    Yet in such rule that the Venetian law\n    Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.\n    You stand within his danger, do you not?\n  ANTONIO. Ay, so he says.\n  PORTIA. Do you confess the bond?\n  ANTONIO. I do.\n  PORTIA. Then must the Jew be merciful.\n  SHYLOCK. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that. \n  PORTIA. The quality of mercy is not strain\'d;\n    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven\n    Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest:\n    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes.\n    \'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes\n    The throned monarch better than his crown;\n    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,\n    The attribute to awe and majesty,\n    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;\n    But mercy is above this sceptred sway,\n    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,\n    It is an attribute to God himself;\n    And earthly power doth then show likest God\'s\n    When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,\n    Though justice be thy plea, consider this-\n    That in the course of justice none of us\n    Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy,\n    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render\n    The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much\n    To mitigate the justice of thy plea, \n    Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice\n    Must needs give sentence \'gainst the merchant there.\n  SHYLOCK. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,\n    The penalty and forfeit of my bond.\n  BASSANIO. Yes; here I tender it for him in the court;\n    Yea, twice the sum; if that will not suffice,\n    I will be bound to pay it ten times o\'er\n    On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart;\n    If this will not suffice, it must appear\n    That malice bears down truth. And, I beseech you,\n    Wrest once the law to your authority;\n    To do a great right do a little wrong,\n    And curb this cruel devil of his will.\n  PORTIA. It must not be; there is no power in Venice\n    Can alter a decree established;\n    \'Twill be recorded for a precedent,\n    And many an error, by the same example,\n    Will rush into the state; it cannot be.\n  SHYLOCK. A Daniel come to judgment! Yea, a Daniel!\n    O wise young judge, how I do honour thee! \n  PORTIA. I pray you, let me look upon the bond.\n  SHYLOCK. Here \'tis, most reverend Doctor; here it is.\n  PORTIA. Shylock, there\'s thrice thy money off\'red thee.\n  SHYLOCK. An oath, an oath! I have an oath in heaven.\n    Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?\n    No, not for Venice.\n  PORTIA. Why, this bond is forfeit;\n    And lawfully by this the Jew may claim\n    A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off\n    Nearest the merchant\'s heart. Be merciful.\n    Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.\n  SHYLOCK. When it is paid according to the tenour.\n    It doth appear you are a worthy judge;\n    You know the law; your exposition\n    Hath been most sound; I charge you by the law,\n    Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,\n    Proceed to judgment. By my soul I swear\n    There is no power in the tongue of man\n    To alter me. I stay here on my bond.\n  ANTONIO. Most heartily I do beseech the court \n    To give the judgment.\n  PORTIA. Why then, thus it is:\n    You must prepare your bosom for his knife.\n  SHYLOCK. O noble judge! O excellent young man!\n  PORTIA. For the intent and purpose of the law\n    Hath full relation to the penalty,\n    Which here appeareth due upon the bond.\n  SHYLOCK. \'Tis very true. O wise and upright judge,\n    How much more elder art thou than thy looks!\n  PORTIA. Therefore, lay bare your bosom.\n  SHYLOCK. Ay, his breast-\n    So says the bond; doth it not, noble judge?\n    \'Nearest his heart,\' those are the very words.\n  PORTIA. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh\n    The flesh?\n  SHYLOCK. I have them ready.\n  PORTIA. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,\n    To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.\n  SHYLOCK. Is it so nominated in the bond?\n  PORTIA. It is not so express\'d, but what of that? \n    \'Twere good you do so much for charity.\n  SHYLOCK. I cannot find it; \'tis not in the bond.\n  PORTIA. You, merchant, have you anything to say?\n  ANTONIO. But little: I am arm\'d and well prepar\'d.\n    Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well.\n    Grieve not that I am fall\'n to this for you,\n    For herein Fortune shows herself more kind\n    Than is her custom. It is still her use\n    To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,\n    To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow\n    An age of poverty; from which ling\'ring penance\n    Of such misery doth she cut me off.\n    Commend me to your honourable wife;\n    Tell her the process of Antonio\'s end;\n    Say how I lov\'d you; speak me fair in death;\n    And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge\n    Whether Bassanio had not once a love.\n    Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,\n    And he repents not that he pays your debt;\n    For if the Jew do cut but deep enough, \n    I\'ll pay it instantly with all my heart.\n  BASSANIO. Antonio, I am married to a wife\n    Which is as dear to me as life itself;\n    But life itself, my wife, and all the world,\n    Are not with me esteem\'d above thy life;\n    I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all\n    Here to this devil, to deliver you.\n  PORTIA. Your wife would give you little thanks for that,\n    If she were by to hear you make the offer.\n  GRATIANO. I have a wife who I protest I love;\n    I would she were in heaven, so she could\n    Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.\n  NERISSA. \'Tis well you offer it behind her back;\n    The wish would make else an unquiet house.\n  SHYLOCK.  [Aside]  These be the Christian husbands! I have a\n    daughter-\n    Would any of the stock of Barrabas\n    Had been her husband, rather than a Christian!-\n    We trifle time; I pray thee pursue sentence.\n  PORTIA. A pound of that same merchant\'s flesh is thine. \n    The court awards it and the law doth give it.\n  SHYLOCK. Most rightful judge!\n  PORTIA. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast.\n    The law allows it and the court awards it.\n  SHYLOCK. Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare.\n  PORTIA. Tarry a little; there is something else.\n    This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood:\n    The words expressly are \'a pound of flesh.\'\n    Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;\n    But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed\n    One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods\n    Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate\n    Unto the state of Venice.\n  GRATIANO. O upright judge! Mark, Jew. O learned judge!\n  SHYLOCK. Is that the law?\n  PORTIA. Thyself shalt see the act;\n    For, as thou urgest justice, be assur\'d\n    Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desir\'st.\n  GRATIANO. O learned judge! Mark, Jew. A learned judge!\n  SHYLOCK. I take this offer then: pay the bond thrice, \n    And let the Christian go.\n  BASSANIO. Here is the money.\n  PORTIA. Soft!\n    The Jew shall have all justice. Soft! No haste.\n    He shall have nothing but the penalty.\n  GRATIANO. O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!\n  PORTIA. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the flesh.\n    Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more\n    But just a pound of flesh; if thou tak\'st more\n    Or less than a just pound- be it but so much\n    As makes it light or heavy in the substance,\n    Or the division of the twentieth part\n    Of one poor scruple; nay, if the scale do turn\n    But in the estimation of a hair-\n    Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.\n  GRATIANO. A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!\n    Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.\n  PORTIA. Why doth the Jew pause? Take thy forfeiture.\n  SHYLOCK. Give me my principal, and let me go.\n  BASSANIO. I have it ready for thee; here it is. \n  PORTIA. He hath refus\'d it in the open court;\n    He shall have merely justice, and his bond.\n  GRATIANO. A Daniel still say I, a second Daniel!\n    I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.\n  SHYLOCK. Shall I not have barely my principal?\n  PORTIA. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture\n    To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.\n  SHYLOCK. Why, then the devil give him good of it!\n    I\'ll stay no longer question.\n  PORTIA. Tarry, Jew.\n    The law hath yet another hold on you.\n    It is enacted in the laws of Venice,\n    If it be proved against an alien\n    That by direct or indirect attempts\n    He seek the life of any citizen,\n    The party \'gainst the which he doth contrive\n    Shall seize one half his goods; the other half\n    Comes to the privy coffer of the state;\n    And the offender\'s life lies in the mercy\n    Of the Duke only, \'gainst all other voice. \n    In which predicament, I say, thou stand\'st;\n    For it appears by manifest proceeding\n    That indirectly, and directly too,\n    Thou hast contrived against the very life\n    Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr\'d\n    The danger formerly by me rehears\'d.\n    Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.\n  GRATIANO. Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself;\n    And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,\n    Thou hast not left the value of a cord;\n    Therefore thou must be hang\'d at the state\'s charge.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. That thou shalt see the difference of our\nspirit,\n    I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.\n    For half thy wealth, it is Antonio\'s;\n    The other half comes to the general state,\n    Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.\n  PORTIA. Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.\n  SHYLOCK. Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that.\n    You take my house when you do take the prop\n    That doth sustain my house; you take my life \n    When you do take the means whereby I live.\n  PORTIA. What mercy can you render him, Antonio?\n  GRATIANO. A halter gratis; nothing else, for God\'s sake!\n  ANTONIO. So please my lord the Duke and all the court\n    To quit the fine for one half of his goods;\n    I am content, so he will let me have\n    The other half in use, to render it\n    Upon his death unto the gentleman\n    That lately stole his daughter-\n    Two things provided more; that, for this favour,\n    He presently become a Christian;\n    The other, that he do record a gift,\n    Here in the court, of all he dies possess\'d\n    Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. He shall do this, or else I do recant\n    The pardon that I late pronounced here.\n  PORTIA. Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?\n  SHYLOCK. I am content.\n  PORTIA. Clerk, draw a deed of gift.\n  SHYLOCK. I pray you, give me leave to go from hence; \n    I am not well; send the deed after me\n    And I will sign it.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Get thee gone, but do it.\n  GRATIANO. In christ\'ning shalt thou have two god-fathers;\n    Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,\n    To bring thee to the gallows, not to the font.\n                                                    Exit SHYLOCK\n  DUKE OF VENICE. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.\n  PORTIA. I humbly do desire your Grace of pardon;\n    I must away this night toward Padua,\n    And it is meet I presently set forth.\n  DUKE OF VENICE. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.\n    Antonio, gratify this gentleman,\n    For in my mind you are much bound to him.\n                             Exeunt DUKE, MAGNIFICOES, and train\n  BASSANIO. Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend\n    Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted\n    Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof\n    Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,\n    We freely cope your courteous pains withal. \n  ANTONIO. And stand indebted, over and above,\n    In love and service to you evermore.\n  PORTIA. He is well paid that is well satisfied,\n    And I, delivering you, am satisfied,\n    And therein do account myself well paid.\n    My mind was never yet more mercenary.\n    I pray you, know me when we meet again;\n    I wish you well, and so I take my leave.\n  BASSANIO. Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further;\n    Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,\n    Not as fee. Grant me two things, I pray you,\n    Not to deny me, and to pardon me.\n  PORTIA. You press me far, and therefore I will yield.\n    [To ANTONIO]  Give me your gloves, I\'ll wear them for your\nsake.\n    [To BASSANIO]  And, for your love, I\'ll take this ring from\nyou.\n    Do not draw back your hand; I\'ll take no more,\n    And you in love shall not deny me this.\n  BASSANIO. This ring, good sir- alas, it is a trifle;\n    I will not shame myself to give you this.\n  PORTIA. I will have nothing else but only this; \n    And now, methinks, I have a mind to it.\n  BASSANIO.. There\'s more depends on this than on the value.\n    The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,\n    And find it out by proclamation;\n    Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.\n  PORTIA. I see, sir, you are liberal in offers;\n    You taught me first to beg, and now, methinks,\n    You teach me how a beggar should be answer\'d.\n  BASSANIO. Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;\n    And, when she put it on, she made me vow\n    That I should neither sell, nor give, nor lose it.\n  PORTIA. That \'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.\n    And if your wife be not a mad woman,\n    And know how well I have deserv\'d this ring,\n    She would not hold out enemy for ever\n    For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!\n                                       Exeunt PORTIA and NERISSA\n  ANTONIO. My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring.\n    Let his deservings, and my love withal,\n    Be valued \'gainst your wife\'s commandment. \n  BASSANIO. Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;\n    Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,\n    Unto Antonio\'s house. Away, make haste.        Exit GRATIANO\n    Come, you and I will thither presently;\n    And in the morning early will we both\n    Fly toward Belmont. Come, Antonio.                    Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nVenice. A street\n\nEnter PORTIA and NERISSA\n\n  PORTIA. Inquire the Jew\'s house out, give him this deed,\n    And let him sign it; we\'ll away tonight,\n    And be a day before our husbands home.\n    This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.\n\n                          Enter GRATIANO\n\n  GRATIANO. Fair sir, you are well o\'erta\'en.\n    My Lord Bassanio, upon more advice,\n    Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat\n    Your company at dinner.\n  PORTIA. That cannot be.\n    His ring I do accept most thankfully,\n    And so, I pray you, tell him. Furthermore,\n    I pray you show my youth old Shylock\'s house.\n  GRATIANO. That will I do.\n  NERISSA. Sir, I would speak with you. \n    [Aside to PORTIA]  I\'ll See if I can get my husband\'s ring,\n    Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.\n  PORTIA.  [To NERISSA]  Thou Mayst, I warrant. We shall have old\n      swearing\n    That they did give the rings away to men;\n    But we\'ll outface them, and outswear them too.\n    [Aloud]  Away, make haste, thou know\'st where I will tarry.\n  NERISSA. Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?\n                                                          Exeunt\n\n\n\n\nACT V. SCENE I.\nBelmont. The garden before PORTIA\'S house\n\nEnter LORENZO and JESSICA\n\n  LORENZO. The moon shines bright. In such a night as this,\n    When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees,\n    And they did make no noise- in such a night,\n    Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls,\n    And sigh\'d his soul toward the Grecian tents,\n    Where Cressid lay that night.\n  JESSICA. In such a night\n    Did Thisby fearfully o\'ertrip the dew,\n    And saw the lion\'s shadow ere himself,\n    And ran dismayed away.\n  LORENZO. In such a night\n    Stood Dido with a willow in her hand\n    Upon the wild sea-banks, and waft her love\n    To come again to Carthage.\n  JESSICA. In such a night\n    Medea gathered the enchanted herbs\n    That did renew old AEson.\n LORENZO. In such a night \n    Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew,\n    And with an unthrift love did run from Venice\n    As far as Belmont.\n  JESSICA. In such a night\n    Did young Lorenzo swear he lov\'d her well,\n    Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,\n    And ne\'er a true one.\n  LORENZO. In such a night\n    Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,\n    Slander her love, and he forgave it her.\n  JESSICA. I would out-night you, did no body come;\n    But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.\n\n                       Enter STEPHANO\n\n  LORENZO. Who comes so fast in silence of the night?\n  STEPHANO. A friend.\n  LORENZO. A friend! What friend? Your name, I pray you, friend?\n  STEPHANO. Stephano is my name, and I bring word\n    My mistress will before the break of day \n    Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about\n    By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays\n    For happy wedlock hours.\n  LORENZO. Who comes with her?\n  STEPHANO. None but a holy hermit and her maid.\n    I pray you, is my master yet return\'d?\n  LORENZO. He is not, nor we have not heard from him.\n    But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,\n    And ceremoniously let us prepare\n    Some welcome for the mistress of the house.\n\n                         Enter LAUNCELOT\n\n  LAUNCELOT. Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!\n  LORENZO. Who calls?\n  LAUNCELOT. Sola! Did you see Master Lorenzo? Master Lorenzo!\nSola,\n    sola!\n  LORENZO. Leave holloaing, man. Here!\n  LAUNCELOT. Sola! Where, where?\n  LORENZO. Here! \n  LAUNCELOT. Tell him there\'s a post come from my master with his\n    horn full of good news; my master will be here ere morning.\n Exit\n  LORENZO. Sweet soul, let\'s in, and there expect their coming.\n    And yet no matter- why should we go in?\n    My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,\n    Within the house, your mistress is at hand;\n    And bring your music forth into the air.       Exit STEPHANO\n    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!\n    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music\n    Creep in our ears; soft stillness and the night\n    Become the touches of sweet harmony.\n    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven\n    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;\n    There\'s not the smallest orb which thou behold\'st\n    But in his motion like an angel sings,\n    Still quiring to the young-ey\'d cherubins;\n    Such harmony is in immortal souls,\n    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay\n    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it. \n\n                          Enter MUSICIANS\n\n    Come, ho, and wake Diana with a hymn;\n    With sweetest touches pierce your mistress\' ear.\n    And draw her home with music.                        [Music]\n  JESSICA. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.\n  LORENZO. The reason is your spirits are attentive;\n    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,\n    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,\n    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,\n    Which is the hot condition of their blood-\n    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,\n    Or any air of music touch their ears,\n    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,\n    Their savage eyes turn\'d to a modest gaze\n    By the sweet power of music. Therefore the poet\n    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods;\n    Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,\n    But music for the time doth change his nature. \n    The man that hath no music in himself,\n    Nor is not mov\'d with concord of sweet sounds,\n    Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;\n    The motions of his spirit are dull:as night,\n    And his affections dark as Erebus.\n    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.\n\n                    Enter PORTIA and NERISSA\n\n  PORTIA. That light we see is burning in my hall.\n    How far that little candle throws his beams!\n    So shines a good deed in a naughty world.\n  NERISSA. When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.\n  PORTIA. So doth the greater glory dim the less:\n    A substitute shines brightly as a king\n    Until a king be by, and then his state\n    Empties itself, as doth an inland brook\n    Into the main of waters. Music! hark!\n  NERISSA. It is your music, madam, of the house.\n  PORTIA. Nothing is good, I see, without respect; \n    Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.\n  NERISSA. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.\n  PORTIA. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark\n    When neither is attended; and I think\n    ne nightingale, if she should sing by day,\n    When every goose is cackling, would be thought\n    No better a musician than the wren.\n    How many things by season season\'d are\n    To their right praise and true perfection!\n    Peace, ho! The moon sleeps with Endymion,\n    And would not be awak\'d.                      [Music ceases]\n  LORENZO. That is the voice,\n    Or I am much deceiv\'d, of Portia.\n  PORTIA. He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,\n    By the bad voice.\n  LORENZO. Dear lady, welcome home.\n  PORTIA. We have been praying for our husbands\' welfare,\n    Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.\n    Are they return\'d?\n  LORENZO. Madam, they are not yet; \n    But there is come a messenger before,\n    To signify their coming.\n  PORTIA.. Go in, Nerissa;\n    Give order to my servants that they take\n    No note at all of our being absent hence;\n    Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.        [A tucket sounds]\n  LORENZO. Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet.\n    We are no tell-tales, madam, fear you not.\n  PORTIA. This night methinks is but the daylight sick;\n    It looks a little paler; \'tis a day\n    Such as the day is when the sun is hid.\n\n       Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers\n\n  BASSANIO. We should hold day with the Antipodes,\n    If you would walk in absence of the sun.\n  PORTIA. Let me give light, but let me not be light,\n    For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,\n    And never be Bassanio so for me;\n    But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord. \n  BASSANIO. I thank you, madam; give welcome to my friend.\n    This is the man, this is Antonio,\n    To whom I am so infinitely bound.\n  PORTIA. You should in all sense be much bound to him,\n    For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.\n  ANTONIO. No more than I am well acquitted of.\n  PORTIA. Sir, you are very welcome to our house.\n    It must appear in other ways than words,\n    Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.\n  GRATIANO.  [To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me\nwrong;\n    In faith, I gave it to the judge\'s clerk.\n    Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,\n    Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.\n  PORTIA. A quarrel, ho, already! What\'s the matter?\n  GRATIANO. About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring\n    That she did give me, whose posy was\n    For all the world like cutler\'s poetry\n    Upon a knife, \'Love me, and leave me not.\'\n  NERISSA. What talk you of the posy or the value?\n    You swore to me, when I did give it you, \n    That you would wear it till your hour of death,\n    And that it should lie with you in your grave;\n    Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,\n    You should have been respective and have kept it.\n    Gave it a judge\'s clerk! No, God\'s my judge,\n    The clerk will ne\'er wear hair on\'s face that had it.\n  GRATIANO. He will, an if he live to be a man.\n  NERISSA. Ay, if a woman live to be a man.\n  GRATIANO. Now by this hand I gave it to a youth,\n    A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy\n    No higher than thyself, the judge\'s clerk;\n    A prating boy that begg\'d it as a fee;\n    I could not for my heart deny it him.\n  PORTIA. You were to blame, I must be plain with you,\n    To part so slightly with your wife\'s first gift,\n    A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger\n    And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.\n    I gave my love a ring, and made him swear\n    Never to part with it, and here he stands;\n    I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it \n    Nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth\n    That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,\n    You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief;\n    An \'twere to me, I should be mad at it.\n  BASSANIO.  [Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off,\n    And swear I lost the ring defending it.\n  GRATIANO. My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away\n    Unto the judge that begg\'d it, and indeed\n    Deserv\'d it too; and then the boy, his clerk,\n    That took some pains in writing, he begg\'d mine;\n    And neither man nor master would take aught\n    But the two rings.\n  PORTIA. What ring gave you, my lord?\n    Not that, I hope, which you receiv\'d of me.\n  BASSANIO. If I could add a lie unto a fault,\n    I would deny it; but you see my finger\n    Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.\n  PORTIA. Even so void is your false heart of truth;\n    By heaven, I will ne\'er come in your bed\n    Until I see the ring. \n  NERISSA. Nor I in yours\n    Till I again see mine.\n  BASSANIO. Sweet Portia,\n    If you did know to whom I gave the ring,\n    If you did know for whom I gave the ring,\n    And would conceive for what I gave the ring,\n    And how unwillingly I left the ring,\n    When nought would be accepted but the ring,\n    You would abate the strength of your displeasure.\n  PORTIA. If you had known the virtue of the ring,\n    Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,\n    Or your own honour to contain the ring,\n    You would not then have parted with the ring.\n    What man is there so much unreasonable,\n    If you had pleas\'d to have defended it\n    With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty\n    To urge the thing held as a ceremony?\n    Nerissa teaches me what to believe:\n    I\'ll die for\'t but some woman had the ring.\n  BASSANIO. No, by my honour, madam, by my soul, \n    No woman had it, but a civil doctor,\n    Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me,\n    And begg\'d the ring; the which I did deny him,\n    And suffer\'d him to go displeas\'d away-\n    Even he that had held up the very life\n    Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?\n    I was enforc\'d to send it after him;\n    I was beset with shame and courtesy;\n    My honour would not let ingratitude\n    So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;\n    For by these blessed candles of the night,\n    Had you been there, I think you would have begg\'d\n    The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.\n  PORTIA. Let not that doctor e\'er come near my house;\n    Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,\n    And that which you did swear to keep for me,\n    I will become as liberal as you;\n    I\'ll not deny him anything I have,\n    No, not my body, nor my husband\'s bed.\n    Know him I shall, I am well sure of it. \n    Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus;\n    If you do not, if I be left alone,\n    Now, by mine honour which is yet mine own,\n    I\'ll have that doctor for mine bedfellow.\n  NERISSA. And I his clerk; therefore be well advis\'d\n    How you do leave me to mine own protection.\n  GRATIANO. Well, do you so, let not me take him then;\n    For, if I do, I\'ll mar the young clerk\'s pen.\n  ANTONIO. I am th\' unhappy subject of these quarrels.\n  PORTIA. Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome not withstanding.\n  BASSANIO. Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;\n    And in the hearing of these many friends\n    I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,\n    Wherein I see myself-\n  PORTIA. Mark you but that!\n    In both my eyes he doubly sees himself,\n    In each eye one; swear by your double self,\n    And there\'s an oath of credit.\n  BASSANIO. Nay, but hear me.\n    Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear \n    I never more will break an oath with thee.\n  ANTONIO. I once did lend my body for his wealth,\n    Which, but for him that had your husband\'s ring,\n    Had quite miscarried; I dare be bound again,\n    My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord\n    Will never more break faith advisedly.\n  PORTIA. Then you shall be his surety. Give him this,\n    And bid him keep it better than the other.\n  ANTONIO. Here, Lord Bassanio, swear to keep this ring.\n  BASSANIO. By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!\n  PORTIA. I had it of him. Pardon me, Bassanio,\n    For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.\n  NERISSA. And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano,\n    For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor\'s clerk,\n    In lieu of this, last night did lie with me.\n  GRATIANO. Why, this is like the mending of highways\n    In summer, where the ways are fair enough.\n    What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserv\'d it?\n  PORTIA. Speak not so grossly. You are all amaz\'d.\n    Here is a letter; read it at your leisure; \n    It comes from Padua, from Bellario;\n    There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,\n    Nerissa there her clerk. Lorenzo here\n    Shall witness I set forth as soon as you,\n    And even but now return\'d; I have not yet\n    Enter\'d my house. Antonio, you are welcome;\n    And I have better news in store for you\n    Than you expect. Unseal this letter soon;\n    There you shall find three of your argosies\n    Are richly come to harbour suddenly.\n    You shall not know by what strange accident\n    I chanced on this letter.\n  ANTONIO. I am dumb.\n  BASSANIO. Were you the doctor, and I knew you not?\n  GRATIANO. Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?\n  NERISSA. Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,\n    Unless he live until he be a man.\n  BASSANIO. Sweet doctor, you shall be my bedfellow;\n    When I am absent, then lie with my wife.\n  ANTONIO. Sweet lady, you have given me life and living; \n    For here I read for certain that my ships\n    Are safely come to road.\n  PORTIA. How now, Lorenzo!\n    My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.\n  NERISSA. Ay, and I\'ll give them him without a fee.\n    There do I give to you and Jessica,\n    From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,\n    After his death, of all he dies possess\'d of.\n  LORENZO. Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way\n    Of starved people.\n  PORTIA. It is almost morning,\n    And yet I am sure you are not satisfied\n    Of these events at full. Let us go in,\n    And charge us there upon inter\'gatories,\n    And we will answer all things faithfully.\n  GRATIANO. Let it be so. The first inter\'gatory\n    That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,\n    Whether till the next night she had rather stay,\n    Or go to bed now, being two hours to day.\n    But were the day come, I should wish it dark, \n    Till I were couching with the doctor\'s clerk.\n    Well, while I live, I\'ll fear no other thing\n    So sore as keeping safe Nerissa\'s ring.               Exeunt\n\nTHE END\n\n\n'

S"\nAs you Like it\n\nActus primus. Scoena Prima.\n\nEnter Orlando and Adam.\n\n  Orlando. As I remember Adam, it was vpon this fashion\nbequeathed me by will, but poore a thousand\nCrownes, and as thou saist, charged my brother\non his blessing to breed mee well: and\nthere begins my sadnesse: My brother Iaques he keepes\nat schoole, and report speakes goldenly of his profit:\nfor my part, he keepes me rustically at home, or (to speak\nmore properly) staies me heere at home vnkept: for call\nyou that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs\nnot from the stalling of an Oxe? his horses are bred\nbetter, for besides that they are faire with their feeding,\nthey are taught their mannage, and to that end Riders\ndeerely hir'd: but I (his brother) gaine nothing vnder\nhim but growth, for the which his Animals on his\ndunghils are as much bound to him as I: besides this nothing\nthat he so plentifully giues me, the something that\nnature gaue mee, his countenance seemes to take from\nme: hee lets mee feede with his Hindes, barres mee the\nplace of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my\ngentility with my education. This is it Adam that\ngrieues me, and the spirit of my Father, which I thinke\nis within mee, begins to mutinie against this seruitude.\nI will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise\nremedy how to auoid it.\nEnter Oliuer.\n\n  Adam. Yonder comes my Master, your brother\n\n   Orlan. Goe a-part Adam, and thou shalt heare how\nhe will shake me vp\n\n   Oli. Now Sir, what make you heere?\n  Orl. Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing\n\n   Oli. What mar you then sir?\n  Orl. Marry sir, I am helping you to mar that which\nGod made, a poore vnworthy brother of yours with\nidlenesse\n\n   Oliuer. Marry sir be better employed, and be naught\na while\n\n   Orlan. Shall I keepe your hogs, and eat huskes with\nthem? what prodigall portion haue I spent, that I should\ncome to such penury?\n  Oli. Know you where you are sir?\n  Orl. O sir, very well: heere in your Orchard\n\n   Oli. Know you before whom sir?\n  Orl. I, better then him I am before knowes mee: I\nknow you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition\nof bloud you should so know me: the courtesie of\nnations allowes you my better, in that you are the first\nborne, but the same tradition takes not away my bloud,\nwere there twenty brothers betwixt vs: I haue as much\nof my father in mee, as you, albeit I confesse your comming\nbefore me is neerer to his reuerence\n\n   Oli. What Boy\n\n   Orl. Come, come elder brother, you are too yong in this\n\n   Oli. Wilt thou lay hands on me villaine?\n  Orl. I am no villaine: I am the yongest sonne of Sir\nRowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is thrice a villaine\nthat saies such a father begot villaines: wert thou\nnot my brother, I would not take this hand from thy\nthroat, till this other had puld out thy tongue for saying\nso, thou hast raild on thy selfe\n\n   Adam. Sweet Masters bee patient, for your Fathers\nremembrance, be at accord\n\n   Oli. Let me goe I say\n\n   Orl. I will not till I please: you shall heare mee: my\nfather charg'd you in his will to giue me good education:\nyou haue train'd me like a pezant, obscuring and\nhiding from me all gentleman-like qualities: the spirit\nof my father growes strong in mee, and I will no longer\nendure it: therefore allow me such exercises as may become\na gentleman, or giue mee the poore allottery my\nfather left me by testament, with that I will goe buy my\nfortunes\n\n   Oli. And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent?\nWell sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with\nyou: you shall haue some part of your will, I pray you\nleaue me\n\n   Orl. I will no further offend you, then becomes mee\nfor my good\n\n   Oli. Get you with him, you olde dogge\n\n   Adam.

Is it euen so, begin you to grow vpon me? I will\nphysicke your ranckenesse, and yet giue no thousand\ncrownes neyther: holla Dennis.\nEnter Dennis.\n\n  Den. Calls your worship?\n  Oli. Was not Charles the Dukes Wrastler heere to\nspeake with me?\n  Den. So please you, he is heere at the doore, and importunes\naccesse to you\n\n   Oli. Call him in: 'twill be a good way: and to morrow\nthe wrastling is.\nEnter Charles.\n\n  Cha. Good morrow to your worship\n\n   Oli. Good Mounsier Charles: what's the new newes\nat the new Court?\n  Charles. There's no newes at the Court Sir, but the\nolde newes: that is, the old Duke is banished by his yonger\nbrother the new Duke, and three or foure louing\nLords haue put themselues into voluntary exile with\nhim, whose lands and reuenues enrich the new Duke,\ntherefore he giues them good leaue to wander\n\n   Oli. Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter bee\nbanished with her Father?\n  Cha. O no; for the Dukes daughter her Cosen so\nloues her, being euer from their Cradles bred together,\nthat hee would haue followed her exile, or haue died to\nstay behind her; she is at the Court, and no lesse beloued\nof her Vncle, then his owne daughter, and neuer two Ladies\nloued as they doe\n\n   Oli. Where will the old Duke liue?\n  Cha. They say hee is already in the Forrest of Arden,\nand a many merry men with him; and there they liue\nlike the old Robin Hood of England: they say many yong\nGentlemen flocke to him euery day, and fleet the time\ncarelesly as they did in the golden world\n\n   Oli. What, you wrastle to morrow before the new\nDuke\n\n   Cha. Marry doe I sir: and I came to acquaint you\nwith a matter: I am giuen sir secretly to vnderstand, that\nyour yonger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come\nin disguis'd against mee to try a fall: to morrow sir I\nwrastle for my credit, and hee that escapes me without\nsome broken limbe, shall acquit him well: your brother\nis but young and tender, and for your loue I would bee\nloth to foyle him, as I must for my owne honour if hee\ncome in: therefore out of my loue to you, I came hither\nto acquaint you withall, that either you might stay him\nfrom his intendment, or brooke such disgrace well as he\nshall runne into, in that it is a thing of his owne search,\nand altogether against my will\n\n   Oli. Charles , I thanke thee for thy loue to me, which\nthou shalt finde I will most kindly requite: I had my\nselfe notice of my Brothers purpose heerein, and haue by\nvnder-hand meanes laboured to disswade him from it;\nbut he is resolute. Ile tell thee Charles, it is the stubbornest\nyong fellow of France, full of ambition, an enuious\nemulator of euery mans good parts, a secret & villanous\ncontriuer against mee his naturall brother: therefore vse\nthy discretion, I had as liefe thou didst breake his necke\nas his finger. And thou wert best looke to't; for if thou\ndost him any slight disgrace, or if hee doe not mightilie\ngrace himselfe on thee, hee will practise against thee by\npoyson, entrap thee by some treacherous deuise, and neuer\nleaue thee till he hath tane thy life by some indirect\nmeanes or other: for I assure thee, (and almost with\nteares I speake it) there is not one so young, and so villanous\nthis day liuing. I speake but brotherly of him,\nbut should I anathomize him to thee, as hee is, I must\nblush, and weepe, and thou must looke pale and\nwonder\n\n   Cha. I am heartily glad I came hither to you: if hee\ncome to morrow, Ile giue him his payment: if euer hee\ngoe alone againe, Ile neuer wrastle for prize more: and\nso God keepe your worship.\nEnter.\n\nFarewell good Charles. Now will I stirre this Gamester:\nI hope I shall see an end of him; for my soule (yet\nI know not why) hates nothing more then he: yet hee's\ngentle, neuer school'd, and yet learned, full of noble\ndeuise, of all sorts enchantingly beloued, and indeed\nso much in the heart of the world, and especially of my\nowne people, who best know him, that I am altogether\nmisprised: but it shall not be so long, this wrastler shall\ncleare all: nothing remaines, but that I kindle the boy\nthither, which now Ile goe about.\nEnter.\n\n\nScoena Secunda.\n\nEnter Rosalind, and Cellia.\n\n  Cel. I pray thee Rosalind, sweet my Coz, be merry\n\n   Ros. Deere Cellia; I show more mirth then I am mistresse\nof, and would you yet were merrier: vnlesse you\ncould teach me to forget a banished father, you must not\nlearne mee how to remember any extraordinary pleasure\n\n   Cel. Heerein I see thou lou'st mee not with the full\nwaight that I loue thee; if my Vncle thy banished father\nhad banished thy Vncle the Duke my Father, so thou\nhadst beene still with mee, I could haue taught my loue\nto take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth\nof thy loue to me were so righteously temper'd, as mine\nis to thee\n\n   Ros. Well, I will forget the condition of my estate,\nto reioyce in yours\n\n   Cel. You know my Father hath no childe, but I, nor\nnone is like to haue; and truely when he dies, thou shalt\nbe his heire; for what hee hath taken away from thy father\nperforce, I will render thee againe in affection: by\nmine honor I will, and when I breake that oath, let mee\nturne monster: therefore my sweet Rose, my deare Rose,\nbe merry\n\n   Ros. From henceforth I will Coz, and deuise sports:\nlet me see, what thinke you of falling in Loue?\n  Cel. Marry I prethee doe, to make sport withall: but\nloue no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neyther,\nthen with safety of a pure blush, thou maist in honor\ncome off againe\n\n   Ros. What shall be our sport then?\n  Cel. Let vs sit and mocke the good houswife Fortune\nfrom her wheele, that her gifts may henceforth bee\nbestowed equally\n\n   Ros. I would wee could doe so: for her benefits are\nmightily misplaced, and the bountifull blinde woman\ndoth most mistake in her gifts to women\n\n   Cel. 'Tis true, for those that she makes faire, she scarce\nmakes honest, & those that she makes honest, she makes\nvery illfauouredly\n\n   Ros. Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures:\nFortune reignes in gifts of the world, not in the\nlineaments of Nature.\nEnter Clowne.\n\n  Cel. No; when Nature hath made a faire creature,\nmay she not by Fortune fall into the fire? though nature\nhath giuen vs wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune\nsent in this foole to cut off the argument?\n  Ros. Indeed there is fortune too hard for nature, when\nfortune makes natures naturall, the cutter off of natures\nwitte\n\n   Cel. Peraduenture this is not Fortunes work neither,\nbut Natures, who perceiueth our naturall wits too dull\nto reason of such goddesses, hath sent this Naturall for\nour whetstone: for alwaies the dulnesse of the foole, is\nthe whetstone of the wits. How now Witte, whether\nwander you?\n  Clow. Mistresse, you must come away to your father\n\n   Cel. Were you made the messenger?\n  Clo. No by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you\n  Ros. Where learned you that oath foole?\n  Clo. Of a certaine Knight, that swore by his Honour\nthey were good Pan-cakes, and swore by his Honor the\nMustard was naught: Now Ile stand to it, the Pancakes\nwere naught, and the Mustard was good, and yet was\nnot the Knight forsworne\n\n   Cel. How proue you that in the great heape of your\nknowledge?\n  Ros. I marry, now vnmuzzle your wisedome\n\n   Clo. Stand you both forth now: stroke your chinnes,\nand sweare by your beards that I am a knaue\n\n   Cel. By our beards (if we had them) thou art\n\n   Clo. By my knauerie (if I had it) then I were: but if\nyou sweare by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no\nmore was this knight swearing by his Honor, for he neuer\nhad anie; or if he had, he had sworne it away, before\neuer he saw those Pancakes, or that Mustard\n\n   Cel. Prethee, who is't that thou means't?\n  Clo. One that old Fredericke your Father loues\n\n   Ros. My Fathers loue is enough to honor him enough;\nspeake no more of him, you'l be whipt for taxation one\nof these daies\n\n   Clo. The more pittie that fooles may not speak wisely,\nwhat Wisemen do foolishly\n\n   Cel. By my troth thou saiest true: For, since the little\nwit that fooles haue was silenced, the little foolerie that\nwise men haue makes a great shew; Heere comes Monsieur\nthe Beu.\nEnter le Beau.\n\n  Ros. With his mouth full of newes\n\n   Cel. Which he will put on vs, as Pigeons feed their\nyoung\n\n   Ros. Then shal we be newes-cram'd\n\n   Cel. All the better: we shalbe the more Marketable.\nBoon-iour Monsieur le Beu, what's the newes?\n  Le Beu. Faire Princesse,\nyou haue lost much good sport\n\n   Cel. Sport: of what colour?\n  Le Beu. What colour Madame? How shall I aunswer\nyou?\n  Ros. As wit and fortune will\n\n   Clo. Or as the destinies decrees\n\n   Cel. Well said, that was laid on with a trowell\n\n   Clo. Nay, if I keepe not my ranke\n\n   Ros. Thou loosest thy old smell\n\n   Le Beu. You amaze me Ladies: I would haue told\nyou of good wrastling, which you haue lost the sight of\n\n   Ros. Yet tell vs the manner of the Wrastling\n\n   Le Beu. I wil tell you the beginning: and if it please\nyour Ladiships, you may see the end, for the best is yet\nto doe, and heere where you are, they are comming to\nperforme it\n\n   Cel. Well, the beginning that is dead and buried\n\n   Le Beu. There comes an old man, and his three sons\n\n   Cel. I could match this beginning with an old tale\n\n   Le Beu. Three proper yong men, of excellent growth\nand presence\n\n   Ros. With bils on their neckes: Be it knowne vnto\nall men by these presents\n\n   Le Beu. The eldest of the three, wrastled with Charles\nthe Dukes Wrastler, which Charles in a moment threw\nhim, and broke three of his ribbes, that there is little\nhope of life in him: So he seru'd the second, and so the\nthird: yonder they lie, the poore old man their Father,\nmaking such pittiful dole ouer them, that all the beholders\ntake his part with weeping\n\n   Ros. Alas\n\n   Clo. But what is the sport Monsieur, that the Ladies\nhaue lost?\n  Le Beu. Why this that I speake of\n\n   Clo. Thus men may grow wiser euery day. It is the\nfirst time that euer I heard breaking of ribbes was sport\nfor Ladies\n\n   Cel. Or I, I promise thee\n\n   Ros. But is there any else longs to see this broken\nMusicke in his sides? Is there yet another doates vpon\nrib-breaking? Shall we see this wrastling Cosin?\n  Le Beu. You must if you stay heere, for heere is the\nplace appointed for the wrastling, and they are ready to\nperforme it\n\n   Cel. Yonder sure they are comming. Let vs now stay\nand see it.\n\nFlourish. Enter Duke, Lords, Orlando, Charles, and Attendants.\n\n  Duke. Come on, since the youth will not be intreated\nHis owne perill on his forwardnesse\n\n   Ros. Is yonder the man?\n  Le Beu. Euen he, Madam\n\n   Cel. Alas, he is too yong: yet he looks successefully\n  Du. How now daughter, and Cousin:\nAre you crept hither to see the wrastling?\n  Ros. I my Liege, so please you giue vs leaue\n\n   Du. You wil take little delight in it, I can tell you\nthere is such oddes in the man: In pitie of the challengers\nyouth, I would faine disswade him, but he will not\nbee entreated. Speake to him Ladies, see if you can\nmooue him\n\n   Cel. Call him hether good Monsieuer Le Beu\n\n   Duke. Do so: Ile not be by\n\n   Le Beu. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princesse cals\nfor you\n\n   Orl. I attend them with all respect and dutie\n\n   Ros. Young man, haue you challeng'd Charles the\nWrastler?\n  Orl. No faire Princesse: he is the generall challenger,\nI come but in as others do, to try with him the strength\nof my youth\n\n   Cel. Yong Gentleman, your spirits are too bold for\nyour yeares: you haue seene cruell proofe of this mans\nstrength, if you saw your selfe with your eies, or knew\nyour selfe with your iudgment, the feare of your aduenture\nwould counsel you to a more equall enterprise. We\npray you for your owne sake to embrace your own safetie,\nand giue ouer this attempt\n\n   Ros. Do yong Sir, your reputation shall not therefore\nbe misprised: we wil make it our suite to the Duke, that\nthe wrastling might not go forward\n\n   Orl. I beseech you, punish mee not with your harde\nthoughts, wherein I confesse me much guiltie to denie\nso faire and excellent Ladies anie thing. But let your\nfaire eies, and gentle wishes go with mee to my triall;\nwherein if I bee foil'd, there is but one sham'd that was\nneuer gracious: if kil'd, but one dead that is willing to\nbe so: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I haue none to\nlament me: the world no iniurie, for in it I haue nothing:\nonely in the world I fil vp a place, which may bee better\nsupplied, when I haue made it emptie\n\n   Ros. The little strength that I haue, I would it were\nwith you\n\n   Cel. And mine to eeke out hers\n\n   Ros. Fare you well: praie heauen I be deceiu'd in you\n\n   Cel. Your hearts desires be with you\n\n   Char. Come, where is this yong gallant, that is so\ndesirous to lie with his mother earth?\n  Orl. Readie Sir, but his will hath in it a more modest\nworking\n\n   Duk. You shall trie but one fall\n\n   Cha. No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat\nhim to a second, that haue so mightilie perswaded him\nfrom a first\n\n   Orl. You meane to mocke me after: you should not\nhaue mockt me before: but come your waies\n\n   Ros. Now Hercules, be thy speede yong man\n\n   Cel. I would I were inuisible, to catch the strong fellow\nby the legge.\n\nWrastle.\n\n  Ros. Oh excellent yong man\n\n   Cel. If I had a thunderbolt in mine eie, I can tell who\nshould downe.\n\nShout.\n\n  Duk. No more, no more\n\n   Orl. Yes I beseech your Grace, I am not yet well\nbreath'd\n\n   Duk. How do'st thou Charles?\n  Le Beu. He cannot speake my Lord\n\n   Duk. Beare him awaie:\nWhat is thy name yong man?\n  Orl. Orlando my Liege, the yongest sonne of Sir Roland\nde Boys\n\n   Duk. I would thou hadst beene son to some man else,\nThe world esteem'd thy father honourable,\nBut I did finde him still mine enemie:\nThou should'st haue better pleas'd me with this deede,\nHadst thou descended from another house:\nBut fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth,\nI would thou had'st told me of another Father.\n\nExit Duke.\n\n  Cel. Were I my Father (Coze) would I do this?\n  Orl. I am more proud to be Sir Rolands sonne,\nHis yongest sonne, and would not change that calling\nTo be adopted heire to Fredricke\n\n   Ros. My Father lou'd Sir Roland as his soule,\nAnd all the world was of my Fathers minde,\nHad I before knowne this yong man his sonne,\nI should haue giuen him teares vnto entreaties,\nEre he should thus haue ventur'd\n\n   Cel. Gentle Cosen,\nLet vs goe thanke him, and encourage him:\nMy Fathers rough and enuious disposition\nSticks me at heart: Sir, you haue well deseru'd,\nIf you doe keepe your promises in loue;\nBut iustly as you haue exceeded all promise,\nYour Mistris shall be happie\n\n   Ros. Gentleman,\nWeare this for me: one out of suites with fortune\nThat could giue more, but that her hand lacks meanes.\nShall we goe Coze?\n  Cel. I: fare you well faire Gentleman\n\n   Orl. Can I not say, I thanke you? My better parts\nAre all throwne downe, and that which here stands vp\nIs but a quintine, a meere liuelesse blocke\n\n   Ros. He cals vs back: my pride fell with my fortunes,\nIle aske him what he would: Did you call Sir?\nSir, you haue wrastled well, and ouerthrowne\nMore then your enemies\n\n   Cel. Will you goe Coze?\n  Ros. Haue with you: fare you well.\nEnter.\n\n  Orl. What passion hangs these waights vpo[n] my toong?\nI cannot speake to her, yet she vrg'd conference.\nEnter Le Beu.\n\nO poore Orlando! thou art ouerthrowne\nOr Charles, or something weaker masters thee\n\n   Le Beu. Good Sir, I do in friendship counsaile you\nTo leaue this place; Albeit you haue deseru'd\nHigh commendation, true applause, and loue;\nYet such is now the Dukes condition,\nThat he misconsters all that you haue done:\nThe Duke is humorous, what he is indeede\nMore suites you to conceiue, then I to speake of\n\n   Orl. I thanke you Sir; and pray you tell me this,\nWhich of the two was daughter of the Duke,\nThat here was at the Wrastling?\n  Le Beu. Neither his daughter, if we iudge by manners,\nBut yet indeede the taller is his daughter,\nThe other is daughter to the banish'd Duke,\nAnd here detain'd by her vsurping Vncle\nTo keepe his daughter companie, whose loues\nAre deerer then the naturall bond of Sisters:\nBut I can tell you, that of late this Duke\nHath tane displeasure 'gainst his gentle Neece,\nGrounded vpon no other argument,\nBut that the people praise her for her vertues,\nAnd pittie her, for her good Fathers sake;\nAnd on my life his malice 'gainst the Lady\nWill sodainly breake forth: Sir, fare you well,\nHereafter in a better world then this,\nI shall desire more loue and knowledge of you\n\n   Orl. I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.\nThus must I from the smoake into the smother,\nFrom tyrant Duke, vnto a tyrant Brother.\nBut heauenly Rosaline.\n\nExit\n\n\nScena Tertius.\n\nEnter Celia and Rosaline.\n\n  Cel. Why Cosen, why Rosaline: Cupid haue mercie,\nNot a word?\n  Ros. Not one to throw at a dog\n\n   Cel. No, thy words are too precious to be cast away\nvpon curs, throw some of them at me; come lame mee\nwith reasons\n\n   Ros. Then there were two Cosens laid vp, when the\none should be lam'd with reasons, and the other mad\nwithout any\n\n   Cel. But is all this for your Father?\n  Ros. No, some of it is for my childes Father: Oh\nhow full of briers is this working day world\n\n   Cel. They are but burs, Cosen, throwne vpon thee\nin holiday foolerie, if we walke not in the trodden paths\nour very petty-coates will catch them\n\n   Ros. I could shake them off my coate, these burs are\nin my heart\n\n   Cel. Hem them away\n\n   Ros. I would try if I could cry hem, and haue him\n\n   Cel. Come, come, wrastle with thy affections\n\n   Ros. O they take the part of a better wrastler then\nmy selfe\n\n   Cel. O, a good wish vpon you: you will trie in time\nin dispight of a fall: but turning these iests out of seruice,\nlet vs talke in good earnest: Is it possible on such a sodaine,\nyou should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir\nRoulands yongest sonne?\n  Ros. The Duke my Father lou'd his Father deerelie\n\n   Cel. Doth it therefore ensue that you should loue his\nSonne deerelie? By this kinde of chase, I should hate\nhim, for my father hated his father deerely; yet I hate\nnot Orlando\n\n   Ros. No faith, hate him not for my sake\n\n   Cel. Why should I not? doth he not deserue well?\nEnter Duke with Lords.\n\n  Ros. Let me loue him for that, and do you loue him\nBecause I doe. Looke, here comes the Duke\n\n   Cel. With his eies full of anger\n\n   Duk. Mistris, dispatch you with your safest haste,\nAnd get you from our Court\n\n   Ros. Me Vncle\n\n   Duk. You Cosen,\nWithin these ten daies if that thou beest found\nSo neere our publike Court as twentie miles,\nThou diest for it\n\n   Ros. I doe beseech your Grace\nLet me the knowledge of my fault beare with me:\nIf with my selfe I hold intelligence,\nOr haue acquaintance with mine owne desires,\nIf that I doe not dreame, or be not franticke,\n(As I doe trust I am not) then deere Vncle,\nNeuer so much as in a thought vnborne,\nDid I offend your highnesse\n\n   Duk. Thus doe all Traitors,\nIf their purgation did consist in words,\nThey are as innocent as grace it selfe;\nLet is suffice thee that I trust thee not\n\n   Ros. Yet your mistrust cannot make me a Traitor;\nTell me whereon the likelihoods depends?\n  Duk. Thou art thy Fathers daughter, there's enough\n\n   Ros. So was I when your highnes took his Dukdome,\nSo was I when your highnesse banisht him;\nTreason is not inherited my Lord,\nOr if we did deriue it from our friends,\nWhat's that to me, my Father was no Traitor,\nThen good my Leige, mistake me not so much,\nTo thinke my pouertie is treacherous\n\n   Cel. Deere Soueraigne heare me speake\n\n   Duk. I Celia, we staid her for your sake,\nElse had she with her Father rang'd along\n\n   Cel. I did not then intreat to haue her stay,\nIt was your pleasure, and your owne remorse,\nI was too yong that time to value her,\nBut now I know her: if she be a Traitor,\nWhy so am I: we still haue slept together,\nRose at an instant, learn'd, plaid, eate together,\nAnd wheresoere we went, like Iunos Swans,\nStill we went coupled and inseperable\n\n   Duk. She is too subtile for thee, and her smoothnes;\nHer verie silence, and her patience,\nSpeake to the people, and they pittie her:\nThou art a foole, she robs thee of thy name,\nAnd thou wilt show more bright, & seem more vertuous\nWhen she is gone: then open not thy lips\nFirme, and irreuocable is my doombe,\nWhich I haue past vpon her, she is banish'd\n\n   Cel. Pronounce that sentence then on me my Leige,\nI cannot liue out of her companie\n\n   Duk. You are a foole: you Neice prouide your selfe,\nIf you out-stay the time, vpon mine honor,\nAnd in the greatnesse of my word you die.\n\nExit Duke, &c.\n\n  Cel. O my poore Rosaline, whether wilt thou goe?\nWilt thou change Fathers? I will giue thee mine:\nI charge thee be not thou more grieu'd then I am\n\n   Ros. I haue more cause\n\n   Cel. Thou hast not Cosen,\nPrethee be cheerefull; know'st thou not the Duke\nHath banish'd me his daughter?\n  Ros. That he hath not\n\n   Cel. No, hath not? Rosaline lacks then the loue\nWhich teacheth thee that thou and I am one,\nShall we be sundred? shall we part sweete girle?\nNo, let my Father seeke another heire:\nTherefore deuise with me how we may flie\nWhether to goe, and what to beare with vs,\nAnd doe not seeke to take your change vpon you,\nTo beare your griefes your selfe, and leaue me out:\nFor by this heauen, now at our sorrowes pale;\nSay what thou canst, Ile goe along with thee\n\n   Ros. Why, whether shall we goe?\n  Cel. To seeke my Vncle in the Forrest of Arden\n\n   Ros. Alas, what danger will it be to vs,\n(Maides as we are) to trauell forth so farre?\nBeautie prouoketh theeues sooner then gold\n\n   Cel. Ile put my selfe in poore and meane attire,\nAnd with a kinde of vmber smirch my face,\nThe like doe you, so shall we passe along,\nAnd neuer stir assailants\n\n   Ros. Were it not better,\nBecause that I am more then common tall,\nThat I did suite me all points like a man,\nA gallant curtelax vpon my thigh,\nA bore-speare in my hand, and in my heart\nLye there what hidden womans feare there will,\nWeele haue a swashing and a marshall outside,\nAs manie other mannish cowards haue,\nThat doe outface it with their semblances\n\n   Cel. What shall I call thee when thou art a man?\n  Ros. Ile haue no worse a name then Ioues owne Page,\nAnd therefore looke you call me Ganimed.\nBut what will you be call'd?\n  Cel. Something that hath a reference to my state:\nNo longer Celia, but Aliena\n\n   Ros. But Cosen, what if we assaid to steale\nThe clownish Foole out of your Fathers Court:\nWould he not be a comfort to our trauaile?\n  Cel. Heele goe along ore the wide world with me,\nLeaue me alone to woe him; Let's away\nAnd get our Iewels and our wealth together,\nDeuise the fittest time, and safest way\nTo hide vs from pursuite that will be made\nAfter my flight: now goe in we content\nTo libertie, and not to banishment.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nActus Secundus. Scoena Prima.\n\nEnter Duke Senior: Amyens, and two or three Lords like\nForresters.\n\n  Duk.Sen. Now my Coe-mates, and brothers in exile:\nHath not old custome made this life more sweete\nThen that of painted pompe? Are not these woods\nMore free from perill then the enuious Court?\nHeere feele we not the penaltie of Adam,\nThe seasons difference, as the Icie phange\nAnd churlish chiding of the winters winde,\nWhich when it bites and blowes vpon my body\nEuen till I shrinke with cold, I smile, and say\nThis is no flattery: these are counsellors\nThat feelingly perswade me what I am:\nSweet are the vses of aduersitie\nWhich like the toad, ougly and venemous,\nWeares yet a precious Iewell in his head:\nAnd this our life exempt from publike haunt,\nFindes tongues in trees, bookes in the running brookes,\nSermons in stones, and good in euery thing\n\n   Amien. I would not change it, happy is your Grace\nThat can translate the stubbornnesse of fortune\nInto so quiet and so sweet a stile\n\n   Du.Sen. Come, shall we goe and kill vs venison?\nAnd yet it irkes me the poore dapled fooles\nBeing natiue Burgers of this desert City,\nShould in their owne confines with forked heads\nHaue their round hanches goard\n\n   1.Lord. Indeed my Lord\nThe melancholy Iaques grieues at that,\nAnd in that kinde sweares you doe more vsurpe\nThen doth your brother that hath banish'd you:\nTo day my Lord of Amiens, and my selfe,\nDid steale behinde him as he lay along\nVnder an oake, whose anticke roote peepes out\nVpon the brooke that brawles along this wood,\nTo the which place a poore sequestred Stag\nThat from the Hunters aime had tane a hurt,\nDid come to languish; and indeed my Lord\nThe wretched annimall heau'd forth such groanes\nThat their discharge did stretch his leatherne coat\nAlmost to bursting, and the big round teares\nCours'd one another downe his innocent nose\nIn pitteous chase: and thus the hairie foole,\nMuch marked of the melancholie Iaques,\nStood on th' extremest verge of the swift brooke,\nAugmenting it with teares\n\n   Du.Sen. But what said Iaques?\nDid he not moralize this spectacle?\n  1.Lord. O yes, into a thousand similies.\nFirst, for his weeping into the needlesse streame;\nPoore Deere quoth he, thou mak'st a testament\nAs worldlings doe, giuing thy sum of more\nTo that which had too much: then being there alone,\nLeft and abandoned of his veluet friend;\n'Tis right quoth he, thus miserie doth part\nThe Fluxe of companie: anon a carelesse Heard\nFull of the pasture, iumps along by him\nAnd neuer staies to greet him: I quoth Iaques,\nSweepe on you fat and greazie Citizens,\n'Tis iust the fashion; wherefore doe you looke\nVpon that poore and broken bankrupt there?\nThus most inuectiuely he pierceth through\nThe body of Countrie, Citie, Court,\nYea, and of this our life, swearing that we\nAre meere vsurpers, tyrants, and whats worse\nTo fright the Annimals, and to kill them vp\nIn their assign'd and natiue dwelling place\n\n   D.Sen. And did you leaue him in this contemplation?\n  2.Lord. We did my Lord, weeping and commenting\nVpon the sobbing Deere\n\n   Du.Sen. Show me the place,\nI loue to cope him in these sullen fits,\nFor then he's full of matter\n\n   1.Lor. Ile bring you to him strait.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nScena Secunda.\n\nEnter Duke, with Lords.\n\n  Duk. Can it be possible that no man saw them?\nIt cannot be, some villaines of my Court\nAre of consent and sufferance in this\n\n   1.Lo. I cannot heare of any that did see her,\nThe Ladies her attendants of her chamber\nSaw her a bed, and in the morning early,\nThey found the bed vntreasur'd of their Mistris\n\n   2.Lor. My Lord, the roynish Clown, at whom so oft,\nYour Grace was wont to laugh is also missing,\nHisperia the Princesse Gentlewoman\nConfesses that she secretly ore-heard\nYour daughter and her Cosen much commend\nThe parts and graces of the Wrastler\nThat did but lately foile the synowie Charles,\nAnd she beleeues where euer they are gone\nThat youth is surely in their companie\n\n   Duk. Send to his brother, fetch that gallant hither,\nIf he be absent, bring his Brother to me,\nIle make him finde him: do this sodainly;\nAnd let not search and inquisition quaile,\nTo bring againe these foolish runawaies.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nScena Tertia.\n\nEnter Orlando and Adam.\n\n  Orl. Who's there?\n  Ad. What my yong Master, oh my gentle master,\nOh my sweet master, O you memorie\nOf old Sir Rowland; why, what make you here?\nWhy are you vertuous? Why do people loue you?\nAnd wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant?\nWhy would you be so fond to ouercome\nThe bonnie priser of the humorous Duke?\nYour praise is come too swiftly home before you.\nKnow you not Master, to seeme kinde of men,\nTheir graces serue them but as enemies,\nNo more doe yours: your vertues gentle Master\nAre sanctified and holy traitors to you:\nOh what a world is this, when what is comely\nEnuenoms him that beares it?\nWhy, what's the matter?\n  Ad. O vnhappie youth,\nCome not within these doores: within this roofe\nThe enemie of all your graces liues\nYour brother, no, no brother, yet the sonne\n(Yet not the son, I will not call him son)\nOf him I was about to call his Father,\nHath heard your praises, and this night he meanes,\nTo burne the lodging where you vse to lye,\nAnd you within it: if he faile of that\nHe will haue other meanes to cut you off;\nI ouerheard him: and his practises:\nThis is no place, this house is but a butcherie;\nAbhorre it, feare it, doe not enter it\n\n   Ad. Why whether Adam would'st thou haue me go?\n  Ad. No matter whether, so you come not here\n\n   Orl. What, would'st thou haue me go & beg my food,\nOr with a base and boistrous Sword enforce\nA theeuish liuing on the common rode?\nThis I must do, or know not what to do:\nYet this I will not do, do how I can,\nI rather will subiect me to the malice\nOf a diuerted blood, and bloudie brother\n\n   Ad.

He saues my labor by his owne approach\n\n   Du.Sen. Why how now Monsieur, what a life is this\nThat your poore friends must woe your companie,\nWhat, you looke merrily\n\n   Iaq. A Foole, a foole: I met a foole i'th Forrest,\nA motley Foole (a miserable world:)\nAs I do liue by foode, I met a foole,\nWho laid him downe, and bask'd him in the Sun,\nAnd rail'd on Lady Fortune in good termes,\nIn good set termes, and yet a motley foole.\nGood morrow foole (quoth I:) no Sir, quoth he,\nCall me not foole, till heauen hath sent me fortune,\nAnd then he drew a diall from his poake,\nAnd looking on it, with lacke-lustre eye,\nSayes, very wisely, it is ten a clocke:\nThus we may see (quoth he) how the world wagges:\n'Tis but an houre agoe, since it was nine,\nAnd after one houre more, 'twill be eleuen,\nAnd so from houre to houre, we ripe, and ripe,\nAnd then from houre to houre, we rot, and rot,\nAnd thereby hangs a tale. When I did heare\nThe motley Foole, thus morall on the time,\nMy Lungs began to crow like Chanticleere,\nThat Fooles should be so deepe contemplatiue:\nAnd I did laugh, sans intermission\nAn houre by his diall. Oh noble foole,\nA worthy foole: Motley's the onely weare\n\n   Du.Sen. What foole is this?\n  Iaq. O worthie Foole: One that hath bin a Courtier\nAnd sayes, if Ladies be but yong, and faire,\nThey haue the gift to know it: and in his braine,\nWhich is as drie as the remainder bisket\nAfter a voyage: He hath strange places cram'd\nWith obseruation, the which he vents\nIn mangled formes. O that I were a foole,\nI am ambitious for a motley coat\n\n   Du.Sen. Thou shalt haue one\n\n   Iaq. It is my onely suite,\nProuided that you weed your better iudgements\nOf all opinion that growes ranke in them,\nThat I am wise. I must haue liberty\nWithall, as large a Charter as the winde,\nTo blow on whom I please, for so fooles haue:\nAnd they that are most gauled with my folly,\nThey most must laugh: And why sir must they so?\nThe why is plaine, as way to Parish Church:\nHee, that a Foole doth very wisely hit,\nDoth very foolishly, although he smart\nSeeme senselesse of the bob. If not,\nThe Wise-mans folly is anathomiz'd\nEuen by the squandring glances of the foole.\nInuest me in my motley: Giue me leaue\nTo speake my minde, and I will through and through\nCleanse the foule bodie of th' infected world,\nIf they will patiently receiue my medicine\n\n   Du.Sen. Fie on thee. I can tell what thou wouldst do\n\n   Iaq. What, for a Counter, would I do, but good?\n  Du.Sen. Most mischeeuous foule sin, in chiding sin:\nFor thou thy selfe hast bene a Libertine,\nAs sensuall as the brutish sting it selfe,\nAnd all th' imbossed sores, and headed euils,\nThat thou with license of free foot hast caught,\nWould'st thou disgorge into the generall world\n\n   Iaq. Why who cries out on pride,\nThat can therein taxe any priuate party:\nDoth it not flow as hugely as the Sea,\nTill that the wearie verie meanes do ebbe.\nWhat woman in the Citie do I name,\nWhen that I say the City woman beares\nThe cost of Princes on vnworthy shoulders?\nWho can come in, and say that I meane her,\nWhen such a one as shee, such is her neighbor?\nOr what is he of basest function,\nThat sayes his brauerie is not on my cost,\nThinking that I meane him, but therein suites\nHis folly to the mettle of my speech,\nThere then, how then, what then, let me see wherein\nMy tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,\nThen he hath wrong'd himselfe: if he be free,\nWhy then my taxing like a wild-goose flies\nVnclaim'd of any man. But who come here?\nEnter Orlando.\n\n  Orl. Forbeare, and eate no more\n\n   Iaq. Why I haue eate none yet\n\n   Orl. Nor shalt not, till necessity be seru'd\n\n   Iaq. Of what kinde should this Cocke come of?\n  Du.Sen. Art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distres?\nOr else a rude despiser of good manners,\nThat in ciuility thou seem'st so emptie?\n  Orl. You touch'd my veine at first, the thorny point\nOf bare distresse, hath tane from me the shew\nOf smooth ciuility: yet am I in-land bred,\nAnd know some nourture: But forbeare, I say,\nHe dies that touches any of this fruite,\nTill I, and my affaires are answered\n\n   Iaq. And you will not be answer'd with reason,\nI must dye\n\n   Du.Sen. What would you haue?\nYour gentlenesse shall force, more then your force\nMoue vs to gentlenesse\n\n   Orl. I almost die for food, and let me haue it\n\n   Du.Sen. Sit downe and feed, & welcom to our table\n  Orl. Speake you so gently? Pardon me I pray you,\nI thought that all things had bin sauage heere,\nAnd therefore put I on the countenance\nOf sterne command'ment. But what ere you are\nThat in this desert inaccessible,\nVnder the shade of melancholly boughes,\nLoose, and neglect the creeping houres of time:\nIf euer you haue look'd on better dayes:\nIf euer beene where bels haue knoll'd to Church:\nIf euer sate at any good mans feast:\nIf euer from your eye-lids wip'd a teare,\nAnd know what 'tis to pittie, and be pittied:\nLet gentlenesse my strong enforcement be,\nIn the which hope, I blush, and hide my Sword\n\n   Du.Sen. True is it, that we haue seene better dayes,\nAnd haue with holy bell bin knowld to Church,\nAnd sat at good mens feasts, and wip'd our eies\nOf drops, that sacred pity hath engendred:\nAnd therefore sit you downe in gentlenesse,\nAnd take vpon command, what helpe we haue\nThat to your wanting may be ministred\n\n   Orl. Then but forbeare your food a little while:\nWhiles (like a Doe) I go to finde my Fawne,\nAnd giue it food. There is an old poore man,\nWho after me, hath many a weary steppe\nLimpt in pure loue: till he be first suffic'd,\nOpprest with two weake euils, age, and hunger,\nI will not touch a bit\n\n   Duke Sen. Go finde him out,\nAnd we will nothing waste till you returne\n\n   Orl. I thanke ye, and be blest for your good comfort\n\n   Du.Sen. Thou seest, we are not all alone vnhappie:\nThis wide and vniuersall Theater\nPresents more wofull Pageants then the Sceane\nWherein we play in\n\n   Ia. All the world's a stage,\nAnd all the men and women, meerely Players;\nThey haue their Exits and their Entrances,\nAnd one man in his time playes many parts,\nHis Acts being seuen ages. At first the Infant,\nMewling, and puking in the Nurses armes:\nThen, the whining Schoole-boy with his Satchell\nAnd shining morning face, creeping like snaile\nVnwillingly to schoole. And then the Louer,\nSighing like Furnace, with a wofull ballad\nMade to his Mistresse eye-brow. Then, a Soldier,\nFull of strange oaths, and bearded like the Pard,\nIelous in honor, sodaine, and quicke in quarrell,\nSeeking the bubble Reputation\nEuen in the Canons mouth: And then, the Iustice\nIn faire round belly, with good Capon lin'd,\nWith eyes seuere, and beard of formall cut,\nFull of wise sawes, and moderne instances,\nAnd so he playes his part. The sixt age shifts\nInto the leane and slipper'd Pantaloone,\nWith spectacles on nose, and pouch on side,\nHis youthfull hose well sau'd, a world too wide,\nFor his shrunke shanke, and his bigge manly voice,\nTurning againe toward childish trebble pipes,\nAnd whistles in his sound. Last Scene of all,\nThat ends this strange euentfull historie,\nIs second childishnesse, and meere obliuion,\nSans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans euery thing.\nEnter Orlando with Adam.\n\n  Du.Sen.

And how like you this shepherds life Mr Touchstone?\n  Clow. Truely Shepheard, in respect of it selfe, it is a\ngood life; but in respect that it is a shepheards life, it is\nnaught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it verie well:\nbut in respect that it is priuate, it is a very vild life. Now\nin respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth mee well: but in\nrespect it is not in the Court, it is tedious. As it is a spare\nlife (looke you) it fits my humor well: but as there is no\nmore plentie in it, it goes much against my stomacke.\nHas't any Philosophie in thee shepheard?\n  Cor. No more, but that I know the more one sickens,\nthe worse at ease he is: and that hee that wants money,\nmeanes, and content, is without three good frends. That\nthe propertie of raine is to wet, and fire to burne: That\ngood pasture makes fat sheepe: and that a great cause of\nthe night, is lacke of the Sunne: That hee that hath learned\nno wit by Nature, nor Art, may complaine of good\nbreeding, or comes of a very dull kindred\n\n   Clo. Such a one is a naturall Philosopher:\nWas't euer in Court, Shepheard?\n  Cor. No truly\n\n   Clo. Then thou art damn'd\n\n   Cor. Nay, I hope\n\n   Clo. Truly thou art damn'd, like an ill roasted Egge,\nall on one side\n\n   Cor. For not being at Court? your reason\n\n   Clo. Why, if thou neuer was't at Court, thou neuer\nsaw'st good manners: if thou neuer saw'st good maners,\nthen thy manners must be wicked, and wickednes is sin,\nand sinne is damnation: Thou art in a parlous state shepheard\n\n   Cor. Not a whit Touchstone, those that are good maners\nat the Court, are as ridiculous in the Countrey, as\nthe behauiour of the Countrie is most mockeable at the\nCourt. You told me, you salute not at the Court, but\nyou kisse your hands; that courtesie would be vncleanlie\nif Courtiers were shepheards\n\n   Clo. Instance, briefly: come, instance\n\n   Cor. Why we are still handling our Ewes, and their\nFels you know are greasie\n\n   Clo. Why do not your Courtiers hands sweate? and\nis not the grease of a Mutton, as wholesome as the sweat\nof a man? Shallow, shallow: A better instance I say:\nCome\n\n   Cor. Besides, our hands are hard\n\n   Clo. Your lips wil feele them the sooner. Shallow agen:\na more sounder instance, come\n\n   Cor. And they are often tarr'd ouer, with the surgery\nof our sheepe: and would you haue vs kisse Tarre? The\nCourtiers hands are perfum'd with Ciuet\n\n   Clo. Most shallow man: Thou wormes meate in respect\nof a good peece of flesh indeed: learne of the wise\nand perpend: Ciuet is of a baser birth then Tarre, the\nverie vncleanly fluxe of a Cat. Mend the instance Shepheard\n\n   Cor. You haue too Courtly a wit, for me, Ile rest\n\n   Clo. Wilt thou rest damn'd? God helpe thee shallow\nman: God make incision in thee, thou art raw\n\n   Cor. Sir, I am a true Labourer, I earne that I eate: get\nthat I weare; owe no man hate, enuie no mans happinesse:\nglad of other mens good content with my harme:\nand the greatest of my pride, is to see my Ewes graze, &\nmy Lambes sucke\n\n   Clo. That is another simple sinne in you, to bring the\nEwes and the Rammes together, and to offer to get your\nliuing, by the copulation of Cattle, to be bawd to a Belweather,\nand to betray a shee-Lambe of a tweluemonth\nto a crooked-pated olde Cuckoldly Ramme, out of all\nreasonable match. If thou bee'st not damn'd for this, the\ndiuell himselfe will haue no shepherds, I cannot see else\nhow thou shouldst scape\n\n   Cor.

Noe:\nTonges Ile hang on euerie tree,\nthat shall ciuill sayings shoe.\nSome, how briefe the Life of man\nruns his erring pilgrimage,\nThat the stretching of a span,\nbuckles in his summe of age.\nSome of violated vowes,\ntwixt the soules of friend, and friend:\nBut vpon the fairest bowes,\nor at euerie sentence end;\nWill I Rosalinda write,\nteaching all that reade, to know\nThe quintessence of euerie sprite,\nheauen would in little show.\nTherefore heauen Nature charg'd,\nthat one bodie should be fill'd\nWith all Graces wide enlarg'd,\nnature presently distill'd\nHelens cheeke, but not his heart,\nCleopatra's Maiestie:\nAttalanta's better part,\nsad Lucrecia's Modestie.\nThus Rosalinde of manie parts,\nby Heauenly Synode was deuis'd,\nOf manie faces, eyes, and hearts,\nto haue the touches deerest pris'd.\nHeauen would that shee these gifts should haue,\nand I to liue and die her slaue\n\n   Ros. O most gentle Iupiter, what tedious homilie of\nLoue haue you wearied your parishioners withall, and\nneuer cri'de, haue patience good people\n\n   Cel. How now backe friends: Shepheard, go off a little:\ngo with him sirrah\n\n   Clo. Come Shepheard, let vs make an honorable retreit,\nthough not with bagge and baggage, yet with\nscrip and scrippage.\nEnter.\n\n  Cel. Didst thou heare these verses?\n  Ros. O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some\nof them had in them more feete then the Verses would\nbeare\n\n   Cel. That's no matter: the feet might beare y verses\n\n   Ros. I, but the feet were lame, and could not beare\nthemselues without the verse, and therefore stood lamely\nin the verse\n\n   Cel. But didst thou heare without wondering, how\nthy name should be hang'd and carued vpon these trees?\n  Ros. I was seuen of the nine daies out of the wonder,\nbefore you came: for looke heere what I found on a\nPalme tree; I was neuer so berim'd since Pythagoras time\nthat I was an Irish Rat, which I can hardly remember\n\n   Cel. Tro you, who hath done this?\n  Ros. Is it a man?\n  Cel. And a chaine that you once wore about his neck:\nchange you colour?\n  Ros. I pre'thee who?\n  Cel. O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to\nmeete; but Mountaines may bee remoou'd with Earthquakes,\nand so encounter\n\n   Ros. Nay, but who is it?\n  Cel. Is it possible?\n  Ros. Nay, I pre'thee now, with most petitionary vehemence,\ntell me who it is\n\n   Cel. O wonderfull, wonderfull, and most wonderfull\nwonderfull, and yet againe wonderful, and after that out\nof all hooping\n\n   Ros. Good my complection, dost thou think though\nI am caparison'd like a man, I haue a doublet and hose in\nmy disposition? One inch of delay more, is a South-sea\nof discouerie. I pre'thee tell me, who is it quickely, and\nspeake apace: I would thou couldst stammer, that thou\nmight'st powre this conceal'd man out of thy mouth, as\nWine comes out of a narrow-mouth'd bottle: either too\nmuch at once, or none at all. I pre'thee take the Corke\nout of thy mouth, that I may drinke thy tydings\n\n   Cel. So you may put a man in your belly\n\n   Ros. Is he of Gods making? What manner of man?\nIs his head worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard?\n  Cel. Nay, he hath but a little beard\n\n   Ros. Why God will send more, if the man will bee\nthankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou\ndelay me not the knowledge of his chin\n\n   Cel. It is yong Orlando, that tript vp the Wrastlers\nheeles, and your heart, both in an instant\n\n   Ros. Nay, but the diuell take mocking: speake sadde\nbrow, and true maid\n\n   Cel. I'faith (Coz) tis he\n\n   Ros. Orlando?\n  Cel. Orlando\n\n   Ros. Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet &\nhose? What did he when thou saw'st him? What sayde\nhe? How look'd he? Wherein went he? What makes hee\nheere? Did he aske for me? Where remaines he? How\nparted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him againe?\nAnswer me in one word\n\n   Cel. You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first:\n'tis a Word too great for any mouth of this Ages size, to\nsay I and no, to these particulars, is more then to answer\nin a Catechisme\n\n   Ros. But doth he know that I am in this Forrest, and\nin mans apparrell? Looks he as freshly, as he did the day\nhe Wrastled?\n  Cel. It is as easie to count Atomies as to resolue the\npropositions of a Louer: but take a taste of my finding\nhim, and rellish it with good obseruance. I found him\nvnder a tree like a drop'd Acorne\n\n   Ros. It may wel be cal'd Ioues tree, when it droppes\nforth fruite\n\n   Cel. Giue me audience, good Madam\n\n   Ros. Proceed\n\n   Cel. There lay hee stretch'd along like a Wounded\nknight\n\n   Ros. Though it be pittie to see such a sight, it well\nbecomes the ground\n\n   Cel. Cry holla, to the tongue, I prethee: it curuettes\nvnseasonably. He was furnish'd like a Hunter\n\n   Ros. O ominous, he comes to kill my Hart\n\n   Cel. I would sing my song without a burthen, thou\nbring'st me out of tune\n\n   Ros. Do you not know I am a woman, when I thinke,\nI must speake: sweet, say on.\nEnter Orlando & Iaques.\n\n  Cel. You bring me out. Soft, comes he not heere?\n  Ros. 'Tis he, slinke by, and note him\n\n   Iaq. I thanke you for your company, but good faith\nI had as liefe haue beene my selfe alone\n\n   Orl. And so had I: but yet for fashion sake\nI thanke you too, for your societie\n\n   Iaq. God buy you, let's meet as little as we can\n\n   Orl. I do desire we may be better strangers\n\n   Iaq. I pray you marre no more trees with Writing\nLoue-songs in their barkes\n\n   Orl. I pray you marre no moe of my verses with reading\nthem ill-fauouredly\n\n   Iaq. Rosalinde is your loues name?\n  Orl. Yes, Iust\n\n   Iaq. I do not like her name\n\n   Orl. There was no thought of pleasing you when she\nwas christen'd\n\n   Iaq. What stature is she of?\n  Orl. Iust as high as my heart\n\n   Iaq. You are ful of prety answers: haue you not bin acquainted\nwith goldsmiths wiues, & cond the[m] out of rings\n  Orl. Not so: but I answer you right painted cloath,\nfrom whence you haue studied your questions\n\n   Iaq. You haue a nimble wit; I thinke 'twas made of\nAttalanta's heeles. Will you sitte downe with me, and\nwee two, will raile against our Mistris the world, and all\nour miserie\n\n   Orl. I wil chide no breather in the world but my selfe\nagainst whom I know most faults\n\n   Iaq. The worst fault you haue, is to be in loue\n\n   Orl. 'Tis a fault I will not change, for your best vertue:\nI am wearie of you\n\n   Iaq. By my troth, I was seeking for a Foole, when I\nfound you\n\n   Orl. He is drown'd in the brooke, looke but in, and\nyou shall see him\n\n   Iaq. There I shal see mine owne figure\n\n   Orl. Which I take to be either a foole, or a Cipher\n\n   Iaq. Ile tarrie no longer with you, farewell good signior\nLoue\n\n   Orl. I am glad of your departure: Adieu good Monsieur\nMelancholly\n\n   Ros. I wil speake to him like a sawcie Lacky, and vnder\nthat habit play the knaue with him, do you hear Forrester\n\n   Orl. Verie wel, what would you?\n  Ros. I pray you, what i'st a clocke?\n  Orl. You should aske me what time o' day: there's no\nclocke in the Forrest\n\n   Ros. Then there is no true Louer in the Forrest, else\nsighing euerie minute, and groaning euerie houre wold\ndetect the lazie foot of time, as wel as a clocke\n\n   Orl. And why not the swift foote of time? Had not\nthat bin as proper?\n  Ros. By no meanes sir; Time trauels in diuers paces,\nwith diuers persons: Ile tel you who Time ambles withall,\nwho Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal,\nand who he stands stil withall\n\n   Orl. I prethee, who doth he trot withal?\n  Ros. Marry he trots hard with a yong maid, between\nthe contract of her marriage, and the day it is solemnizd:\nif the interim be but a sennight, Times pace is so hard,\nthat it seemes the length of seuen yeare\n\n   Orl. Who ambles Time withal?\n  Ros. With a Priest that lacks Latine, and a rich man\nthat hath not the Gowt: for the one sleepes easily because\nhe cannot study, and the other liues merrily, because\nhe feeles no paine: the one lacking the burthen of\nleane and wasteful Learning; the other knowing no burthen\nof heauie tedious penurie. These Time ambles\nwithal\n\n   Orl. Who doth he gallop withal?\n  Ros. With a theefe to the gallowes: for though hee\ngo as softly as foot can fall, he thinkes himselfe too soon\nthere\n\n   Orl. Who staies it stil withal?\n  Ros. With Lawiers in the vacation: for they sleepe\nbetweene Terme and Terme, and then they perceiue not\nhow time moues\n\n   Orl. Where dwel you prettie youth?\n  Ros. With this Shepheardesse my sister: heere in the\nskirts of the Forrest, like fringe vpon a petticoat\n\n   Orl. Are you natiue of this place?\n  Ros. As the Conie that you see dwell where shee is\nkindled\n\n   Orl. Your accent is something finer, then you could\npurchase in so remoued a dwelling\n\n   Ros. I haue bin told so of many: but indeed, an olde\nreligious Vnckle of mine taught me to speake, who was\nin his youth an inland man, one that knew Courtship too\nwell: for there he fel in loue. I haue heard him read many\nLectors against it, and I thanke God, I am not a Woman\nto be touch'd with so many giddie offences as hee\nhath generally tax'd their whole sex withal\n\n   Orl. Can you remember any of the principall euils,\nthat he laid to the charge of women?\n  Ros. There were none principal, they were all like\none another, as halfepence are, euerie one fault seeming\nmonstrous, til his fellow-fault came to match it\n\n   Orl. I prethee recount some of them\n\n   Ros. No: I wil not cast away my physick, but on those\nthat are sicke. There is a man haunts the Forrest, that abuses\nour yong plants with caruing Rosalinde on their\nbarkes; hangs Oades vpon Hauthornes, and Elegies on\nbrambles; all (forsooth) defying the name of Rosalinde.\nIf I could meet that Fancie-monger, I would giue him\nsome good counsel, for he seemes to haue the Quotidian\nof Loue vpon him\n\n   Orl. I am he that is so Loue-shak'd, I pray you tel\nme your remedie\n\n   Ros. There is none of my Vnckles markes vpon you:\nhe taught me how to know a man in loue: in which cage\nof rushes, I am sure you art not prisoner\n\n   Orl. What were his markes?\n  Ros. A leane cheeke, which you haue not: a blew eie\nand sunken, which you haue not: an vnquestionable spirit,\nwhich you haue not: a beard neglected, which you\nhaue not: (but I pardon you for that, for simply your hauing\nin beard, is a yonger brothers reuennew) then your\nhose should be vngarter'd, your bonnet vnbanded, your\nsleeue vnbutton'd, your shoo vnti'de, and euerie thing\nabout you, demonstrating a carelesse desolation: but you\nare no such man; you are rather point deuice in your\naccoustrements,\nas louing your selfe, then seeming the Louer\nof any other\n\n   Orl. Faire youth, I would I could make thee beleeue I Loue\n\n   Ros. Me beleeue it? You may assoone make her that\nyou Loue beleeue it, which I warrant she is apter to do,\nthen to confesse she do's: that is one of the points, in the\nwhich women stil giue the lie to their consciences. But\nin good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the\nTrees, wherein Rosalind is so admired?\n  Orl. I sweare to thee youth, by the white hand of\nRosalind, I am that he, that vnfortunate he\n\n   Ros. But are you so much in loue, as your rimes speak?\n  Orl. Neither rime nor reason can expresse how much\n\n   Ros. Loue is meerely a madnesse, and I tel you, deserues\nas wel a darke house, and a whip, as madmen do:\nand the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured, is\nthat the Lunacie is so ordinarie, that the whippers are in\nloue too: yet I professe curing it by counsel\n\n   Orl. Did you euer cure any so?\n  Ros. Yes one, and in this manner. Hee was to imagine\nme his Loue, his Mistris: and I set him euerie day\nto woe me. At which time would I, being but a moonish\nyouth, greeue, be effeminate, changeable, longing, and\nliking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, ful\nof teares, full of smiles; for euerie passion something, and\nfor no passion truly any thing, as boyes and women are\nfor the most part, cattle of this colour: would now like\nhim, now loath him: then entertaine him, then forswear\nhim: now weepe for him, then spit at him; that I draue\nmy Sutor from his mad humor of loue, to a liuing humor\nof madnes, w was to forsweare the ful stream of y world,\nand to liue in a nooke meerly Monastick: and thus I cur'd\nhim, and this way wil I take vpon mee to wash your Liuer\nas cleane as a sound sheepes heart, that there shal not\nbe one spot of Loue in't\n\n   Orl. I would not be cured, youth\n\n   Ros. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind,\nand come euerie day to my Coat, and woe me\n\n   Orlan. Now by the faith of my loue, I will; Tel me\nwhere it is\n\n   Ros. Go with me to it, and Ile shew it you: and by\nthe way, you shal tell me, where in the Forrest you liue:\nWil you go?\n  Orl. With all my heart, good youth\n\n   Ros. Nay, you must call mee Rosalind: Come sister,\nwill you go?\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nScoena Tertia.\n\nEnter Clowne, Audrey, & Iaques.\n\n  Clo. Come apace good Audrey, I wil fetch vp your\nGoates, Audrey: and how Audrey am I the man yet?\nDoth my simple feature content you?\n  Aud. Your features, Lord warrant vs: what features?\n  Clo. I am heere with thee, and thy Goats, as the most\ncapricious Poet honest Ouid was among the Gothes\n\n   Iaq. O knowledge ill inhabited, worse then Ioue in\na thatch'd house\n\n   Clo. When a mans verses cannot be vnderstood, nor\na mans good wit seconded with the forward childe, vnderstanding:\nit strikes a man more dead then a great reckoning\nin a little roome: truly, I would the Gods hadde\nmade thee poeticall\n\n   Aud. I do not know what Poetical is: is it honest in\ndeed and word: is it a true thing?\n  Clo. No trulie: for the truest poetrie is the most faining,\nand Louers are giuen to Poetrie: and what they\nsweare in Poetrie, may be said as Louers, they do feigne\n\n   Aud. Do you wish then that the Gods had made me\nPoeticall?\n  Clow. I do truly: for thou swear'st to me thou art honest:\nNow if thou wert a Poet, I might haue some hope\nthou didst feigne\n\n   Aud. Would you not haue me honest?\n  Clo. No truly, vnlesse thou wert hard fauour'd: for\nhonestie coupled to beautie, is to haue Honie a sawce to\nSugar\n\n   Iaq. A materiall foole\n\n   Aud. Well, I am not faire, and therefore I pray the\nGods make me honest\n\n   Clo. Truly, and to cast away honestie vppon a foule\nslut, were to put good meate into an vncleane dish\n\n   Aud. I am not a slut, though I thanke the Goddes I\nam foule\n\n   Clo. Well, praised be the Gods, for thy foulnesse; sluttishnesse\nmay come heereafter. But be it, as it may bee,\nI wil marrie thee: and to that end, I haue bin with Sir\nOliuer Mar-text, the Vicar of the next village, who hath\npromis'd to meete me in this place of the Forrest, and to\ncouple vs\n\n   Iaq. I would faine see this meeting\n\n   Aud. Wel, the Gods giue vs ioy\n\n   Clo. Amen. A man may if he were of a fearful heart,\nstagger in this attempt: for heere wee haue no Temple\nbut the wood, no assembly but horne-beasts. But what\nthough? Courage. As hornes are odious, they are necessarie.\nIt is said, many a man knowes no end of his goods;\nright: Many a man has good Hornes, and knows no end\nof them. Well, that is the dowrie of his wife, 'tis none\nof his owne getting; hornes, euen so poore men alone:\nNo, no, the noblest Deere hath them as huge as the Rascall:\nIs the single man therefore blessed? No, as a wall'd\nTowne is more worthier then a village, so is the forehead\nof a married man, more honourable then the bare\nbrow of a Batcheller: and by how much defence is better\nthen no skill, by so much is a horne more precious\nthen to want.\nEnter Sir Oliuer Mar-text.\n\nHeere comes Sir Oliuer: Sir Oliuer Mar-text you are\nwel met. Will you dispatch vs heere vnder this tree, or\nshal we go with you to your Chappell?\n  Ol. Is there none heere to giue the woman?\n  Clo. I wil not take her on guift of any man\n\n   Ol. Truly she must be giuen, or the marriage is not\nlawfull\n\n   Iaq. Proceed, proceede: Ile giue her\n\n   Clo. Good euen good Mr what ye cal't: how do you\nSir, you are verie well met: goddild you for your last\ncompanie, I am verie glad to see you, euen a toy in hand\nheere Sir: Nay, pray be couer'd\n\n   Iaq. Wil you be married, Motley?\n  Clo. As the Oxe hath his bow sir, the horse his curb,\nand the Falcon her bels, so man hath his desires, and as\nPigeons bill, so wedlocke would be nibling\n\n   Iaq. And wil you (being a man of your breeding) be\nmarried vnder a bush like a begger? Get you to church,\nand haue a good Priest that can tel you what marriage is,\nthis fellow wil but ioyne you together, as they ioyne\nWainscot, then one of you wil proue a shrunke pannell,\nand like greene timber, warpe, warpe\n\n   Clo. I am not in the minde, but I were better to bee\nmarried of him then of another, for he is not like to marrie\nme wel: and not being wel married, it wil be a good\nexcuse for me heereafter, to leaue my wife\n\n   Iaq. Goe thou with mee,\nAnd let me counsel thee\n\n   Ol. Come sweete Audrey,\nWe must be married, or we must liue in baudrey:\nFarewel good Mr Oliuer: Not O sweet Oliuer, O braue\nOliuer leaue me not behind thee: But winde away, bee\ngone I say, I wil not to wedding with thee\n\n   Ol. 'Tis no matter; Ne're a fantastical knaue of them\nall shal flout me out of my calling.\n\nExeunt.\n\nScoena Quarta.\n\nEnter Rosalind & Celia.\n\n  Ros. Neuer talke to me, I wil weepe\n\n   Cel. Do I prethee, but yet haue the grace to consider,\nthat teares do not become a man\n\n   Ros. But haue I not cause to weepe?\n  Cel. As good cause as one would desire,\nTherefore weepe\n\n   Ros. His very haire\nIs of the dissembling colour\n\n   Cel. Something browner then Iudasses:\nMarrie his kisses are Iudasses owne children\n\n   Ros. I'faith his haire is of a good colour\n\n   Cel. An excellent colour:\nYour Chessenut was euer the onely colour:\n  Ros. And his kissing is as ful of sanctitie,\nAs the touch of holy bread\n\n   Cel. Hee hath bought a paire of cast lips of Diana: a\nNun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiouslie,\nthe very yce of chastity is in them\n\n   Rosa. But why did hee sweare hee would come this\nmorning, and comes not?\n  Cel. Nay certainly there is no truth in him\n\n   Ros. Doe you thinke so?\n  Cel. Yes, I thinke he is not a picke purse, nor a horse-stealer,\nbut for his verity in loue, I doe thinke him as\nconcaue as a couered goblet, or a Worme-eaten nut\n\n   Ros. Not true in loue?\n  Cel. Yes, when he is in, but I thinke he is not in\n\n   Ros. You haue heard him sweare downright he was\n\n   Cel. Was, is not is: besides, the oath of Louer is no\nstronger then the word of a Tapster, they are both the\nconfirmer of false reckonings, he attends here in the forrest\non the Duke your father\n\n   Ros. I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question\nwith him: he askt me of what parentage I was; I\ntold him of as good as he, so he laugh'd and let mee goe.\nBut what talke wee of Fathers, when there is such a man\nas Orlando?\n  Cel. O that's a braue man, hee writes braue verses,\nspeakes braue words, sweares braue oathes, and breakes\nthem brauely, quite trauers athwart the heart of his louer,\nas a puisny Tilter, y spurs his horse but on one side,\nbreakes his staffe like a noble goose; but all's braue that\nyouth mounts, and folly guides: who comes heere?\nEnter Corin.\n\n  Corin. Mistresse and Master, you haue oft enquired\nAfter the Shepheard that complain'd of loue,\nWho you saw sitting by me on the Turph,\nPraising the proud disdainfull Shepherdesse\nThat was his Mistresse\n\n   Cel. Well: and what of him?\n  Cor. If you will see a pageant truely plaid\nBetweene the pale complexion of true Loue,\nAnd the red glowe of scorne and prowd disdaine,\nGoe hence a little, and I shall conduct you\nIf you will marke it\n\n   Ros. O come, let vs remoue,\nThe sight of Louers feedeth those in loue:\nBring vs to this sight, and you shall say\nIle proue a busie actor in their play.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nScena Quinta.\n\n\nEnter Siluius and Phebe.\n\n  Sil. Sweet Phebe doe not scorne me, do not Phebe\nSay that you loue me not, but say not so\nIn bitternesse; the common executioner\nWhose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard\nFalls not the axe vpon the humbled neck,\nBut first begs pardon: will you sterner be\nThen he that dies and liues by bloody drops?\nEnter Rosalind, Celia, and Corin.\n\n  Phe. I would not be thy executioner,\nI flye thee, for I would not iniure thee:\nThou tellst me there is murder in mine eye,\n'Tis pretty sure, and very probable,\nThat eyes that are the frailst, and softest things,\nWho shut their coward gates on atomyes,\nShould be called tyrants, butchers, murtherers.\nNow I doe frowne on thee with all my heart,\nAnd if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:\nNow counterfeit to swound, why now fall downe,\nOr if thou canst not, oh for shame, for shame,\nLye not, to say mine eyes are murtherers:\nNow shew the wound mine eye hath made in thee,\nScratch thee but with a pin, and there remaines\nSome scarre of it: Leane vpon a rush\nThe Cicatrice and capable impressure\nThy palme some moment keepes: but now mine eyes\nWhich I haue darted at thee, hurt thee not,\nNor I am sure there is no force in eyes\nThat can doe hurt\n\n   Sil. O deere Phebe,\nIf euer (as that euer may be neere)\nYou meet in some fresh cheeke the power of fancie,\nThen shall you know the wounds inuisible\nThat Loues keene arrows make\n\n   Phe. But till that time\nCome not thou neere me: and when that time comes,\nAfflict me with thy mockes, pitty me not,\nAs till that time I shall not pitty thee\n\n   Ros. And why I pray you? who might be your mother\nThat you insult, exult, and all at once\nOuer the wretched? what though you haue no beauty\nAs by my faith, I see no more in you\nThen without Candle may goe darke to bed:\nMust you be therefore prowd and pittilesse?\nWhy what meanes this? why do you looke on me?\nI see no more in you then in the ordinary\nOf Natures sale-worke? 'ods my little life,\nI thinke she meanes to tangle my eies too:\nNo faith proud Mistresse, hope not after it,\n'Tis not your inkie browes, your blacke silke haire,\nYour bugle eye-balls, nor your cheeke of creame\nThat can entame my spirits to your worship:\nYou foolish Shepheard, wherefore do you follow her\nLike foggy South, puffing with winde and raine,\nYou are a thousand times a properer man\nThen she a woman. 'Tis such fooles as you\nThat makes the world full of ill-fauourd children:\n'Tis not her glasse, but you that flatters her,\nAnd out of you she sees her selfe more proper\nThen any of her lineaments can show her:\nBut Mistris, know your selfe, downe on your knees\nAnd thanke heauen, fasting, for a good mans loue;\nFor I must tell you friendly in your eare,\nSell when you can, you are not for all markets:\nCry the man mercy, loue him, take his offer,\nFoule is most foule, being foule to be a scoffer.\nSo take her to thee Shepheard, fareyouwell\n\n   Phe. Sweet youth, I pray you chide a yere together,\nI had rather here you chide, then this man wooe\n\n   Ros. Hees falne in loue with your foulnesse, & shee'll\nFall in loue with my anger. If it be so, as fast\nAs she answeres thee with frowning lookes, ile sauce\nHer with bitter words: why looke you so vpon me?\n  Phe. For no ill will I beare you\n\n   Ros. I pray you do not fall in loue with mee,\nFor I am falser then vowes made in wine:\nBesides, I like you not: if you will know my house,\n'Tis at the tufft of Oliues, here hard by:\nWill you goe Sister? Shepheard ply her hard:\nCome Sister: Shepheardesse, looke on him better\nAnd be not proud, though all the world could see,\nNone could be so abus'd in sight as hee.\nCome, to our flocke,\nEnter.\n\n  Phe. Dead Shepheard, now I find thy saw of might,\nWho euer lov'd, that lou'd not at first sight?\n  Sil. Sweet Phebe\n\n   Phe. Hah: what saist thou Siluius?\n  Sil. Sweet Phebe pitty me\n\n   Phe. Why I am sorry for thee gentle Siluius\n\n   Sil. Where euer sorrow is, reliefe would be:\nIf you doe sorrow at my griefe in loue,\nBy giuing loue your sorrow, and my griefe\nWere both extermin'd\n\n   Phe. Thou hast my loue, is not that neighbourly?\n  Sil. I would haue you\n\n   Phe. Why that were couetousnesse:\nSiluius; the time was, that I hated thee;\nAnd yet it is not, that I beare thee loue,\nBut since that thou canst talke of loue so well,\nThy company, which erst was irkesome to me\nI will endure; and Ile employ thee too:\nBut doe not looke for further recompence\nThen thine owne gladnesse, that thou art employd\n\n   Sil. So holy, and so perfect is my loue,\nAnd I in such a pouerty of grace,\nThat I shall thinke it a most plenteous crop\nTo gleane the broken eares after the man\nThat the maine haruest reapes: loose now and then\nA scattred smile, and that Ile liue vpon\n\n   Phe. Knowst thou the youth that spoke to mee yerewhile?\n  Sil. Not very well, but I haue met him oft,\nAnd he hath bought the Cottage and the bounds\nThat the old Carlot once was Master of\n\n   Phe. Thinke not I loue him, though I ask for him,\n'Tis but a peeuish boy, yet he talkes well,\nBut what care I for words? yet words do well\nWhen he that speakes them pleases those that heare:\nIt is a pretty youth, not very prettie,\nBut sure hee's proud, and yet his pride becomes him;\nHee'll make a proper man: the best thing in him\nIs his complexion: and faster then his tongue\nDid make offence, his eye did heale it vp:\nHe is not very tall, yet for his yeeres hee's tall:\nHis leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well:\nThere was a pretty rednesse in his lip,\nA little riper, and more lustie red\nThen that mixt in his cheeke: 'twas iust the difference\nBetwixt the constant red, and mingled Damaske.\nThere be some women Siluius, had they markt him\nIn parcells as I did, would haue gone neere\nTo fall in loue with him: but for my part\nI loue him not, nor hate him not: and yet\nHaue more cause to hate him then to loue him,\nFor what had he to doe to chide at me?\nHe said mine eyes were black, and my haire blacke,\nAnd now I am remembred, scorn'd at me:\nI maruell why I answer'd not againe,\nBut that's all one: omittance is no quittance:\nIle write to him a very tanting Letter,\nAnd thou shalt beare it, wilt thou Siluius?\n  Sil. Phebe, with all my heart\n\n   Phe. Ile write it strait:\nThe matter's in my head, and in my heart,\nI will be bitter with him, and passing short;\nGoe with me Siluius.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nActus Quartus. Scena Prima.\n\nEnter Rosalind, and Celia, and Iaques.\n\n  Iaq. I prethee, pretty youth, let me better acquainted\nwith thee\n\n   Ros They say you are a melancholly fellow\n\n   Iaq. I am so: I doe loue it better then laughing\n\n   Ros. Those that are in extremity of either, are abhominable\nfellowes, and betray themselues to euery moderne\ncensure, worse then drunkards\n\n   Iaq. Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing\n\n   Ros. Why then 'tis good to be a poste\n\n   Iaq. I haue neither the Schollers melancholy, which\nis emulation: nor the Musitians, which is fantasticall;\nnor the Courtiers, which is proud: nor the Souldiers,\nwhich is ambitious: nor the Lawiers, which is politick:\nnor the Ladies, which is nice: nor the Louers, which\nis all these: but it is a melancholy of mine owne, compounded\nof many simples, extracted from many obiects,\nand indeed the sundrie contemplation of my trauells, in\nwhich by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous\nsadnesse\n\n   Ros. A Traueller: by my faith you haue great reason\nto be sad: I feare you haue sold your owne Lands,\nto see other mens; then to haue seene much, and to haue\nnothing, is to haue rich eyes and poore hands\n\n   Iaq. Yes, I haue gain'd my experience.\nEnter Orlando.\n\n  Ros. And your experience makes you sad: I had rather\nhaue a foole to make me merrie, then experience to\nmake me sad, and to trauaile for it too\n\n   Orl. Good day, and happinesse, deere Rosalind\n\n   Iaq. Nay then God buy you, and you talke in blanke\nverse\n\n   Ros. Farewell Mounsieur Trauellor: looke you\nlispe, and weare strange suites; disable all the benefits\nof your owne Countrie: be out of loue with your\nnatiuitie, and almost chide God for making you that\ncountenance you are; or I will scarce thinke you haue\nswam in a Gundello. Why how now Orlando, where\nhaue you bin all this while? you a louer? and you\nserue me such another tricke, neuer come in my sight\nmore\n\n   Orl. My faire Rosalind, I come within an houre of my\npromise\n\n   Ros. Breake an houres promise in loue? hee that\nwill diuide a minute into a thousand parts, and breake\nbut a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs\nof loue, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapt\nhim oth' shoulder, but Ile warrant him heart hole\n\n   Orl. Pardon me deere Rosalind\n\n   Ros. Nay, and you be so tardie, come no more in my\nsight, I had as liefe be woo'd of a Snaile\n\n   Orl. Of a Snaile?\n  Ros. I, of a Snaile: for though he comes slowly, hee\ncarries his house on his head; a better ioyncture I thinke\nthen you make a woman: besides, he brings his destinie\nwith him\n\n   Orl. What's that?\n  Ros. Why hornes: w such as you are faine to be beholding\nto your wiues for: but he comes armed in his\nfortune, and preuents the slander of his wife\n\n   Orl. Vertue is no horne-maker: and my Rosalind is\nvertuous\n\n   Ros. And I am your Rosalind\n\n   Cel. It pleases him to call you so: but he hath a Rosalind\nof a better leere then you\n\n   Ros. Come, wooe me, wooe mee: for now I am in a\nholy-day humor, and like enough to consent: What\nwould you say to me now, and I were your verie, verie\nRosalind?\n  Orl. I would kisse before I spoke\n\n   Ros. Nay, you were better speake first, and when you\nwere grauel'd, for lacke of matter, you might take occasion\nto kisse: verie good Orators when they are out,\nthey will spit, and for louers, lacking (God warne vs)\nmatter, the cleanliest shift is to kisse\n\n   Orl. How if the kisse be denide?\n  Ros. Then she puts you to entreatie, and there begins\nnew matter\n\n   Orl. Who could be out, being before his beloued\nMistris?\n  Ros. Marrie that should you if I were your Mistris,\nor I should thinke my honestie ranker then my wit\n\n   Orl. What, of my suite?\n  Ros. Not out of your apparrell, and yet out of your\nsuite:\nAm not I your Rosalind?\n  Orl. I take some ioy to say you are, because I would\nbe talking of her\n\n   Ros. Well, in her person, I say I will not haue you\n\n   Orl. Then in mine owne person, I die\n\n   Ros. No faith, die by Attorney: the poore world is\nalmost six thousand yeeres old, and in all this time there\nwas not anie man died in his owne person (videlicet) in\na loue cause: Troilous had his braines dash'd out with a\nGrecian club, yet he did what hee could to die before,\nand he is one of the patternes of loue. Leander, he would\nhaue liu'd manie a faire yeere though Hero had turn'd\nNun; if it had not bin for a hot Midsomer-night, for\n(good youth) he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont,\nand being taken with the crampe, was droun'd,\nand the foolish Chronoclers of that age, found it was\nHero of Cestos. But these are all lies, men haue died\nfrom time to time, and wormes haue eaten them, but not\nfor loue\n\n   Orl. I would not haue my right Rosalind of this mind,\nfor I protest her frowne might kill me\n\n   Ros. By this hand, it will not kill a flie: but come,\nnow I will be your Rosalind in a more comming-on disposition:\nand aske me what you will, I will grant it\n\n   Orl. Then loue me Rosalind\n\n   Ros. Yes faith will I, fridaies and saterdaies, and all\n\n   Orl. And wilt thou haue me?\n  Ros. I, and twentie such\n\n   Orl. What saiest thou?\n  Ros. Are you not good?\n  Orl. I hope so\n\n   Rosalind. Why then, can one desire too much of a\ngood thing: Come sister, you shall be the Priest, and\nmarrie vs: giue me your hand Orlando: What doe you\nsay sister?\n  Orl. Pray thee marrie vs\n\n   Cel. I cannot say the words\n\n   Ros. You must begin, will you Orlando\n\n   Cel. Goe too: wil you Orlando, haue to wife this Rosalind?\n  Orl. I will\n\n   Ros. I, but when?\n  Orl. Why now, as fast as she can marrie vs\n\n   Ros. Then you must say, I take thee Rosalind for\nwife\n\n   Orl. I take thee Rosalind for wife\n\n   Ros. I might aske you for your Commission,\nBut I doe take thee Orlando for my husband: there's a\ngirle goes before the Priest, and certainely a Womans\nthought runs before her actions\n\n   Orl. So do all thoughts, they are wing'd\n\n   Ros. Now tell me how long you would haue her, after\nyou haue possest her?\n  Orl. For euer, and a day\n\n   Ros. Say a day, without the euer: no, no Orlando, men\nare Aprill when they woe, December when they wed:\nMaides are May when they are maides, but the sky changes\nwhen they are wiues: I will bee more iealous of\nthee, then a Barbary cocke-pidgeon ouer his hen, more\nclamorous then a Parrat against raine, more new-fangled\nthen an ape, more giddy in my desires, then a monkey:\nI will weepe for nothing, like Diana in the Fountaine,\n& I wil do that when you are dispos'd to be merry:\nI will laugh like a Hyen, and that when thou art inclin'd\nto sleepe\n\n   Orl. But will my Rosalind doe so?\n  Ros. By my life, she will doe as I doe\n\n   Orl. O but she is wise\n\n   Ros. Or else shee could not haue the wit to doe this:\nthe wiser, the waywarder: make the doores vpon a womans\nwit, and it will out at the casement: shut that, and\n'twill out at the key-hole: stop that, 'twill flie with the\nsmoake out at the chimney\n\n   Orl. A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might\nsay, wit whether wil't?\n  Ros. Nay, you might keepe that checke for it, till you\nmet your wiues wit going to your neighbours bed\n\n   Orl. And what wit could wit haue, to excuse that?\n  Rosa. Marry to say, she came to seeke you there: you\nshall neuer take her without her answer, vnlesse you take\nher without her tongue: o that woman that cannot\nmake her fault her husbands occasion, let her neuer nurse\nher childe her selfe, for she will breed it like a foole\n\n   Orl. For these two houres Rosalinde, I wil leaue thee\n\n   Ros. Alas, deere loue, I cannot lacke thee two houres\n\n   Orl. I must attend the Duke at dinner, by two a clock\nI will be with thee againe\n\n   Ros. I, goe your waies, goe your waies: I knew what\nyou would proue, my friends told mee as much, and I\nthought no lesse: that flattering tongue of yours wonne\nme: 'tis but one cast away, and so come death: two o'\nclocke is your howre\n\n   Orl. I, sweet Rosalind\n\n   Ros. By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God\nmend mee, and by all pretty oathes that are not dangerous,\nif you breake one iot of your promise, or come one\nminute behinde your houre, I will thinke you the most\npatheticall breake-promise, and the most hollow louer,\nand the most vnworthy of her you call Rosalinde, that\nmay bee chosen out of the grosse band of the vnfaithfull:\ntherefore beware my censure, and keep your promise\n\n   Orl. With no lesse religion, then if thou wert indeed\nmy Rosalind: so adieu\n\n   Ros. Well, Time is the olde Iustice that examines all\nsuch offenders, and let time try: adieu.\nEnter.\n\n  Cel. You haue simply misus'd our sexe in your loue-prate:\nwe must haue your doublet and hose pluckt ouer\nyour head, and shew the world what the bird hath done\nto her owne neast\n\n   Ros. O coz, coz, coz: my pretty little coz, that thou\ndidst know how many fathome deepe I am in loue: but\nit cannot bee sounded: my affection hath an vnknowne\nbottome, like the Bay of Portugall\n\n   Cel. Or rather bottomlesse, that as fast as you poure\naffection in, it runs out\n\n   Ros. No, that same wicked Bastard of Venus, that was\nbegot of thought, conceiu'd of spleene, and borne of\nmadnesse, that blinde rascally boy, that abuses euery\nones eyes, because his owne are out, let him bee iudge,\nhow deepe I am in loue: ile tell thee Aliena, I cannot be\nout of the sight of Orlando: Ile goe finde a shadow, and\nsigh till he come\n\n   Cel. And Ile sleepe.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\n\nScena Secunda.\n\nEnter Iaques and Lords, Forresters.\n\n  Iaq. Which is he that killed the Deare?\n  Lord. Sir, it was I\n\n   Iaq. Let's present him to the Duke like a Romane\nConquerour, and it would doe well to set the Deares\nhorns vpon his head, for a branch of victory; haue you\nno song Forrester for this purpose?\n  Lord. Yes Sir\n\n   Iaq. Sing it: 'tis no matter how it bee in tune, so it\nmake noyse enough.\n\nMusicke, Song.\n\nWhat shall he haue that kild the Deare?\nHis Leather skin, and hornes to weare:\nThen sing him home, the rest shall beare this burthen;\nTake thou no scorne to weare the horne,\nIt was a crest ere thou wast borne,\nThy fathers father wore it,\nAnd thy father bore it,\nThe horne, the horne, the lusty horne,\nIs not a thing to laugh to scorne.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nScoena Tertia.\n\nEnter Rosalind and Celia.\n\n  Ros. How say you now, is it not past two a clock?\nAnd heere much Orlando\n\n   Cel. I warrant you, with pure loue, & troubled brain,\nEnter Siluius.\n\nHe hath t'ane his bow and arrowes, and is gone forth\nTo sleepe: looke who comes heere\n\n   Sil. My errand is to you, faire youth,\nMy gentle Phebe, did bid me giue you this:\nI know not the contents, but as I guesse\nBy the sterne brow, and waspish action\nWhich she did vse, as she was writing of it,\nIt beares an angry tenure; pardon me,\nI am but as a guiltlesse messenger\n\n   Ros. Patience her selfe would startle at this letter,\nAnd play the swaggerer, beare this, beare all:\nShee saies I am not faire, that I lacke manners,\nShe calls me proud, and that she could not loue me\nWere man as rare as Phenix: 'od's my will,\nHer loue is not the Hare that I doe hunt,\nWhy writes she so to me? well Shepheard, well,\nThis is a Letter of your owne deuice\n\n   Sil. No, I protest, I know not the contents,\nPhebe did write it\n\n   Ros. Come, come, you are a foole,\nAnd turn'd into the extremity of loue.\nI saw her hand, she has a leatherne hand,\nA freestone coloured hand: I verily did thinke\nThat her old gloues were on, but twas her hands:\nShe has a huswiues hand, but that's no matter:\nI say she neuer did inuent this letter,\nThis is a mans inuention, and his hand\n\n   Sil. Sure it is hers\n\n   Ros. Why, tis a boysterous and a cruell stile,\nA stile for challengers: why, she defies me,\nLike Turke to Christian: womens gentle braine\nCould not drop forth such giant rude inuention,\nSuch Ethiop words, blacker in their effect\nThen in their countenance: will you heare the letter?\n  Sil. So please you, for I neuer heard it yet:\nYet heard too much of Phebes crueltie\n\n   Ros. She Phebes me: marke how the tyrant writes.\n\nRead.\n\nArt thou god, to Shepherd turn'd?\nThat a maidens heart hath burn'd.\nCan a woman raile thus?\n  Sil. Call you this railing?\n  Ros.\n\nRead.\n\nWhy, thy godhead laid a part,\nWar'st thou with a womans heart?\nDid you euer heare such railing?\nWhiles the eye of man did wooe me,\nThat could do no vengeance to me.\nMeaning me a beast.\nIf the scorne of your bright eine\nHaue power to raise such loue in mine,\nAlacke, in me, what strange effect\nWould they worke in milde aspect?\nWhiles you chid me, I did loue,\nHow then might your praiers moue?\nHe that brings this loue to thee,\nLittle knowes this Loue in me:\nAnd by him seale vp thy minde,\nWhether that thy youth and kinde\nWill the faithfull offer take\nOf me, and all that I can make,\nOr else by him my loue denie,\nAnd then Ile studie how to die\n\n   Sil. Call you this chiding?\n  Cel. Alas poore Shepheard\n\n   Ros. Doe you pitty him? No, he deserues no pitty:\nwilt thou loue such a woman? what to make thee an instrument,\nand play false straines vpon thee? not to be endur'd.\nWell, goe your way to her; (for I see Loue hath\nmade thee a tame snake) and say this to her; That if she\nloue me, I charge her to loue thee: if she will not, I will\nneuer haue her, vnlesse thou intreat for her: if you bee a\ntrue louer hence, and not a word; for here comes more\ncompany.\n\nExit.

West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom\nThe ranke of Oziers, by the murmuring streame\nLeft on your right hand, brings you to the place:\nBut at this howre, the house doth keepe it selfe,\nThere's none within\n\n   Oli. If that an eye may profit by a tongue,\nThen should I know you by description,\nSuch garments, and such yeeres: the boy is faire,\nOf femall fauour, and bestowes himselfe\nLike a ripe sister: the woman low\nAnd browner then her brother: are not you\nThe owner of the house I did enquire for?\n  Cel. It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are\n\n   Oli. Orlando doth commend him to you both,\nAnd to that youth hee calls his Rosalind,\nHe sends this bloudy napkin; are you he?\n  Ros. I am: what must we vnderstand by this?\n  Oli. Some of my shame, if you will know of me\nWhat man I am, and how, and why, and where\nThis handkercher was stain'd\n\n   Cel. I pray you tell it\n\n   Oli. When last the yong Orlando parted from you,\nHe left a promise to returne againe\nWithin an houre, and pacing through the Forrest,\nChewing the food of sweet and bitter fancie,\nLoe what befell: he threw his eye aside,\nAnd marke what obiect did present it selfe\nVnder an old Oake, whose bows were moss'd with age\nAnd high top, bald with drie antiquitie:\nA wretched ragged man, ore-growne with haire\nLay sleeping on his back; about his necke\nA greene and guilded snake had wreath'd it selfe,\nWho with her head, nimble in threats approach'd\nThe opening of his mouth: but sodainly\nSeeing Orlando, it vnlink'd it selfe,\nAnd with indented glides, did slip away\nInto a bush, vnder which bushes shade\nA Lyonnesse, with vdders all drawne drie,\nLay cowching head on ground, with catlike watch\nWhen that the sleeping man should stirre; for 'tis\nThe royall disposition of that beast\nTo prey on nothing, that doth seeme as dead:\nThis seene, Orlando did approach the man,\nAnd found it was his brother, his elder brother\n\n   Cel. O I haue heard him speake of that same brother,\nAnd he did render him the most vnnaturall\nThat liu'd amongst men\n\n   Oli. And well he might so doe,\nFor well I know he was vnnaturall\n\n   Ros. But to Orlando: did he leaue him there\nFood to the suck'd and hungry Lyonnesse?\n  Oli. Twice did he turne his backe, and purpos'd so:\nBut kindnesse, nobler euer then reuenge,\nAnd Nature stronger then his iust occasion,\nMade him giue battell to the Lyonnesse:\nWho quickly fell before him, in which hurtling\nFrom miserable slumber I awaked\n\n   Cel. Are you his brother?\n  Ros. Was't you he rescu'd?\n  Cel. Was't you that did so oft contriue to kill him?\n  Oli. 'Twas I: but 'tis not I: I doe not shame\nTo tell you what I was, since my conuersion\nSo sweetly tastes, being the thing I am\n\n   Ros. But for the bloody napkin?\n  Oli. By and by:\nWhen from the first to last betwixt vs two,\nTeares our recountments had most kindely bath'd,\nAs how I came into that Desert place.\nIn briefe, he led me to the gentle Duke,\nWho gaue me fresh aray, and entertainment,\nCommitting me vnto my brothers loue,\nWho led me instantly vnto his Caue,\nThere stript himselfe, and heere vpon his arme\nThe Lyonnesse had torne some flesh away,\nWhich all this while had bled; and now he fainted,\nAnd cride in fainting vpon Rosalinde.\nBriefe, I recouer'd him, bound vp his wound,\nAnd after some small space, being strong at heart,\nHe sent me hither, stranger as I am\nTo tell this story, that you might excuse\nHis broken promise, and to giue this napkin\nDied in this bloud, vnto the Shepheard youth,\nThat he in sport doth call his Rosalind\n\n   Cel. Why how now Ganimed, sweet Ganimed\n\n   Oli. Many will swoon when they do look on bloud\n\n   Cel. There is more in it; Cosen Ganimed\n\n   Oli. Looke, he recouers\n\n   Ros. I would I were at home\n\n   Cel. Wee'll lead you thither:\nI pray you will you take him by the arme\n\n   Oli. Be of good cheere youth: you a man?\nYou lacke a mans heart\n\n   Ros. I doe so, I confesse it:\nAh, sirra, a body would thinke this was well counterfeited,\nI pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited:\nheigh-ho\n\n   Oli. This was not counterfeit, there is too great testimony\nin your complexion, that it was a passion of earnest\n\n   Ros. Counterfeit, I assure you\n\n   Oli. Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to\nbe a man\n\n   Ros. So I doe: but yfaith, I should haue beene a woman\nby right\n\n   Cel. Come, you looke paler and paler: pray you draw\nhomewards: good sir, goe with vs\n\n   Oli. That will I: for I must beare answere backe\nHow you excuse my brother, Rosalind\n\n   Ros. I shall deuise something: but I pray you commend\nmy counterfeiting to him: will you goe?\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nActus Quintus. Scena Prima.\n\n\nEnter Clowne and Awdrie.\n\n  Clow.

I sir, I haue a prettie wit\n\n   Clo. Why, thou saist well. I do now remember a saying:\nThe Foole doth thinke he is wise, but the wiseman\nknowes himselfe to be a Foole. The Heathen Philosopher,\nwhen he had a desire to eate a Grape, would open\nhis lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby,\nthat Grapes were made to eate, and lippes to open.\nYou do loue this maid?\n  Will. I do sir\n\n   Clo. Giue me your hand: Art thou Learned?\n  Will. No sir\n\n   Clo. Then learne this of me, To haue, is to haue.

Did your brother tell you how I counterfeyted\nto sound, when he shew'd me your handkercher?\n  Orl. I, and greater wonders then that\n\n   Ros. O, I know where you are: nay, tis true: there\nwas neuer any thing so sodaine, but the sight of two\nRammes, and Cesars Thrasonicall bragge of I came, saw,\nand ouercome. For your brother, and my sister, no sooner\nmet, but they look'd: no sooner look'd, but they\nlou'd; no sooner lou'd, but they sigh'd: no sooner sigh'd\nbut they ask'd one another the reason: no sooner knew\nthe reason, but they sought the remedie: and in these\ndegrees, haue they made a paire of staires to marriage,\nwhich they will climbe incontinent, or else bee incontinent\nbefore marriage; they are in the verie wrath of\nloue, and they will together. Clubbes cannot part\nthem\n\n   Orl. They shall be married to morrow: and I will\nbid the Duke to the Nuptiall. But O, how bitter a thing\nit is, to looke into happines through another mans eies:\nby so much the more shall I to morrow be at the height\nof heart heauinesse, by how much I shal thinke my brother\nhappie, in hauing what he wishes for\n\n   Ros. Why then to morrow, I cannot serue your turne\nfor Rosalind?\n  Orl. I can liue no longer by thinking\n\n   Ros. I will wearie you then no longer with idle talking.\nKnow of me then (for now I speake to some purpose)\nthat I know you are a Gentleman of good conceit:\nI speake not this, that you should beare a good opinion\nof my knowledge: insomuch (I say) I know you are: neither\ndo I labor for a greater esteeme then may in some\nlittle measure draw a beleefe from you, to do your selfe\ngood, and not to grace me. Beleeue then, if you please,\nthat I can do strange things: I haue since I was three\nyeare old conuerst with a Magitian, most profound in\nhis Art, and yet not damnable. If you do loue Rosalinde\nso neere the hart, as your gesture cries it out: when your\nbrother marries Aliena, shall you marrie her. I know into\nwhat straights of Fortune she is driuen, and it is not\nimpossible to me, if it appeare not inconuenient to you,\nto set her before your eyes to morrow, humane as she is,\nand without any danger\n\n   Orl. Speak'st thou in sober meanings?\n  Ros. By my life I do, which I tender deerly, though\nI say I am a Magitian: Therefore put you in your best aray,\nbid your friends: for if you will be married to morrow,\nyou shall: and to Rosalind if you will.\nEnter Siluius & Phebe.\n\nLooke, here comes a Louer of mine, and a louer of hers\n\n   Phe. Youth, you haue done me much vngentlenesse,\nTo shew the letter that I writ to you\n\n   Ros. I care not if I haue: it is my studie\nTo seeme despightfull and vngentle to you:\nyou are there followed by a faithful shepheard,\nLooke vpon him, loue him: he worships you\n\n   Phe. Good shepheard, tell this youth what 'tis to loue\n  Sil. It is to be all made of sighes and teares,\nAnd so am I for Phebe\n\n   Phe. And I for Ganimed\n\n   Orl. And I for Rosalind\n\n   Ros. And I for no woman\n\n   Sil. It is to be all made of faith and seruice,\nAnd so am I for Phebe\n\n   Phe. And I for Ganimed\n\n   Orl. And I for Rosalind\n\n   Ros. And I for no woman\n\n   Sil. It is to be all made of fantasie,\nAll made of passion, and all made of wishes,\nAll adoration, dutie, and obseruance,\nAll humblenesse, all patience, and impatience,\nAll puritie, all triall, all obseruance:\nAnd so am I for Phebe\n\n   Phe. And so am I for Ganimed\n\n   Orl. And so am I for Rosalind\n\n   Ros. And so am I for no woman\n\n   Phe. If this be so, why blame you me to loue you?\n  Sil. If this be so, why blame you me to loue you?\n  Orl. If this be so, why blame you me to loue you?\n  Ros. Why do you speake too, Why blame you mee\nto loue you\n\n   Orl. To her, that is not heere, nor doth not heare\n\n   Ros. Pray you no more of this, 'tis like the howling\nof Irish Wolues against the Moone: I will helpe you\nif I can: I would loue you if I could: To morrow meet\nme altogether: I wil marrie you, if euer I marrie Woman,\nand Ile be married to morrow: I will satisfie you,\nif euer I satisfi'd man, and you shall bee married to morrow.\nI wil content you, if what pleases you contents\nyou, and you shal be married to morrow: As you loue\nRosalind meet, as you loue Phebe meet, and as I loue no\nwoman, Ile meet: so fare you wel: I haue left you commands\n\n   Sil. Ile not faile, if I liue\n\n   Phe. Nor I\n\n   Orl. Nor I.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nScoena Tertia.\n\nEnter Clowne and Audrey.\n\n  Clo. To morrow is the ioyfull day Audrey, to morow\nwill we be married\n\n   Aud. I do desire it with all my heart: and I hope it is\nno dishonest desire, to desire to be a woman of y world?\nHeere come two of the banish'd Dukes Pages.\nEnter two Pages.\n\n  1.Pa. Wel met honest Gentleman\n\n   Clo. By my troth well met: come, sit, sit, and a song\n\n   2.Pa. We are for you, sit i'th middle\n\n   1.Pa. Shal we clap into't roundly, without hauking,\nor spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the onely\nprologues to a bad voice\n\n   2.Pa.

Truly yong Gentlemen, though there was no\ngreat matter in the dittie, yet y note was very vntunable\n  1.Pa. you are deceiu'd Sir, we kept time, we lost not\nour time\n\n   Clo. By my troth yes: I count it but time lost to heare\nsuch a foolish song. God buy you, and God mend your\nvoices. Come Audrie.\n\nExeunt.\n\n\nScena Quarta.\n\nEnter Duke Senior, Amyens, Iaques, Orlando, Oliuer, Celia.\n\n  Du.Sen. Dost thou beleeue Orlando, that the boy\nCan do all this that he hath promised?\n  Orl. I sometimes do beleeue, and somtimes do not,\nAs those that feare they hope, and know they feare.\nEnter Rosalinde, Siluius, & Phebe.\n\n  Ros. Patience once more, whiles our co[m]pact is vrg'd:\nYou say, if I bring in your Rosalinde,\nYou wil bestow her on Orlando heere?\n  Du.Se. That would I, had I kingdoms to giue with hir\n\n   Ros. And you say you wil haue her, when I bring hir?\n  Orl. That would I, were I of all kingdomes King\n\n   Ros. You say, you'l marrie me, if I be willing\n\n   Phe. That will I, should I die the houre after\n\n   Ros. But if you do refuse to marrie me,\nYou'l giue your selfe to this most faithfull Shepheard\n\n   Phe. So is the bargaine\n\n   Ros. You say that you'l haue Phebe if she will\n\n   Sil. Though to haue her and death, were both one\nthing\n\n   Ros. I haue promis'd to make all this matter euen:\nKeepe you your word, O Duke, to giue your daughter,\nYou yours Orlando, to receiue his daughter:\nKeepe you your word Phebe, that you'l marrie me,\nOr else refusing me to wed this shepheard:\nKeepe your word Siluius, that you'l marrie her\nIf she refuse me, and from hence I go\nTo make these doubts all euen.\n\nExit Ros. and Celia.\n\n  Du.Sen. I do remember in this shepheard boy,\nSome liuely touches of my daughters fauour\n\n   Orl. My Lord, the first time that I euer saw him,\nMe thought he was a brother to your daughter:\nBut my good Lord, this Boy is Forrest borne,\nAnd hath bin tutor'd in the rudiments\nOf many desperate studies, by his vnckle,\nWhom he reports to be a great Magitian.\nEnter Clowne and Audrey.\n\nObscured in the circle of this Forrest\n\n   Iaq. There is sure another flood toward, and these\ncouples are comming to the Arke. Here comes a payre\nof verie strange beasts, which in all tongues, are call'd\nFooles\n\n   Clo. Salutation and greeting to you all\n\n   Iaq. Good my Lord, bid him welcome: This is the\nMotley-minded Gentleman, that I haue so often met in\nthe Forrest: he hath bin a Courtier he sweares\n\n   Clo. If any man doubt that, let him put mee to my\npurgation, I haue trod a measure, I haue flattred a Lady,\nI haue bin politicke with my friend, smooth with mine\nenemie, I haue vndone three Tailors, I haue had foure\nquarrels, and like to haue fought one\n\n   Iaq. And how was that tane vp?\n  Clo. 'Faith we met, and found the quarrel was vpon\nthe seuenth cause\n\n   Iaq. How seuenth cause? Good my Lord, like this\nfellow\n\n   Du.Se. I like him very well\n\n   Clo. God'ild you sir, I desire you of the like: I presse\nin heere sir, amongst the rest of the Country copulatiues\nto sweare, and to forsweare, according as mariage binds\nand blood breakes: a poore virgin sir, an il-fauor'd thing\nsir, but mine owne, a poore humour of mine sir, to take\nthat that no man else will: rich honestie dwels like a miser\nsir, in a poore house, as your Pearle in your foule oyster\n\n   Du.Se. By my faith, he is very swift, and sententious\n  Clo. According to the fooles bolt sir, and such dulcet\ndiseases\n\n   Iaq. But for the seuenth cause. How did you finde\nthe quarrell on the seuenth cause?\n  Clo. Vpon a lye, seuen times remoued: (beare your\nbodie more seeming Audry) as thus sir: I did dislike the\ncut of a certaine Courtiers beard: he sent me word, if I\nsaid his beard was not cut well, hee was in the minde it\nwas: this is call'd the retort courteous. If I sent him\nword againe, it was not well cut, he wold send me word\nhe cut it to please himselfe: this is call'd the quip modest.\nIf againe, it was not well cut, he disabled my iudgment:\nthis is called, the reply churlish. If againe it was not well\ncut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call'd the\nreproofe valiant. If againe, it was not well cut, he wold\nsay, I lie: this is call'd the counter-checke quarrelsome:\nand so to lye circumstantiall, and the lye direct\n\n   Iaq. And how oft did you say his beard was not well\ncut?\n  Clo. I durst go no further then the lye circumstantial:\nnor he durst not giue me the lye direct: and so wee measur'd\nswords, and parted\n\n   Iaq. Can you nominate in order now, the degrees of\nthe lye\n\n   Clo. O sir, we quarrel in print, by the booke: as you\nhaue bookes for good manners: I will name you the degrees.\nThe first, the Retort courteous: the second, the\nQuip-modest: the third, the reply Churlish: the fourth,\nthe Reproofe valiant: the fift, the Counterchecke quarrelsome:\nthe sixt, the Lye with circumstance: the seauenth,\nthe Lye direct: all these you may auoyd, but the\nLye direct: and you may auoide that too, with an If. I\nknew when seuen Iustices could not take vp a Quarrell,\nbut when the parties were met themselues, one of them\nthought but of an If; as if you saide so, then I saide so:\nand they shooke hands, and swore brothers. Your If, is\nthe onely peace-maker: much vertue in if\n\n   Iaq. Is not this a rare fellow my Lord? He's as good\nat any thing, and yet a foole\n\n   Du.Se. He vses his folly like a stalking-horse, and vnder\nthe presentation of that he shoots his wit.\nEnter Hymen, Rosalind, and Celia.\n\nStill Musicke.\n\n  Hymen. Then is there mirth in heauen,\nWhen earthly things made eauen\nattone together.\nGood Duke receiue thy daughter,\nHymen from Heauen brought her,\nYea brought her hether.\nThat thou mightst ioyne his hand with his,\nWhose heart within his bosome is\n\n   Ros. To you I giue my selfe, for I am yours.\nTo you I giue my selfe, for I am yours\n\n   Du.Se. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter\n\n   Orl. If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind\n\n   Phe. If sight & shape be true, why then my loue adieu\n  Ros. Ile haue no Father, if you be not he:\nIle haue no Husband, if you be not he:\nNor ne're wed woman, if you be not shee\n\n   Hy. Peace hoa: I barre confusion,\n'Tis I must make conclusion\nOf these most strange euents:\nHere's eight that must take hands,\nTo ioyne in Hymens bands,\nIf truth holds true contents.\nYou and you, no crosse shall part;\nYou and you, are hart in hart:\nYou, to his loue must accord,\nOr haue a Woman to your Lord.\nYou and you, are sure together,\nAs the Winter to fowle Weather:\nWhiles a Wedlocke Hymne we sing,\nFeede your selues with questioning:\nThat reason, wonder may diminish\nHow thus we met, and these things finish.\n\nSong.\n\nWedding is great Iunos crowne,\nO blessed bond of boord and bed:\n'Tis Hymen peoples euerie towne,\nHigh wedlock then be honored:\nHonor, high honor and renowne\nTo Hymen, God of euerie Towne\n\n   Du.Se. O my deere Neece, welcome thou art to me,\nEuen daughter welcome, in no lesse degree\n\n   Phe. I wil not eate my word, now thou art mine,\nThy faith, my fancie to thee doth combine.\nEnter Second Brother.\n\n  2.Bro. Let me haue audience for a word or two:\nI am the second sonne of old Sir Rowland,\nThat bring these tidings to this faire assembly.\nDuke Frederick hearing how that euerie day\nMen of great worth resorted to this forrest,\nAddrest a mightie power, which were on foote\nIn his owne conduct, purposely to take\nHis brother heere, and put him to the sword:\nAnd to the skirts of this wilde Wood he came;\nWhere, meeting with an old Religious man,\nAfter some question with him, was conuerted\nBoth from his enterprize, and from the world:\nHis crowne bequeathing to his banish'd Brother,\nAnd all their Lands restor'd to him againe\nThat were with him exil'd. This to be true,\nI do engage my life\n\n   Du.Se. Welcome yong man:\nThou offer'st fairely to thy brothers wedding:\nTo one his lands with-held, and to the other\nA land it selfe at large, a potent Dukedome.\nFirst, in this Forrest, let vs do those ends\nThat heere were well begun, and wel begot:\nAnd after, euery of this happie number\nThat haue endur'd shrew'd daies, and nights with vs,\nShal share the good of our returned fortune,\nAccording to the measure of their states.\nMeane time, forget this new-falne dignitie,\nAnd fall into our Rusticke Reuelrie:\nPlay Musicke, and you Brides and Bride-groomes all,\nWith measure heap'd in ioy, to'th Measures fall\n\n   Iaq. Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly,\nThe Duke hath put on a Religious life,\nAnd throwne into neglect the pompous Court\n\n   2.Bro. He hath\n\n   Iaq. To him will I: out of these conuertites,\nThere is much matter to be heard, and learn'd:\nyou to your former Honor, I bequeath\nyour patience, and your vertue, well deserues it.\nyou to a loue, that your true faith doth merit:\nyou to your land, and loue, and great allies:\nyou to a long, and well-deserued bed:\nAnd you to wrangling, for thy louing voyage\nIs but for two moneths victuall'd: So to your pleasures,\nI am for other, then for dancing meazures\n\n   Du.Se. Stay, Iaques, stay\n\n   Iaq. To see no pastime, I: what you would haue,\nIle stay to know, at your abandon'd caue.\nEnter.\n\n  Du.Se. Proceed, proceed: wee'l begin these rights,\nAs we do trust, they'l end in true delights.\n\nExit\n\n  Ros. It is not the fashion to see the Ladie the Epilogue:\nbut it is no more vnhandsome, then to see the\nLord the Prologue. If it be true, that good wine needs\nno bush, 'tis true, that a good play needes no Epilogue.\nYet to good wine they do vse good bushes: and good\nplayes proue the better by the helpe of good Epilogues:\nWhat a case am I in then, that am neither a good Epilogue,\nnor cannot insinuate with you in the behalfe of a\ngood play? I am not furnish'd like a Begger, therefore\nto begge will not become mee. My way is to coniure\nyou, and Ile begin with the Women. I charge you (O\nwomen) for the loue you beare to men, to like as much\nof this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men)\nfor the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your\nsimpring, none of you hates them) that betweene you,\nand the women, the play may please. If I were a Woman,\nI would kisse as many of you as had beards that\npleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that\nI defi'de not: And I am sure, as many as haue good\nbeards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind\noffer, when I make curt'sie, bid me farewell.\nEnter.\n\nFINIS. As you Like it.\n"

SCENE I.\nRome. A street.\n\nEnter Flavius, Marullus, and certain Commoners.\n\n  FLAVIUS. Hence, home, you idle creatures, get you home.\n    Is this a holiday? What, know you not,\n    Being mechanical, you ought not walk\n    Upon a laboring day without the sign\n    Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?\n  FIRST COMMONER. Why, sir, a carpenter.\n  MARULLUS. Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?\n    What dost thou with thy best apparel on?\n    You, sir, what trade are you?\n  SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am\n    but, as you would say, a cobbler.\n  MARULLUS. But what trade art thou? Answer me directly.\n  SECOND COMMONER. A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a\nsafe\n    conscience, which is indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.\n  MARULLUS. What trade, thou knave? Thou naughty knave, what\ntrade?\n  SECOND COMMONER. Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me;\nyet,\n    if you be out, sir, I can mend you. \n  MARULLUS. What mean\'st thou by that? Mend me, thou saucy\nfellow!\n  SECOND COMMONER. Why, sir, cobble you.\n  FLAVIUS. Thou art a cobbler, art thou?\n  SECOND COMMONER. Truly, Sir, all that I live by is with the\nawl; I\n    meddle with no tradesman\'s matters, nor women\'s matters, but\nwith\n    awl. I am indeed, sir, a surgeon to old shoes; when they are\nin\n    great danger, I recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon\n    neat\'s leather have gone upon my handiwork.\n  FLAVIUS. But wherefore art not in thy shop today?\n    Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?\n  SECOND COMMONER. Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes to get\nmyself\n    into more work. But indeed, sir, we make holiday to see\nCaesar\n    and to rejoice in his triumph.\n  MARULLUS. Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?\n    What tributaries follow him to Rome\n    To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels?\n    You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!\n    O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,\n    Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft\n    Have you climb\'d up to walls and battlements, \n    To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,\n    Your infants in your arms, and there have sat\n    The livelong day with patient expectation\n    To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.\n    And when you saw his chariot but appear,\n    Have you not made an universal shout\n    That Tiber trembled underneath her banks\n    To hear the replication of your sounds\n    Made in her concave shores?\n    And do you now put on your best attire?\n    And do you now cull out a holiday?\n    And do you now strew flowers in his way\n    That comes in triumph over Pompey\'s blood?\n    Be gone!\n    Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,\n    Pray to the gods to intermit the plague\n    That needs must light on this ingratitude.\n  FLAVIUS. Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,\n    Assemble all the poor men of your sort,\n    Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears \n    Into the channel, till the lowest stream\n    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.\n                                           Exeunt all Commoners.\n    See whether their basest metal be not moved;\n    They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.\n    Go you down that way towards the Capitol;\n    This way will I. Disrobe the images\n    If you do find them deck\'d with ceremonies.\n  MARULLUS. May we do so?\n    You know it is the feast of Lupercal.\n  FLAVIUS. It is no matter; let no images\n    Be hung with Caesar\'s trophies. I\'ll about\n    And drive away the vulgar from the streets;\n    So do you too, where you perceive them thick.\n    These growing feathers pluck\'d from Caesar\'s wing\n    Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,\n    Who else would soar above the view of men\n    And keep us all in servile fearfulness.              Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nA public place.\n\nFlourish. Enter Caesar; Antony, for the course; Calpurnia,\nPortia,\nDecius, Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Casca; a great crowd\nfollows,\namong them a Soothsayer.\n\n  CAESAR. Calpurnia!\n  CASCA. Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.\n                                                   Music ceases.\n  CAESAR. Calpurnia!\n  CALPURNIA. Here, my lord.\n  CAESAR. Stand you directly in Antonio\'s way,\n    When he doth run his course. Antonio!\n  ANTONY. Caesar, my lord?\n  CAESAR. Forget not in your speed, Antonio,\n    To touch Calpurnia, for our elders say\n    The barren, touched in this holy chase,\n    Shake off their sterile curse.\n  ANTONY. I shall remember.\n    When Caesar says "Do this," it is perform\'d.\n  CAESAR. Set on, and leave no ceremony out.           Flourish. \n  SOOTHSAYER. Caesar!\n  CAESAR. Ha! Who calls?\n  CASCA. Bid every noise be still. Peace yet again!\n  CAESAR. Who is it in the press that calls on me?\n    I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,\n    Cry "Caesar." Speak, Caesar is turn\'d to hear.\n  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.\n  CAESAR. What man is that?\n  BRUTUS. A soothsayer you beware the ides of March.\n  CAESAR. Set him before me let me see his face.\n  CASSIUS. Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.\n  CAESAR. What say\'st thou to me now? Speak once again.\n  SOOTHSAYER. Beware the ides of March.\n  CAESAR. He is a dreamer; let us leave him. Pass.\n                      Sennet. Exeunt all but Brutus and Cassius.\n  CASSIUS. Will you go see the order of the course?\n  BRUTUS. Not I.\n  CASSIUS. I pray you, do.\n  BRUTUS. I am not gamesome; I do lack some part\n    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. \n    Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;\n    I\'ll leave you.\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;\n    I have not from your eyes that gentleness\n    And show of love as I was wont to have;\n    You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand\n    Over your friend that loves you.\n  BRUTUS. Cassius,\n    Be not deceived; if I have veil\'d my look,\n    I turn the trouble of my countenance\n    Merely upon myself. Vexed I am\n    Of late with passions of some difference,\n    Conceptions only proper to myself,\n    Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;\n    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-\n    Among which number, Cassius, be you one-\n    Nor construe any further my neglect\n    Than that poor Brutus with himself at war\n    Forgets the shows of love to other men.\n  CASSIUS. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion, \n    By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried\n    Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.\n    Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?\n  BRUTUS. No, Cassius, for the eye sees not itself\n    But by reflection, by some other things.\n  CASSIUS. \'Tis just,\n    And it is very much lamented, Brutus,\n    That you have no such mirrors as will turn\n    Your hidden worthiness into your eye\n    That you might see your shadow. I have heard\n    Where many of the best respect in Rome,\n    Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus\n    And groaning underneath this age\'s yoke,\n    Have wish\'d that noble Brutus had his eyes.\n  BRUTUS. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,\n    That you would have me seek into myself\n    For that which is not in me?\n  CASSIUS. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear,\n    And since you know you cannot see yourself\n    So well as by reflection, I your glass \n    Will modestly discover to yourself\n    That of yourself which you yet know not of.\n    And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus;\n    Were I a common laugher, or did use\n    To stale with ordinary oaths my love\n    To every new protester, if you know\n    That I do fawn on men and hug them hard\n    And after scandal them, or if you know\n    That I profess myself in banqueting\n    To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.\n                                             Flourish and shout.\n  BRUTUS. What means this shouting? I do fear the people\n    Choose Caesar for their king.\n  CASSIUS. Ay, do you fear it?\n    Then must I think you would not have it so.\n  BRUTUS. I would not, Cassius, yet I love him well.\n    But wherefore do you hold me here so long?\n    What is it that you would impart to me?\n    If it be aught toward the general good,\n    Set honor in one eye and death i\' the other \n    And I will look on both indifferently.\n    For let the gods so speed me as I love\n    The name of honor more than I fear death.\n  CASSIUS. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,\n    As well as I do know your outward favor.\n    Well, honor is the subject of my story.\n    I cannot tell what you and other men\n    Think of this life, but, for my single self,\n    I had as lief not be as live to be\n    In awe of such a thing as I myself.\n    I was born free as Caesar, so were you;\n    We both have fed as well, and we can both\n    Endure the winter\'s cold as well as he.\n    For once, upon a raw and gusty day,\n    The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,\n    Caesar said to me, "Darest thou, Cassius, now\n    Leap in with me into this angry flood\n    And swim to yonder point?" Upon the word,\n    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in\n    And bade him follow. So indeed he did. \n    The torrent roar\'d, and we did buffet it\n    With lusty sinews, throwing it aside\n    And stemming it with hearts of controversy.\n    But ere we could arrive the point proposed,\n    Caesar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink!\n    I, as Aeneas our great ancestor\n    Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder\n    The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber\n    Did I the tired Caesar. And this man\n    Is now become a god, and Cassius is\n    A wretched creature and must bend his body\n    If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.\n    He had a fever when he was in Spain,\n    And when the fit was on him I did mark\n    How he did shake. \'Tis true, this god did shake;\n    His coward lips did from their color fly,\n    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world\n    Did lose his luster. I did hear him groan.\n    Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans\n    Mark him and write his speeches in their books, \n    Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"\n    As a sick girl. Ye gods! It doth amaze me\n    A man of such a feeble temper should\n    So get the start of the majestic world\n    And bear the palm alone. Shout.                    Flourish.\n  BRUTUS. Another general shout!\n    I do believe that these applauses are\n    For some new honors that are heap\'d on Caesar.\n  CASSIUS. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world\n    Like a Colossus, and we petty men\n    Walk under his huge legs and peep about\n    To find ourselves dishonorable graves.\n    Men at some time are masters of their fates:\n    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,\n    But in ourselves that we are underlings.\n    Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that "Caesar"?\n    Why should that name be sounded more than yours?\n    Write them together, yours is as fair a name;\n    Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;\n    Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with \'em, \n    "Brutus" will start a spirit as soon as "Caesar."\n    Now, in the names of all the gods at once,\n    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed\n    That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!\n    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\n    When went there by an age since the great flood\n    But it was famed with more than with one man?\n    When could they say till now that talk\'d of Rome\n    That her wide walls encompass\'d but one man?\n    Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough,\n    When there is in it but one only man.\n    O, you and I have heard our fathers say\n    There was a Brutus once that would have brook\'d\n    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome\n    As easily as a king.\n  BRUTUS. That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;\n    What you would work me to, I have some aim.\n    How I have thought of this and of these times,\n    I shall recount hereafter; for this present,\n    I would not, so with love I might entreat you, \n    Be any further moved. What you have said\n    I will consider; what you have to say\n    I will with patience hear, and find a time\n    Both meet to hear and answer such high things.\n    Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:\n    Brutus had rather be a villager\n    Than to repute himself a son of Rome\n    Under these hard conditions as this time\n    Is like to lay upon us.\n  CASSIUS. I am glad that my weak words\n    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.\n\n            Re-enter Caesar and his Train.\n\n  BRUTUS. The games are done, and Caesar is returning.\n  CASSIUS. As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve,\n    And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you\n    What hath proceeded worthy note today.\n  BRUTUS. I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,\n    The angry spot doth glow on Caesar\'s brow, \n    And all the rest look like a chidden train:\n    Calpurnia\'s cheek is pale, and Cicero\n    Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes\n    As we have seen him in the Capitol,\n    Being cross\'d in conference by some senators.\n  CASSIUS. Casca will tell us what the matter is.\n  CAESAR. Antonio!\n  ANTONY. Caesar?\n  CAESAR. Let me have men about me that are fat,\n    Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o\' nights:\n    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;\n    He thinks too much; such men are dangerous.\n  ANTONY. Fear him not, Caesar; he\'s not dangerous;\n    He is a noble Roman and well given.\n  CAESAR. Would he were fatter! But I fear him not,\n    Yet if my name were liable to fear,\n    I do not know the man I should avoid\n    So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much,\n    He is a great observer, and he looks\n    Quite through the deeds of men. He loves no plays, \n    As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;\n    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort\n    As if he mock\'d himself and scorn\'d his spirit\n    That could be moved to smile at anything.\n    Such men as he be never at heart\'s ease\n    Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,\n    And therefore are they very dangerous.\n    I rather tell thee what is to be fear\'d\n    Than what I fear, for always I am Caesar.\n    Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,\n    And tell me truly what thou think\'st of him.\n              Sennet. Exeunt Caesar and all his Train but Casca.\n  CASCA. You pull\'d me by the cloak; would you speak with me?\n  BRUTUS. Ay, Casca, tell us what hath chanced today\n    That Caesar looks so sad.\n  CASCA. Why, you were with him, were you not?\n  BRUTUS. I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.\n  CASCA. Why, there was a crown offered him, and being offered\nhim,\n     he put it by with the back of his hand, thus, and then the\n     people fell ashouting. \n  BRUTUS. What was the second noise for?\n  CASCA. Why, for that too.\n  CASSIUS. They shouted thrice. What was the last cry for?\n  CASCA. Why, for that too.\n  BRUTUS. Was the crown offered him thrice?\n  CASCA. Ay, marry, wast, and he put it by thrice, every time\ngentler\n    than other, and at every putting by mine honest neighbors\n    shouted.\n  CASSIUS. Who offered him the crown?\n  CASCA. Why, Antony.\n  BRUTUS. Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.\n  CASCA. I can as well be hang\'d as tell the manner of it. It was\n    mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark Antony offer him\na\n    crown (yet \'twas not a crown neither, \'twas one of these\n    coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once. But for all\n    that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he\noffered\n    it to him again; then he put it by again. But, to my\nthinking, he\n    was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered\nit\n    the third time; he put it the third time by; and still as he\n    refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chopped\nhands \n    and threw up their sweaty nightcaps and uttered such a deal\nof\n    stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had\n    almost choked Caesar, for he swounded and fell down at it.\nAnd\n    for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my\nlips\n    and receiving the bad air.\n  CASSIUS. But, soft, I pray you, what, did Caesars wound?\n  CASCA. He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at mouth and\nwas\n    speechless.\n  BRUTUS. \'Tis very like. He hath the falling sickness.\n  CASSIUS. No, Caesar hath it not, but you, and I,\n    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.\n  CASCA. I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure Caesar\nfell\n    down. If the tagrag people did not clap him and hiss him\n    according as he pleased and displeased them, as they use to\ndo\n    the players in the theatre, I am no true man.\n  BRUTUS. What said he when he came unto himself?\n  CASCA. Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the common\n    herd was glad he refused the crown, he plucked me ope his\ndoublet\n    and offered them his throat to cut. An had been a man of any\n    occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, I would\nI \n    might go to hell among the rogues. And so he fell. When he\ncame\n    to himself again, he said, if he had done or said anything\namiss,\n    he desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.\nThree or\n    four wenches where I stood cried, "Alas, good soul!" and\nforgave\n    him with all their hearts. But there\'s no heed to be taken of\n    them; if Caesar had stabbed their mothers, they would have\ndone\n    no less.\n  BRUTUS. And after that he came, thus sad, away?\n  CASCA. Ay.\n  CASSIUS. Did Cicero say anything?\n  CASCA. Ay, he spoke Greek.\n  CASSIUS. To what effect?\n  CASCA. Nay, an I tell you that, I\'ll ne\'er look you i\' the face\n    again; but those that understood him smiled at one another\nand\n    shook their heads; but for mine own part, it was Greek to me.\nI\n    could tell you more news too: Marullus and Flavius, for\npulling\n    scarfs off Caesar\'s images, are put to silence. Fare you\nwell.\n    There was more foolery yet, if could remember it.\n  CASSIUS. Will you sup with me tonight, Casca?\n  CASCA. No, I am promised forth. \n  CASSIUS. Will you dine with me tomorrow?\n  CASCA. Ay, if I be alive, and your mind hold, and your dinner\nworth\n    the eating.\n  CASSIUS. Good, I will expect you.\n  CASCA. Do so, farewell, both.                            Exit.\n  BRUTUS. What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!\n    He was quick mettle when he went to school.\n  CASSIUS. So is he now in execution\n    Of any bold or noble enterprise,\n    However he puts on this tardy form.\n    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,\n    Which gives men stomach to digest his words\n    With better appetite.\n  BRUTUS. And so it is. For this time I will leave you.\n    Tomorrow, if you please to speak with me,\n    I will come home to you, or, if you will,\n    Come home to me and I will wait for you.\n  CASSIUS. I will do so. Till then, think of the world.\n                                                    Exit Brutus.\n    Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see \n    Thy honorable mettle may be wrought\n    From that it is disposed; therefore it is meet\n    That noble minds keep ever with their likes;\n    For who so firm that cannot be seduced?\n    Caesar doth bear me hard, but he loves Brutus.\n    If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,\n    He should not humor me. I will this night,\n    In several hands, in at his windows throw,\n    As if they came from several citizens,\n    Writings, all tending to the great opinion\n    That Rome holds of his name, wherein obscurely\n    Caesar\'s ambition shall be glanced at.\n    And after this let Caesar seat him sure;\n    For we will shake him, or worse days endure.           Exit.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nA street. Thunder and lightning.\n\nEnter, from opposite sides, Casca, with his sword drawn, and\nCicero.\n\n  CICERO. Good even, Casca. Brought you Caesar home?\n    Why are you breathless, and why stare you so?\n  CASCA. Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth\n    Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,\n    I have seen tempests when the scolding winds\n    Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen\n    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam\n    To be exalted with the threatening clouds,\n    But never till tonight, never till now,\n    Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.\n    Either there is a civil strife in heaven,\n    Or else the world too saucy with the gods\n    Incenses them to send destruction.\n  CICERO. Why, saw you anything more wonderful?\n  CASCA. A common slave- you know him well by sight-\n    Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn \n    Like twenty torches join\'d, and yet his hand\n    Not sensible of fire remain\'d unscorch\'d.\n    Besides- I ha\' not since put up my sword-\n    Against the Capitol I met a lion,\n    Who glaz\'d upon me and went surly by\n    Without annoying me. And there were drawn\n    Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women\n    Transformed with their fear, who swore they saw\n    Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.\n    And yesterday the bird of night did sit\n    Even at noonday upon the marketplace,\n    Howling and shrieking. When these prodigies\n    Do so conjointly meet, let not men say\n    "These are their reasons; they are natural":\n    For I believe they are portentous things\n    Unto the climate that they point upon.\n  CICERO. Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time.\n    But men may construe things after their fashion,\n    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.\n    Comes Caesar to the Capitol tomorrow? \n  CASCA. He doth, for he did bid Antonio\n    Send word to you he would be there tomorrow.\n  CICERO. Good then, Casca. This disturbed sky\n    Is not to walk in.\n  CASCA. Farewell, Cicero.                          Exit Cicero.\n\n                        Enter Cassius.\n\n  CASSIUS. Who\'s there?\n  CASCA. A Roman.\n  CASSIUS. Casca, by your voice.\n  CASCA. Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!\n  CASSIUS. A very pleasing night to honest men.\n  CASCA. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?\n  CASSIUS. Those that have known the earth so full of faults.\n    For my part, I have walk\'d about the streets,\n    Submitting me unto the perilous night,\n    And thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,\n    Have bared my bosom to the thunderstone;\n    And when the cross blue lightning seem\'d to open \n    The breast of heaven, I did present myself\n    Even in the aim and very flash of it.\n  CASCA. But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?\n    It is the part of men to fear and tremble\n    When the most mighty gods by tokens send\n    Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.\n  CASSIUS. You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life\n    That should be in a Roman you do want,\n    Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze\n    And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder\n    To see the strange impatience of the heavens.\n    But if you would consider the true cause\n    Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,\n    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,\n    Why old men, fools, and children calculate,\n    Why all these things change from their ordinance,\n    Their natures, and preformed faculties\n    To monstrous quality, why, you shall find\n    That heaven hath infused them with these spirits\n    To make them instruments of fear and warning \n    Unto some monstrous state.\n    Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man\n    Most like this dreadful night,\n    That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars\n    As doth the lion in the Capitol,\n    A man no mightier than thyself or me\n    In personal action, yet prodigious grown\n    And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.\n  CASCA. \'Tis Caesar that you mean, is it not, Cassius?\n  CASSIUS. Let it be who it is, for Romans now\n    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors.\n    But, woe the while! Our fathers\' minds are dead,\n    And we are govern\'d with our mothers\' spirits;\n    Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.\n  CASCA. Indeed they say the senators tomorrow\n    Mean to establish Caesar as a king,\n    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land\n    In every place save here in Italy.\n  CASSIUS. I know where I will wear this dagger then:\n    Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius. \n    Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;\n    Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat.\n    Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,\n    Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron\n    Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;\n    But life, being weary of these worldly bars,\n    Never lacks power to dismiss itself.\n    If I know this, know all the world besides,\n    That part of tyranny that I do bear\n    I can shake off at pleasure.                  Thunder still.\n  CASCA. So can I.\n    So every bondman in his own hand bears\n    The power to cancel his captivity.\n  CASSIUS. And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?\n    Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf\n    But that he sees the Romans are but sheep.\n    He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.\n    Those that with haste will make a mighty fire\n    Begin it with weak straws. What trash is Rome,\n    What rubbish, and what offal, when it serves \n    For the base matter to illuminate\n    So vile a thing as Caesar? But, O grief,\n    Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this\n    Before a willing bondman; then I know\n    My answer must be made. But I am arm\'d,\n    And dangers are to me indifferent.\n  CASCA. You speak to Casca, and to such a man\n    That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand.\n    Be factious for redress of all these griefs,\n    And I will set this foot of mine as far\n    As who goes farthest.\n  CASSIUS. There\'s a bargain made.\n    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already\n    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans\n    To undergo with me an enterprise\n    Of honorable-dangerous consequence;\n    And I do know by this, they stay for me\n    In Pompey\'s Porch. For now, this fearful night,\n    There is no stir or walking in the streets,\n    And the complexion of the element \n    In favor\'s like the work we have in hand,\n    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.\n\n                       Enter Cinna.\n\n  CASCA. Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.\n  CASSIUS. \'Tis Cinna, I do know him by his gait;\n    He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so?\n  CINNA. To find out you. Who\'s that? Metellus Cimber?\n  CASSIUS. No, it is Casca, one incorporate\n    To our attempts. Am I not stay\'d for, Cinna?\n  CINNA. I am glad on\'t. What a fearful night is this!\n    There\'s two or three of us have seen strange sights.\n  CASSIUS. Am I not stay\'d for? Tell me.\n  CINNA. Yes, you are.\n    O Cassius, if you could\n    But win the noble Brutus to our party-\n  CASSIUS. Be you content. Good Cinna, take this paper,\n    And look you lay it in the praetor\'s chair,\n    Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this \n    In at his window; set this up with wax\n    Upon old Brutus\' statue. All this done,\n    Repair to Pompey\'s Porch, where you shall find us.\n    Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?\n  CINNA. All but Metellus Cimber, and he\'s gone\n    To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie\n    And so bestow these papers as you bade me.\n  CASSIUS. That done, repair to Pompey\'s Theatre.\n                                                     Exit Cinna.\n    Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day\n    See Brutus at his house. Three parts of him\n    Is ours already, and the man entire\n    Upon the next encounter yields him ours.\n  CASCA. O, he sits high in all the people\'s hearts,\n    And that which would appear offense in us,\n    His countenance, like richest alchemy,\n    Will change to virtue and to worthiness.\n  CASSIUS. Him and his worth and our great need of him\n    You have right well conceited. Let us go,\n    For it is after midnight, and ere day \n    We will awake him and be sure of him.                Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

What, Lucius, ho!\n    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,\n    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!\n    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.\n    When, Lucius, when? Awake, I say! What, Lucius!\n\n                            Enter Lucius.\n\n  LUCIUS. Call\'d you, my lord?\n  BRUTUS. Get me a taper in my study, Lucius.\n    When it is lighted, come and call me here.\n  LUCIUS. I will, my lord.                                 Exit.\n  BRUTUS. It must be by his death, and, for my part,\n    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,\n    But for the general. He would be crown\'d:\n    How that might change his nature, there\'s the question.\n    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder\n    And that craves wary walking. Crown him that, \n    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him\n    That at his will he may do danger with.\n    The abuse of greatness is when it disjoins\n    Remorse from power, and, to speak truth of Caesar,\n    I have not known when his affections sway\'d\n    More than his reason. But \'tis a common proof\n    That lowliness is young ambition\'s ladder,\n    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;\n    But when he once attains the upmost round,\n    He then unto the ladder turns his back,\n    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\n    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may;\n    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel\n    Will bear no color for the thing he is,\n    Fashion it thus, that what he is, augmented,\n    Would run to these and these extremities;\n    And therefore think him as a serpent\'s egg\n    Which hatch\'d would as his kind grow mischievous,\n    And kill him in the shell.\n \n                        Re-enter Lucius.\n\n  LUCIUS. The taper burneth in your closet, sir.\n    Searching the window for a flint I found\n    This paper thus seal\'d up, and I am sure\n    It did not lie there when I went to bed.\n                                           Gives him the letter.\n  BRUTUS. Get you to bed again, it is not day.\n    Is not tomorrow, boy, the ides of March?\n  LUCIUS. I know not, sir.\n  BRUTUS. Look in the calendar and bring me word.\n  LUCIUS. I will, sir.                                     Exit.\n  BRUTUS. The exhalations whizzing in the air\n    Give so much light that I may read by them.\n                                     Opens the letter and reads.\n    "Brutus, thou sleep\'st: awake and see thyself!\n    Shall Rome, etc. Speak, strike, redress!"\n\n    "Brutus, thou sleep\'st: awake!"\n    Such instigations have been often dropp\'d \n    Where I have took them up.\n    "Shall Rome, etc." Thus must I piece it out.\n    Shall Rome stand under one man\'s awe? What, Rome?\n    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome\n    The Tarquin drive, when he was call\'d a king.\n    "Speak, strike, redress!" Am I entreated\n    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise,\n    If the redress will follow, thou receivest\n    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!\n\n                        Re-enter Lucius.\n\n  LUCIUS. Sir, March is wasted fifteen days.\n                                                Knocking within.\n  BRUTUS. \'Tis good. Go to the gate, somebody knocks.\n                                                    Exit Lucius.\n    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar\n    I have not slept.\n    Between the acting of a dreadful thing\n    And the first motion, all the interim is \n    Like a phantasma or a hideous dream;\n    The genius and the mortal instruments\n    Are then in council, and the state of man,\n    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then\n    The nature of an insurrection.\n\n                         Re-enter Lucius.\n\n  LUCIUS. Sir, \'tis your brother Cassius at the door,\n    Who doth desire to see you.\n  BRUTUS. Is he alone?\n  LUCIUS. No, sir, there are more with him.\n  BRUTUS. Do you know them?\n  LUCIUS. No, sir, their hats are pluck\'d about their ears,\n    And half their faces buried in their cloaks,\n    That by no means I may discover them\n    By any mark of favor.\n  BRUTUS. Let \'em enter.                            Exit Lucius.\n    They are the faction. O Conspiracy,\n    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night, \n    When evils are most free? O, then, by day\n    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough\n    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, Conspiracy;\n    Hide it in smiles and affability;\n    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,\n    Not Erebus itself were dim enough\n    To hide thee from prevention.\n\n    Enter the conspirators, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Cinna,\n                Metellus Cimber, and Trebonius.\n\n  CASSIUS. I think we are too bold upon your rest.\n    Good morrow, Brutus, do we trouble you?\n  BRUTUS. I have been up this hour, awake all night.\n    Know I these men that come along with you?\n  CASSIUS. Yes, every man of them, and no man here\n    But honors you, and every one doth wish\n    You had but that opinion of yourself\n    Which every noble Roman bears of you.\n    This is Trebonius. \n  BRUTUS. He is welcome hither.\n  CASSIUS. This, Decius Brutus.\n  BRUTUS. He is welcome too.\nCASSIUS. This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.\n  BRUTUS. They are all welcome.\n    What watchful cares do interpose themselves\n    Betwixt your eyes and night?\n  CASSIUS. Shall I entreat a word?                 They whisper.\n  DECIUS. Here lies the east. Doth not the day break here?\n  CASCA. No.\n  CINNA. O, pardon, sir, it doth, and yongrey lines\n    That fret the clouds are messengers of day.\n  CASCA. You shall confess that you are both deceived.\n    Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,\n    Which is a great way growing on the south,\n    Weighing the youthful season of the year.\n    Some two months hence up higher toward the north\n    He first presents his fire, and the high east\n    Stands as the Capitol, directly here.\n  BRUTUS. Give me your hands all over, one by one.\n  CASSIUS. And let us swear our resolution. \n  BRUTUS. No, not an oath. If not the face of men,\n    The sufferance of our souls, the time\'s abuse-\n    If these be motives weak, break off betimes,\n    And every man hence to his idle bed;\n    So let high-sighted tyranny range on\n    Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,\n    As I am sure they do, bear fire enough\n    To kindle cowards and to steel with valor\n    The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,\n    What need we any spur but our own cause\n    To prick us to redress? What other bond\n    Than secret Romans that have spoke the word\n    And will not palter? And what other oath\n    Than honesty to honesty engaged\n    That this shall be or we will fall for it?\n    Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,\n    Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls\n    That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear\n    Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain\n    The even virtue of our enterprise, \n    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,\n    To think that or our cause or our performance\n    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood\n    That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,\n    Is guilty of a several bastardy\n    If he do break the smallest particle\n    Of any promise that hath pass\'d from him.\n  CASSIUS. But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him?\n    I think he will stand very strong with us.\n  CASCA. Let us not leave him out.\n  CINNA. No, by no means.\n  METELLUS. O, let us have him, for his silver hairs\n    Will purchase us a good opinion,\n    And buy men\'s voices to commend our deeds.\n    It shall be said his judgement ruled our hands;\n    Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,\n    But all be buried in his gravity.\n  BRUTUS. O, name him not; let us not break with him,\n    For he will never follow anything\n    That other men begin. \n  CASSIUS. Then leave him out.\n  CASCA. Indeed he is not fit.\n  DECIUS. Shall no man else be touch\'d but only Caesar?\n  CASSIUS. Decius, well urged. I think it is not meet\n    Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,\n    Should outlive Caesar. We shall find of him\n    A shrewd contriver; and you know his means,\n    If he improve them, may well stretch so far\n    As to annoy us all, which to prevent,\n    Let Antony and Caesar fall together.\n  BRUTUS. Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,\n    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs\n    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;\n    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar.\n    Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.\n    We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar,\n    And in the spirit of men there is no blood.\n    O, that we then could come by Caesar\'s spirit,\n    And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,\n    Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends, \n    Let\'s kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;\n    Let\'s carve him as a dish fit for the gods,\n    Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds;\n    And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,\n    Stir up their servants to an act of rage\n    And after seem to chide \'em. This shall make\n    Our purpose necessary and not envious,\n    Which so appearing to the common eyes,\n    We shall be call\'d purgers, not murderers.\n    And for Mark Antony, think not of him,\n    For he can do no more than Caesar\'s arm\n    When Caesar\'s head is off.\n  CASSIUS. Yet I fear him,\n    For in the ingrated love he bears to Caesar-\n  BRUTUS. Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him.\n    If he love Caesar, all that he can do\n    Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar.\n    And that were much he should, for he is given\n    To sports, to wildness, and much company.\n  TREBONIUS. There is no fear in him-let him not die, \n    For he will live and laugh at this hereafter.\n                                                  Clock strikes.\n  BRUTUS. Peace, count the clock.\n  CASSIUS. The clock hath stricken three.\n  TREBONIUS. \'Tis time to part.\n  CASSIUS. But it is doubtful yet\n    Whether Caesar will come forth today or no,\n    For he is superstitious grown of late,\n    Quite from the main opinion he held once\n    Of fantasy, of dreams, and ceremonies.\n    It may be these apparent prodigies,\n    The unaccustom\'d terror of this night,\n    And the persuasion of his augurers\n    May hold him from the Capitol today.\n  DECIUS. Never fear that. If he be so resolved,\n    I can o\'ersway him, for he loves to hear\n    That unicorns may be betray\'d with trees,\n    And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,\n    Lions with toils, and men with flatterers;\n    But when I tell him he hates flatterers, \n    He says he does, being then most flattered.\n    Let me work;\n    For I can give his humor the true bent,\n    And I will bring him to the Capitol.\n  CASSIUS. Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.\n  BRUTUS. By the eighth hour. Is that the utter most?\n  CINNA. Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.\n  METELLUS. Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,\n    Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey.\n    I wonder none of you have thought of him.\n  BRUTUS. Now, good Metellus, go along by him.\n    He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;\n    Send him but hither, and I\'ll fashion him.\n  CASSIUS. The morning comes upon \'s. We\'ll leave you, Brutus,\n    And, friends, disperse yourselves, but all remember\n    What you have said and show yourselves true Romans.\n  BRUTUS. Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;\n    Let not our looks put on our purposes,\n    But bear it as our Roman actors do,\n    With untired spirits and formal constancy. \n    And so, good morrow to you every one.\n                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.\n    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter.\n    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber;\n    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,\n    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;\n    Therefore thou sleep\'st so sound.\n\n                           Enter Portia.\n\n  PORTIA. Brutus, my lord!\n  BRUTUS. Portia, what mean you? Wherefore rise you now?\n    It is not for your health thus to commit\n    Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.\n  PORTIA. Nor for yours neither. have ungently, Brutus,\n    Stole from my bed; and yesternight at supper\n    You suddenly arose and walk\'d about,\n    Musing and sighing, with your arms across;\n    And when I ask\'d you what the matter was,\n    You stared upon me with ungentle looks. \n    I urged you further; then you scratch\'d your head,\n    And too impatiently stamp\'d with your foot.\n    Yet I insisted, yet you answer\'d not,\n    But with an angry waiter of your hand\n    Gave sign for me to leave you. So I did,\n    Fearing to strengthen that impatience\n    Which seem\'d too much enkindled, and withal\n    Hoping it was but an effect of humor,\n    Which sometime hath his hour with every man.\n    It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,\n    And, could it work so much upon your shape\n    As it hath much prevail\'d on your condition,\n    I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,\n    Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.\n  BRUTUS. I am not well in health, and that is all.\n  PORTIA. Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,\n    He would embrace the means to come by it.\n  BRUTUS. Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.\n  PORTIA. Is Brutus sick, and is it physical\n    To walk unbraced and suck up the humors \n    Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,\n    And will he steal out of his wholesome bed\n    To dare the vile contagion of the night\n    And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air\n    To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus,\n    You have some sick offense within your mind,\n    Which by the right and virtue of my place\n    I ought to know of; and, upon my knees,\n    I charm you, by my once commended beauty,\n    By all your vows of love and that great vow\n    Which did incorporate and make us one,\n    That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,\n    Why you are heavy and what men tonight\n    Have had resort to you; for here have been\n    Some six or seven, who did hide their faces\n    Even from darkness.\n  BRUTUS. Kneel not, gentle Portia.\n  PORTIA. I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.\n    Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,\n    Is it excepted I should know no secrets \n    That appertain to you? Am I yourself\n    But, as it were, in sort or limitation,\n    To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,\n    And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs\n    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,\n    Portia is Brutus\' harlot, not his wife.\n  BRUTUS. You are my true and honorable wife,\n    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops\n    That visit my sad heart.\n  PORTIA. If this were true, then should I know this secret.\n    I grant I am a woman, but withal\n    A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife.\n    I grant I am a woman, but withal\n    A woman well reputed, Cato\'s daughter.\n    Think you I am no stronger than my sex,\n    Being so father\'d and so husbanded?\n    Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose \'em.\n    I have made strong proof of my constancy,\n    Giving myself a voluntary wound\n    Here in the thigh. Can I bear that with patience \n    And not my husband\'s secrets?\n  BRUTUS. O ye gods,\n    Render me worthy of this noble wife! Knocking within.\n    Hark, hark, one knocks. Portia, go in awhile,\n    And by and by thy bosom shall partake\n    The secrets of my heart.\n    All my engagements I will construe to thee,\n    All the charactery of my sad brows.\n    Leave me with haste. [Exit Portia.] Lucius, who\'s that\nknocks?\n\n                  Re-enter Lucius with Ligarius.\n\n  LUCIUS. Here is a sick man that would speak with you.\n  BRUTUS. Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.\n    Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how?\n  LIGARIUS. Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.\n  BRUTUS. O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,\n    To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!\n  LIGARIUS. I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand\n    Any exploit worthy the name of honor. \n  BRUTUS. Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,\n    Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.\n  LIGARIUS. By all the gods that Romans bow before,\n    I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!\n    Brave son, derived from honorable loins!\n    Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up\n    My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,\n    And I will strive with things impossible,\n    Yea, get the better of them. What\'s to do?\n  BRUTUS. A piece of work that will make sick men whole.\n  LIGARIUS. But are not some whole that we must make sick?\n  BRUTUS. That must we also. What it is, my Caius,\n    I shall unfold to thee, as we are going\n    To whom it must be done.\n  LIGARIUS. Set on your foot,\n    And with a heart new-fired I follow you,\n    To do I know not what; but it sufficeth\n    That Brutus leads me on.\n  BRUTUS. Follow me then.                                Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nCaesar\'s house. Thunder and lightning.\n\nEnter Caesar, in his nightgown.\n\n  CAESAR. Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace tonight.\n    Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,\n    "Help, ho! They murther Caesar!" Who\'s within?\n\n                         Enter a Servant.\n\n  SERVANT. My lord?\n  CAESAR. Go bid the priests do present sacrifice,\n    And bring me their opinions of success.\n  SERVANT. I will, my lord.                                Exit.\n\n                         Enter Calpurnia.\n\n  CALPURNIA. What mean you, Caesar? Think you to walk forth?\n    You shall not stir out of your house today.\n  CAESAR. Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten\'d me\n    Ne\'er look\'d but on my back; when they shall see \n    The face of Caesar, they are vanished.\n  CALPURNIA. Caesar, I I stood on ceremonies,\n    Yet now they fright me. There is one within,\n    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,\n    Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.\n    A lioness hath whelped in the streets;\n    And graves have yawn\'d, and yielded up their dead;\n    Fierce fiery warriors fight upon the clouds,\n    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,\n    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;\n    The noise of battle hurtled in the air,\n    Horses did neigh and dying men did groan,\n    And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.\n    O Caesar! These things are beyond all use,\n    And I do fear them.\n  CAESAR. What can be avoided\n    Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?\n    Yet Caesar shall go forth, for these predictions\n    Are to the world in general as to Caesar.\n  CALPURNIA. When beggars die, there are no comets seen; \n    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.\n  CAESAR. Cowards die many times before their deaths;\n    The valiant never taste of death but once.\n    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard,\n    It seems to me most strange that men should fear\n    Seeing that death, a necessary end,\n    Will come when it will come.\n\n                      Re-enter Servant.\n\n    What say the augurers?\n  SERVANT. They would not have you to stir forth today.\n    Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,\n    They could not find a heart within the beast.\n  CAESAR. The gods do this in shame of cowardice.\n    Caesar should be a beast without a heart\n    If he should stay at home today for fear.\n    No, Caesar shall not. Danger knows full well\n    That Caesar is more dangerous than he.\n    We are two lions litter\'d in one day, \n    And I the elder and more terrible.\n    And Caesar shall go forth.\n  CALPURNIA. Alas, my lord,\n    Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.\n    Do not go forth today. Call it my fear\n    That keeps you in the house and not your own.\n    We\'ll send Mark Antony to the Senate House,\n    And he shall say you are not well today.\n    Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.\n  CAESAR. Mark Antony shall say I am not well,\n    And, for thy humor, I will stay at home.\n\n                        Enter Decius.\n\n    Here\'s Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.\n  DECIUS. Caesar, all hail! Good morrow, worthy Caesar!\n    I come to fetch you to the Senate House.\n  CAESAR. And you are come in very happy time\n    To bear my greeting to the senators\n    And tell them that I will not come today. \n    Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:\n    I will not come today. Tell them so, Decius.\n  CALPURNIA. Say he is sick.\n  CAESAR. Shall Caesar send a lie?\n    Have I in conquest stretch\'d mine arm so far\n    To be afeard to tell greybeards the truth?\n    Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.\n  DECIUS. Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,\n    Lest I be laugh\'d at when I tell them so.\n  CAESAR. The cause is in my will: I will not come,\n    That is enough to satisfy the Senate.\n    But, for your private satisfaction,\n    Because I love you, I will let you know.\n    Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home;\n    She dreamt tonight she saw my statue,\n    Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,\n    Did run pure blood, and many lusty Romans\n    Came smiling and did bathe their hands in it.\n    And these does she apply for warnings and portents\n    And evils imminent, and on her knee \n    Hath begg\'d that I will stay at home today.\n  DECIUS. This dream is all amiss interpreted;\n    It was a vision fair and fortunate.\n    Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,\n    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,\n    Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck\n    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press\n    For tinctures, stains, relics, and cognizance.\n    This by Calpurnia\'s dream is signified.\n  CAESAR. And this way have you well expounded it.\n  DECIUS. I have, when you have heard what I can say.\n    And know it now, the Senate have concluded\n    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.\n    If you shall send them word you will not come,\n    Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock\n    Apt to be render\'d, for someone to say\n    "Break up the Senate till another time,\n    When Caesar\'s wife shall meet with better dreams."\n    If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper\n    "Lo, Caesar is afraid"? \n    Pardon me, Caesar, for my dear dear love\n    To your proceeding bids me tell you this,\n    And reason to my love is liable.\n  CAESAR. How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!\n    I am ashamed I did yield to them.\n    Give me my robe, for I will go.\n\n         Enter Publius, Brutus, Ligarius, Metellus, Casca,\n                     Trebonius, and Cinna.\n\n    And look where Publius is come to fetch me.\n  PUBLIUS. Good morrow,Caesar.\n  CAESAR. Welcome, Publius.\n    What, Brutus, are you stirr\'d so early too?\n    Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,\n    Caesar was ne\'er so much your enemy\n    As that same ague which hath made you lean.\n    What is\'t o\'clock?\n  BRUTUS. Caesar, \'tis strucken eight.\n  CAESAR. I thank you for your pains and courtesy. \n\n                           Enter Antony.\n\n    See, Antony, that revels long o\' nights,\n    Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.\n  ANTONY. So to most noble Caesar.\n  CAESAR. Bid them prepare within.\n    I am to blame to be thus waited for.\n    Now, Cinna; now, Metellus; what, Trebonius,\n    I have an hour\'s talk in store for you;\n    Remember that you call on me today;\n    Be near me, that I may remember you.\n  TREBONIUS. Caesar, I will. [Aside.] And so near will I be\n    That your best friends shall wish I had been further.\n  CAESAR. Good friends, go in and taste some wine with me,\n    And we like friends will straightway go together.\n  BRUTUS. [Aside.] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,\n    The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!            Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nA street near the Capitol.\n\nEnter Artemidorus, reading paper.\n\n  ARTEMIDORUS. "Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;\ncome\n    not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna; trust not Trebonius;\nmark\n    well Metellus Cimber; Decius Brutus loves thee not; thou hast\n    wronged Caius Ligarius. There is but one mind in all these\nmen,\n    and it is bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,\nlook\n    about you. Security gives way to conspiracy. The mighty gods\n    defend thee!\n                                        Thy lover, Artemidorus."\n    Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,\n    And as a suitor will I give him this.\n    My heart laments that virtue cannot live\n    Out of the teeth of emulation.\n    If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayest live;\n    If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.           Exit.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nAnother part of the same street, before the house of Brutus.\n\nEnter Portia and Lucius.\n\n  PORTIA. I prithee, boy, run to the Senate House;\n    Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone.\n    Why dost thou stay?\n  LUCIUS. To know my errand, madam.\n  PORTIA. I would have had thee there, and here again,\n    Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.\n    O constancy, be strong upon my side!\n    Set a huge mountain \'tween my heart and tongue!\n    I have a man\'s mind, but a woman\'s might.\n    How hard it is for women to keep counsel!\n    Art thou here yet?\n  LUCIUS. Madam, what should I do?\n    Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?\n    And so return to you, and nothing else?\n  PORTIA. Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,\n    For he went sickly forth; and take good note\n    What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him. \n    Hark, boy, what noise is that?\n  LUCIUS. I hear none, madam.\n  PORTIA. Prithee, listen well.\n    I heard a bustling rumor like a fray,\n    And the wind brings it from the Capitol.\n  LUCIUS. Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.\n\n                     Enter the Soothsayer.\n\n  PORTIA. Come hither, fellow;\n    Which way hast thou been?\n  SOOTHSAYER. At mine own house, good lady.\n  PORTIA. What is\'t o\'clock?\n  SOOTHSAYER. About the ninth hour, lady.\n  PORTIA. Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?\n  SOOTHSAYER. Madam, not yet. I go to take my stand\n    To see him pass on to the Capitol.\n  PORTIA. Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?\n  SOOTHSAYER. That I have, lady. If it will please Caesar\n    To be so good to Caesar as to hear me, \n    I shall beseech him to befriend himself.\n  PORTIA. Why, know\'st thou any harm\'s intended towards him?\n  SOOTHSAYER. None that I know will be, much that I fear may\nchance.\n    Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow,\n    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,\n    Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,\n    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death.\n    I\'ll get me to a place more void and there\n    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.               Exit.\n  PORTIA. I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing\n    The heart of woman is! O Brutus,\n    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!\n    Sure, the boy heard me. Brutus hath a suit\n    That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.\n    Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;\n    Say I am merry. Come to me again,\n    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.\n                                               Exeunt severally.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.\nA crowd of people, among them Artemidorus and the Soothsayer.\n\nFlourish. Enter Caesar, Brutus, Cassius, Casca, Decius, Metellus,\nTrebonius, Cinna, Antony, Lepidus, Popilius, Publius, and others.\n\n  CAESAR. The ides of March are come.\n  SOOTHSAYER. Ay, Caesar, but not gone.\n  A Hail, Caesar! Read this schedule.\n  DECIUS. Trebonius doth desire you to o\'er read,\n    At your best leisure, this his humble suit.\n  ARTEMIDORUS. O Caesar, read mine first, for mine\'s a suit\n    That touches Caesar nearer. Read it, great Caesar.\n  CAESAR. What touches us ourself shall be last served.\n  ARTEMIDORUS. Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.\n  CAESAR. What, is the fellow mad?\n  PUBLIUS. Sirrah, give place.\n  CASSIUS. What, urge you your petitions in the street?\n    Come to the Capitol.\n \n      Caesar goes up to the Senate House, the rest follow.\n\n  POPILIUS. I wish your enterprise today may thrive.\n  CASSIUS. What enterprise, Popilius?\n  POPILIUS. Fare you well.\n                                             Advances to Caesar.\n  BRUTUS. What said Popilius Lena?\n  CASSIUS. He wish\'d today our enterprise might thrive.\n    I fear our purpose is discovered.\n  BRUTUS. Look, how he makes to Caesar. Mark him.\n  CASSIUS. Casca,\n    Be sudden, for we fear prevention.\n    Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,\n    Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,\n    For I will slay myself.\n  BRUTUS. Cassius, be constant.\n    Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;\n    For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.\n  CASSIUS. Trebonius knows his time, for, look you, Brutus,\n    He draws Mark Antony out of the way. \n                                    Exeunt Antony and Trebonius.\n  DECIUS. Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him\n    And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.\n  BRUTUS. He is address\'d; press near and second him.\n  CINNA. Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.\n  CAESAR. Are we all ready? What is now amiss\n    That Caesar and his Senate must redress?\n  METELLUS. Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,\n    Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat\n    An humble heart.                                     Kneels.\n  CAESAR. I must prevent thee, Cimber.\n    These couchings and these lowly courtesies\n    Might fire the blood of ordinary men\n    And turn preordinance and first decree\n    Into the law of children. Be not fond\n    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood\n    That will be thaw\'d from the true quality\n    With that which melteth fools- I mean sweet words,\n    Low-crooked court\'sies, and base spaniel-fawning.\n    Thy brother by decree is banished. \n    If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,\n    I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.\n    Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause\n    Will he be satisfied.\n  METELLUS. Is there no voice more worthy than my own,\n    To sound more sweetly in great Caesar\'s ear\n    For the repealing of my banish\'d brother?\n  BRUTUS. I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar,\n    Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may\n    Have an immediate freedom of repeal.\n  CAESAR. What, Brutus?\n  CASSIUS. Pardon, Caesar! Caesar, pardon!\n    As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall\n    To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.\n  CAESAR. I could be well moved, if I were as you;\n    If I could pray to move, prayers would move me;\n    But I am constant as the northern star,\n    Of whose true-fix\'d and resting quality\n    There is no fellow in the firmament.\n    The skies are painted with unnumber\'d sparks; \n    They are all fire and every one doth shine;\n    But there\'s but one in all doth hold his place.\n    So in the world, \'tis furnish\'d well with men,\n    And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;\n    Yet in the number I do know but one\n    That unassailable holds on his rank,\n    Unshaked of motion; and that I am he,\n    Let me a little show it, even in this;\n    That I was constant Cimber should be banish\'d,\n    And constant do remain to keep him so.\n  CINNA. O Caesar-\n  CAESAR. Hence! Wilt thou lift up Olympus?\n  DECIUS. Great Caesar-\n  CAESAR. Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?\n  CASCA. Speak, hands, for me!\n                        Casca first, then the other Conspirators\n                                  and Marcus Brutus stab Caesar.\n  CAESAR. Et tu, Brute?- Then fall, Caesar! Dies.\n  CINNA. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!\n    Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets. \n  CASSIUS. Some to the common pulpits and cry out\n    "Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!"\n  BRUTUS. People and senators, be not affrighted,\n    Fly not, stand still; ambition\'s debt is paid.\n  CASCA. Go to the pulpit, Brutus.\n  DECIUS. And Cassius too.\n  BRUTUS. Where\'s Publius?\n  CINNA. Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.\n  METELLUS. Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar\'s\n    Should chance-\n  BRUTUS. Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer,\n    There is no harm intended to your person,\n    Nor to no Roman else. So tell them, Publius.\n  CASSIUS. And leave us, Publius, lest that the people\n    Rushing on us should do your age some mischief.\n  BRUTUS. Do so, and let no man abide this deed\n    But we the doers.\n\n                        Re-enter Trebonius.\n \n  CASSIUS. Where is Antony?\n  TREBONIUS. Fled to his house amazed.\n    Men, wives, and children stare, cry out, and run\n    As it were doomsday.\n  BRUTUS. Fates, we will know your pleasures.\n    That we shall die, we know; \'tis but the time\n    And drawing days out that men stand upon.\n  CASSIUS. Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life\n    Cuts off so many years of fearing death.\n  BRUTUS. Grant that, and then is death a benefit;\n    So are we Caesar\'s friends that have abridged\n    His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,\n    And let us bathe our hands in Caesar\'s blood\n    Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords;\n    Then walk we forth, even to the marketplace,\n    And waving our red weapons o\'er our heads,\n    Let\'s all cry, "Peace, freedom, and liberty!"\n  CASSIUS. Stoop then, and wash. How many ages hence\n    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over\n    In states unborn and accents yet unknown! \n  BRUTUS. How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,\n    That now on Pompey\'s basis lies along\n    No worthier than the dust!\n  CASSIUS. So oft as that shall be,\n    So often shall the knot of us be call\'d\n    The men that gave their country liberty.\n  DECIUS. What, shall we forth?\n  CASSIUS. Ay, every man away.\n    Brutus shall lead, and we will grace his heels\n    With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.\n\n                        Enter a Servant.\n\n  BRUTUS. Soft, who comes here? A friend of Antony\'s.\n  SERVANT. Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel,\n    Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down,\n    And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:\n    Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;\n    Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving.\n    Say I love Brutus and I honor him; \n    Say I fear\'d Caesar, honor\'d him, and loved him.\n    If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony\n    May safely come to him and be resolved\n    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,\n    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead\n    So well as Brutus living, but will follow\n    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus\n    Thorough the hazards of this untrod state\n    With all true faith. So says my master Antony.\n  BRUTUS. Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;\n    I never thought him worse.\n    Tell him, so please him come unto this place,\n    He shall be satisfied and, by my honor,\n    Depart untouch\'d.\n  SERVANT. I\'ll fetch him presently.                       Exit.\n  BRUTUS. I know that we shall have him well to friend.\n  CASSIUS. I wish we may, but yet have I a mind\n    That fears him much, and my misgiving still\n    Falls shrewdly to the purpose.\n \n                          Re-enter Antony.\n\n  BRUTUS. But here comes Antony. Welcome, Mark Antony.\n  ANTONY. O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lie so low?\n    Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,\n    Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.\n    I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,\n    Who else must be let blood, who else is rank.\n    If I myself, there is no hour so fit\n    As Caesar\'s death\'s hour, nor no instrument\n    Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich\n    With the most noble blood of all this world.\n    I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,\n    Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,\n    Fulfill your pleasure. Live a thousand years,\n    I shall not find myself so apt to die;\n    No place will please me so, no means of death,\n    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,\n    The choice and master spirits of this age.\n  BRUTUS. O Antony, beg not your death of us! \n    Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,\n    As, by our hands and this our present act\n    You see we do, yet see you but our hands\n    And this the bleeding business they have done.\n    Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;\n    And pity to the general wrong of Rome-\n    As fire drives out fire, so pity pity-\n    Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,\n    To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony;\n    Our arms in strength of malice, and our hearts\n    Of brothers\' temper, do receive you in\n    With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.\n  CASSIUS. Your voice shall be as strong as any man\'s\n    In the disposing of new dignities.\n  BRUTUS. Only be patient till we have appeased\n    The multitude, beside themselves with fear,\n    And then we will deliver you the cause\n    Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,\n    Have thus proceeded.\n  ANTONY. I doubt not of your wisdom. \n    Let each man render me his bloody hand.\n    First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;\n    Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;\n    Now, Decius Brutus, yours; now yours, Metellus;\n    Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;\n    Though last, not least in love, yours, good Trebonius.\n    Gentlemen all- alas, what shall I say?\n    My credit now stands on such slippery ground,\n    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,\n    Either a coward or a flatterer.\n    That I did love thee, Caesar, O, \'tis true!\n    If then thy spirit look upon us now,\n    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death\n    To see thy Antony making his peace,\n    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,\n    Most noble! In the presence of thy corse?\n    Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,\n    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,\n    It would become me better than to close\n    In terms of friendship with thine enemies. \n    Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay\'d, brave hart,\n    Here didst thou fall, and here thy hunters stand,\n    Sign\'d in thy spoil, and crimson\'d in thy Lethe.\n    O world, thou wast the forest to this hart,\n    And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.\n    How like a deer strucken by many princes\n    Dost thou here lie!\n  CASSIUS. Mark Antony-\n  ANTONY. Pardon me, Caius Cassius.\n    The enemies of Caesar shall say this:\n    Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.\n  CASSIUS. I blame you not for praising Caesar so;\n    But what compact mean you to have with us?\n    Will you be prick\'d in number of our friends,\n    Or shall we on, and not depend on you?\n  ANTONY. Therefore I took your hands, but was indeed\n    Sway\'d from the point by looking down on Caesar.\n    Friends am I with you all and love you all,\n    Upon this hope that you shall give me reasons\n    Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous. \n  BRUTUS. Or else were this a savage spectacle.\n    Our reasons are so full of good regard\n    That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,\n    You should be satisfied.\n  ANTONY. That\'s all I seek;\n    And am moreover suitor that I may\n    Produce his body to the marketplace,\n    And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,\n    Speak in the order of his funeral.\n  BRUTUS. You shall, Mark Antony.\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, a word with you.\n    [Aside to Brutus.] You know not what you do. Do not consent\n    That Antony speak in his funeral.\n    Know you how much the people may be moved\n    By that which he will utter?\n  BRUTUS. By your pardon,\n    I will myself into the pulpit first,\n    And show the reason of our Caesar\'s death.\n    What Antony shall speak, I will protest\n    He speaks by leave and by permission, \n    And that we are contented Caesar shall\n    Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.\n    It shall advantage more than do us wrong.\n  CASSIUS. I know not what may fall; I like it not.\n  BRUTUS. Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar\'s body.\n    You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,\n    But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,\n    And say you do\'t by our permission,\n    Else shall you not have any hand at all\n    About his funeral. And you shall speak\n    In the same pulpit whereto I am going,\n    After my speech is ended.\n  ANTONY. Be it so,\n    I do desire no more.\n  BRUTUS. Prepare the body then, and follow us.\n                                          Exeunt all but Antony.\n  ANTONY. O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,\n    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!\n    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man\n    That ever lived in the tide of times. \n    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!\n    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy\n    (Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips\n    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue)\n    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;\n    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife\n    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;\n    Blood and destruction shall be so in use,\n    And dreadful objects so familiar,\n    That mothers shall but smile when they behold\n    Their infants quarter\'d with the hands of war;\n    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds,\n    And Caesar\'s spirit ranging for revenge,\n    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,\n    Shall in these confines with a monarch\'s voice\n    Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war,\n    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth\n    With carrion men, groaning for burial.\n\n                        Enter a Servant. \n\n    You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?\n  SERVANT. I do, Mark Antony.\n  ANTONY. Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.\n  SERVANT. He did receive his letters, and is coming,\n    And bid me say to you by word of mouth-\n    O Caesar!                                     Sees the body.\n  ANTONY. Thy heart is big; get thee apart and weep.\n    Passion, I see, is catching, for mine eyes,\n    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,\n    Began to water. Is thy master coming?\n  SERVANT. He lies tonight within seven leagues of Rome.\n  ANTONY. Post back with speed and tell him what hath chanced.\n    Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,\n    No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;\n    Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay awhile,\n    Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse\n    Into the marketplace. There shall I try,\n    In my oration, how the people take\n    The cruel issue of these bloody men, \n    According to the which thou shalt discourse\n    To young Octavius of the state of things.\n    Lend me your hand.                Exeunt with Caesar\'s body.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nThe Forum.\n\nEnter Brutus and Cassius, and a throng of Citizens.\n\n  CITIZENS. We will be satisfied! Let us be satisfied!\n  BRUTUS. Then follow me and give me audience, friends.\n    Cassius, go you into the other street\n    And part the numbers.\n    Those that will hear me speak, let \'em stay here;\n    Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;\n    And public reasons shall be rendered\n    Of Caesar\'s death.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. I will hear Brutus speak.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. I will hear Cassius and compare their reasons,\n    When severally we hear them rendered.\n                               Exit Cassius, with some Citizens.\n                                    Brutus goes into the pulpit.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. The noble Brutus is ascended. Silence!\n  BRUTUS. Be patient till the last.\n    Romans, countrymen, and lovers! Hear me for my cause, and be\n    silent, that you may hear. Believe me for mine honor, and\nhave \n    respect to mine honor, that you may believe. Censure me in\nyour\n    wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may the better judge.\nIf\n    there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of Caesar\'s,\nto\n    him I say that Brutus\' love to Caesar was no less than his.\nIf\n    then that friend demand why Brutus rose against Caesar, this\nis\n    my answer: Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved\nRome\n    more. Had you rather Caesar were living and die all slaves,\nthan\n    that Caesar were dead to live all freemen? As Caesar loved\nme, I\n    weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was\n    valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambitious, I slew him.\nThere\n    is tears for his love, joy for his fortune, honor for his\nvalor,\n    and death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be\na\n    bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here\nso\n    rude that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I\n    offended. Who is here so vile that will not love his country?\nIf\n    any, speak, for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.\n  ALL. None, Brutus, none.\n  BRUTUS. Then none have I offended. I have done no more to\nCaesar\n    than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death is\n    enrolled in the Capitol, his glory not extenuated, wherein he\nwas \n    worthy, nor his offenses enforced, for which he suffered\ndeath.\n\n              Enter Antony and others, with Caesar\'s body.\n\n    Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony, who, though he\nhad\n    no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying,\na\n    place in the commonwealth, as which of you shall not? With\nthis I\n    depart- that, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome, I\n    have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my\ncountry\n    to need my death.\n  ALL. Live, Brutus, live, live!\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Bring him with triumph home unto his house.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Give him a statue with his ancestors.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him be Caesar.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Caesar\'s better parts\n    Shall be crown\'d in Brutus.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. We\'ll bring him to his house with shouts and\n    clamors.\n  BRUTUS. My countrymen-\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Silence! Brutus speaks. \n  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace, ho!\n  BRUTUS. Good countrymen, let me depart alone,\n    And, for my sake, stay here with Antony.\n    Do grace to Caesar\'s corse, and grace his speech\n    Tending to Caesar\'s glories, which Mark Antony,\n    By our permission, is allow\'d to make.\n    I do entreat you, not a man depart,\n    Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.                  Exit.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Stay, ho, and let us hear Mark Antony.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Let him go up into the public chair;\n    We\'ll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.\n  ANTONY. For Brutus\' sake, I am beholding to you.\n                                           Goes into the pulpit.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. What does he say of Brutus?\n  THIRD CITIZEN. He says, for Brutus\' sake,\n    He finds himself beholding to us all.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. \'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. This Caesar was a tyrant.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, that\'s certain.\n    We are blest that Rome is rid of him. \n  SECOND CITIZEN. Peace! Let us hear what Antony can say.\n  ANTONY. You gentle Romans-\n  ALL. Peace, ho! Let us hear him.\n  ANTONY. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears!\n    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\n    The evil that men do lives after them,\n    The good is oft interred with their bones;\n    So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\n    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious;\n    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,\n    And grievously hath Caesar answer\'d it.\n    Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-\n    For Brutus is an honorable man;\n    So are they all, all honorable men-\n    Come I to speak in Caesar\'s funeral.\n    He was my friend, faithful and just to me;\n    But Brutus says he was ambitious,\n    And Brutus is an honorable man.\n    He hath brought many captives home to Rome,\n    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. \n    Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?\n    When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;\n    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:\n    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,\n    And Brutus is an honorable man.\n    You all did see that on the Lupercal\n    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,\n    Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?\n    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,\n    And sure he is an honorable man.\n    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\n    But here I am to speak what I do know.\n    You all did love him once, not without cause;\n    What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?\n    O judgement, thou art fled to brutish beasts,\n    And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;\n    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\n    And I must pause till it come back to me.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. If thou consider rightly of the matter, \n    Caesar has had great wrong.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Has he, masters?\n    I fear there will a worse come in his place.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Mark\'d ye his words? He would not take the\ncrown;\n    Therefore \'tis certain he was not ambitious.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. If it be found so, some will dear abide it.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Poor soul, his eyes are red as fire with\nweeping.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. There\'s not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Now mark him, he begins again to speak.\n  ANTONY. But yesterday the word of Caesar might\n    Have stood against the world. Now lies he there,\n    And none so poor to do him reverence.\n    O masters! If I were disposed to stir\n    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,\n    I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,\n    Who, you all know, are honorable men.\n    I will not do them wrong; I rather choose\n    To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\n    Than I will wrong such honorable men.\n    But here\'s a parchment with the seal of Caesar; \n    I found it in his closet, \'tis his will.\n    Let but the commons hear this testament-\n    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-\n    And they would go and kiss dead Caesar\'s wounds\n    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,\n    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,\n    And, dying, mention it within their wills,\n    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy\n    Unto their issue.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. We\'ll hear the will. Read it, Mark Antony.\n  ALL. The will, the will! We will hear Caesar\'s will.\n  ANTONY. Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;\n    It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\n    You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;\n    And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,\n    It will inflame you, it will make you mad.\n    \'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs,\n    For if you should, O, what would come of it!\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Read the will; we\'ll hear it, Antony.\n    You shall read us the will, Caesar\'s will. \n  ANTONY. Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\n    I have o\'ershot myself to tell you of it.\n    I fear I wrong the honorable men\n    Whose daggers have stabb\'d Caesar; I do fear it.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. They were traitors. Honorable men!\n  ALL. The will! The testament!\n  SECOND CITIZEN. They were villains, murtherers. The will!\n    Read the will!\n  ANTONY. You will compel me then to read the will?\n    Then make a ring about the corse of Caesar,\n    And let me show you him that made the will.\n    Shall I descend? And will you give me leave?\n  ALL. Come down.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Descend.\n                                  He comes down from the pulpit.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. You shall have leave.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. A ring, stand round.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Room for Antony, most noble Antony.\n  ANTONY. Nay, press not so upon me, stand far off. \n  ALL. Stand back; room, bear back!\n  ANTONY. If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\n    You all do know this mantle. I remember\n    The first time ever Caesar put it on;\n    \'Twas on a summer\'s evening, in his tent,\n    That day he overcame the Nervii.\n    Look, in this place ran Cassius\' dagger through;\n    See what a rent the envious Casca made;\n    Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb\'d;\n    And as he pluck\'d his cursed steel away,\n    Mark how the blood of Caesar follow\'d it,\n    As rushing out of doors, to be resolved\n    If Brutus so unkindly knock\'d, or no;\n    For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar\'s angel.\n    Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!\n    This was the most unkindest cut of all;\n    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\n    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors\' arms,\n    Quite vanquish\'d him. Then burst his mighty heart,\n    And, in his mantle muffling up his face, \n    Even at the base of Pompey\'s statue,\n    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.\n    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\n    Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,\n    Whilst bloody treason flourish\'d over us.\n    O, now you weep, and I perceive you feel\n    The dint of pity. These are gracious drops.\n    Kind souls, what weep you when you but behold\n    Our Caesar\'s vesture wounded? Look you here,\n    Here is himself, marr\'d, as you see, with traitors.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. O piteous spectacle!\n  SECOND CITIZEN. O noble Caesar!\n  THIRD CITIZEN. O woeful day!\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. O traitors villains!\n  FIRST CITIZEN. O most bloody sight!\n  SECOND CITIZEN. We will be revenged.\n  ALL. Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill!\n    Slay! Let not a traitor live!\n  ANTONY. Stay, countrymen.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Peace there! Hear the noble Antony. \n  SECOND CITIZEN. We\'ll hear him, we\'ll follow him, we\'ll die\nwith\n    him.\n  ANTONY. Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\n    To such a sudden flood of mutiny.\n    They that have done this deed are honorable.\n    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\n    That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,\n    And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\n    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts.\n    I am no orator, as Brutus is;\n    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,\n    That love my friend, and that they know full well\n    That gave me public leave to speak of him.\n    For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\n    Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\n    To stir men\'s blood. I only speak right on;\n    I tell you that which you yourselves do know;\n    Show you sweet Caesar\'s wounds, poor dumb mouths,\n    And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,\n    And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony \n    Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue\n    In every wound of Caesar that should move\n    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\n  ALL. We\'ll mutiny.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. We\'ll burn the house of Brutus.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Away, then! Come, seek the conspirators.\n  ANTONY. Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.\n  ALL. Peace, ho! Hear Antony, most noble Antony!\n  ANTONY. Why, friends, you go to do you know not what.\n    Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?\n    Alas, you know not; I must tell you then.\n    You have forgot the will I told you of.\n  ALL. Most true, the will! Let\'s stay and hear the will.\n  ANTONY. Here is the will, and under Caesar\'s seal.\n    To every Roman citizen he gives,\n    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Most noble Caesar! We\'ll revenge his death.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. O royal Caesar!\n  ANTONY. Hear me with patience.\n  ALL. Peace, ho! \n  ANTONY. Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,\n    His private arbors, and new-planted orchards,\n    On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,\n    And to your heirs forever- common pleasures,\n    To walk abroad and recreate yourselves.\n    Here was a Caesar! When comes such another?\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Never, never. Come, away, away!\n    We\'ll burn his body in the holy place\n    And with the brands fire the traitors\' houses.\n    Take up the body.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Go fetch fire.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Pluck down benches.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Pluck down forms, windows, anything.\n                                  Exeunt Citizens with the body.\n  ANTONY. Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,\n    Take thou what course thou wilt.\n\n                        Enter a Servant.\n\n    How now, fellow? \n  SERVANT. Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.\n  ANTONY. Where is he?\n  SERVANT. He and Lepidus are at Caesar\'s house.\n  ANTONY. And thither will I straight to visit him.\n    He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,\n    And in this mood will give us anything.\n  SERVANT. I heard him say Brutus and Cassius\n    Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.\n  ANTONY. Be like they had some notice of the people,\n    How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.          Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nA street.\n\nEnter Cinna the poet.\n\n  CINNA. I dreamt tonight that I did feast with Caesar,\n    And things unluckily charge my fantasy.\n    I have no will to wander forth of doors,\n    Yet something leads me forth.\n\n                        Enter Citizens.\n\n  FIRST CITIZEN. What is your name?\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Whither are you going?\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Where do you dwell?\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Are you a married man or a bachelor?\n  SECOND CITIZEN. Answer every man directly.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Ay, and briefly.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Ay, and wisely.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Ay, and truly, you were best.\n  CINNA. What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I dwell?\nAm I\n    a married man or a bachelor? Then, to answer every man\ndirectly \n    and briefly, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. That\'s as much as to say they are fools that\nmarry.\n    You\'ll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed directly.\n  CINNA. Directly, I am going to Caesar\'s funeral.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. As a friend or an enemy?\n  CINNA. As a friend.\n  SECOND CITIZEN. That matter is answered directly.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. For your dwelling, briefly.\n  CINNA. Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Your name, sir, truly.\n  CINNA. Truly, my name is Cinna.\n  FIRST CITIZEN. Tear him to pieces, he\'s a conspirator.\n  CINNA. I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his\nbad\n    verses.\n  CINNA. I am not Cinna the conspirator.\n  FOURTH CITIZEN. It is no matter, his name\'s Cinna. Pluck but\nhis\n    name out of his heart, and turn him going.\n  THIRD CITIZEN. Tear him, tear him! Come, brands, ho,\nfirebrands. To\n    Brutus\', to Cassius\'; burn all. Some to Decius\' house, and\nsome \n    to Casca\'s, some to Ligarius\'. Away, go!             Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

Antony, Octavius, and Lepidus, seated at a\ntable.\n\n  ANTONY. These many then shall die, their names are prick\'d.\n  OCTAVIUS. Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?\n  LEPIDUS. I do consent-\n  OCTAVIUS. Prick him down, Antony.\n  LEPIDUS. Upon condition Publius shall not live,\n    Who is your sister\'s son, Mark Antony.\n  ANTONY. He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.\n    But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar\'s house,\n    Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine\n    How to cut off some charge in legacies.\n  LEPIDUS. What, shall I find you here?\n  OCTAVIUS. Or here, or at the Capitol.            Exit Lepidus.\n  ANTONY. This is a slight unmeritable man,\n    Meet to be sent on errands. Is it fit,\n    The three-fold world divided, he should stand\n    One of the three to share it?\n  OCTAVIUS. So you thought him,\n    And took his voice who should be prick\'d to die \n    In our black sentence and proscription.\n  ANTONY. Octavius, I have seen more days than you,\n    And though we lay these honors on this man\n    To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,\n    He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,\n    To groan and sweat under the business,\n    Either led or driven, as we point the way;\n    And having brought our treasure where we will,\n    Then take we down his load and turn him off,\n    Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears\n    And graze in commons.\n  OCTAVIUS. You may do your will,\n    But he\'s a tried and valiant soldier.\n  ANTONY. So is my horse, Octavius, and for that\n    I do appoint him store of provender.\n    It is a creature that I teach to fight,\n    To wind, to stop, to run directly on,\n    His corporal motion govern\'d by my spirit.\n    And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so:\n    He must be taught, and train\'d, and bid go forth; \n    A barren-spirited fellow, one that feeds\n    On objects, arts, and imitations,\n    Which, out of use and staled by other men,\n    Begin his fashion. Do not talk of him\n    But as a property. And now, Octavius,\n    Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius\n    Are levying powers; we must straight make head;\n    Therefore let our alliance be combined,\n    Our best friends made, our means stretch\'d;\n    And let us presently go sit in council,\n    How covert matters may be best disclosed,\n    And open perils surest answered.\n  OCTAVIUS. Let us do so, for we are at the stake,\n    And bay\'d about with many enemies;\n    And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,\n    Millions of mischiefs.                               Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nCamp near Sardis. Before Brutus\' tent. Drum.\n\nEnter Brutus, Lucilius, Lucius, and Soldiers; Titinius and\nPindarus meet them.\n\n  BRUTUS. Stand, ho!\n  LUCILIUS. Give the word, ho, and stand.\n  BRUTUS. What now, Lucilius, is Cassius near?\n  LUCILIUS. He is at hand, and Pindarus is come\n    To do you salutation from his master.\n  BRUTUS. He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,\n    In his own change, or by ill officers,\n    Hath given me some worthy cause to wish\n    Things done undone; but if he be at hand,\n    I shall be satisfied.\n  PINDARUS. I do not doubt\n    But that my noble master will appear\n    Such as he is, full of regard and honor.\n  BRUTUS. He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius,\n    How he received you. Let me be resolved.\n  LUCILIUS. With courtesy and with respect enough, \n    But not with such familiar instances,\n    Nor with such free and friendly conference,\n    As he hath used of old.\n  BRUTUS. Thou hast described\n    A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,\n    When love begins to sicken and decay\n    It useth an enforced ceremony.\n    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;\n    But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,\n    Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;\n    But when they should endure the bloody spur,\n    They fall their crests and like deceitful jades\n    Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?\n  LUCILIUS. They meant his night in Sard is to be quarter\'d;\n    The greater part, the horse in general,\n    Are come with Cassius.                     Low march within.\n  BRUTUS. Hark, he is arrived.\n    March gently on to meet him.\n\n                  Enter Cassius and his Powers. \n\n  CASSIUS. Stand, ho!\n  BRUTUS. Stand, ho! Speak the word along.\n  FIRST SOLDIER. Stand!\n  SECOND SOLDIER. Stand!\n  THIRD SOLDIER. Stand!\n  CASSIUS. Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.\n  BRUTUS. Judge me, you gods! Wrong I mine enemies?\n    And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs,\n    And when you do them-\n  BRUTUS. Cassius, be content,\n    Speak your griefs softly, I do know you well.\n    Before the eyes of both our armies here,\n    Which should perceive nothing but love from us,\n    Let us not wrangle. Bid them move away;\n    Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,\n    And I will give you audience.\n  CASSIUS. Pindarus,\n    Bid our commanders lead their charges off \n    A little from this ground.\n  BRUTUS. Lucilius, do you the like, and let no man\n    Come to our tent till we have done our conference.\n    Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.             Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nBrutus\' tent.\n\nEnter Brutus and Cassius.\n\n  CASSIUS. That you have wrong\'d me doth appear in this:\n    You have condemn\'d and noted Lucius Pella\n    For taking bribes here of the Sardians,\n    Wherein my letters, praying on his side,\n    Because I knew the man, were slighted off.\n  BRUTUS. You wrong\'d yourself to write in such a case.\n  CASSIUS. In such a time as this it is not meet\n    That every nice offense should bear his comment.\n  BRUTUS. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself\n    Are much condemn\'d to have an itching palm,\n    To sell and mart your offices for gold\n    To undeservers.\n  CASSIUS. I an itching palm?\n    You know that you are Brutus that speaks this,\n    Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\n  BRUTUS. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,\n    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head. \n  CASSIUS. Chastisement?\n  BRUTUS. Remember March, the ides of March remember.\n    Did not great Julius bleed for justice\' sake?\n    What villain touch\'d his body, that did stab,\n    And not for justice? What, shall one of us,\n    That struck the foremost man of all this world\n    But for supporting robbers, shall we now\n    Contaminate our fingers with base bribes\n    And sell the mighty space of our large honors\n    For so much trash as may be grasped thus?\n    I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,\n    Than such a Roman.\n  CASSIUS. Brutus, bait not me,\n    I\'ll not endure it. You forget yourself\n    To hedge me in. I am a soldier, I,\n    Older in practice, abler than yourself\n    To make conditions.\n  BRUTUS. Go to, you are not, Cassius.\n  CASSIUS. I am.\n  BRUTUS. I say you are not. \n  CASSIUS. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;\n    Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.\n  BRUTUS. Away, slight man!\n  CASSIUS. Is\'t possible?\n  BRUTUS. Hear me, for I will speak.\n    Must I give way and room to your rash choler?\n    Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?\n  CASSIUS. O gods, ye gods! Must I endure all this?\n  BRUTUS. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud heart break.\n    Go show your slaves how choleric you are,\n    And make your bondmen tremble. Must I bouge?\n    Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch\n    Under your testy humor? By the gods,\n    You shall digest the venom of your spleen,\n    Though it do split you, for, from this day forth,\n    I\'ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,\n    When you are waspish.\n  CASSIUS. Is it come to this?\n  BRUTUS. You say you are a better soldier:\n    Let it appear so, make your vaunting true, \n    And it shall please me well. For mine own part,\n    I shall be glad to learn of noble men.\n  CASSIUS. You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.\n    I said, an elder soldier, not a better.\n    Did I say "better"?\n  BRUTUS. If you did, I care not.\n  CASSIUS. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.\n  BRUTUS. Peace, peace! You durst not so have tempted him.\n  CASSIUS. I durst not?\n  BRUTUS. No.\n  CASSIUS. What, durst not tempt him?\n  BRUTUS. For your life you durst not.\n  CASSIUS. Do not presume too much upon my love;\n    I may do that I shall be sorry for.\n  BRUTUS. You have done that you should be sorry for.\n    There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,\n    For I am arm\'d so strong in honesty,\n    That they pass by me as the idle wind\n    Which I respect not. I did send to you\n    For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, \n    For I can raise no money by vile means.\n    By heaven, I had rather coin my heart\n    And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring\n    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\n    By any indirection. I did send\n    To you for gold to pay my legions,\n    Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius?\n    Should I have answer\'d Caius Cassius so?\n    When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous\n    To lock such rascal counters from his friends,\n    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,\n    Dash him to pieces!\n  CASSIUS. I denied you not.\n  BRUTUS. You did.\n  CASSIUS. I did not. He was but a fool\n    That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart.\n    A friend should bear his friend\'s infirmities,\n    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.\n  BRUTUS. I do not, till you practise them on me.\n  CASSIUS. You love me not. \n  BRUTUS. I do not like your faults.\n  CASSIUS. A friendly eye could never see such faults.\n  BRUTUS. A flatterer\'s would not, though they do appear\n    As huge as high Olympus.\n  CASSIUS. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\n    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\n    For Cassius is aweary of the world:\n    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;\n    Check\'d like a bondman; all his faults observed,\n    Set in a notebook, learn\'d and conn\'d by rote,\n    To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep\n    My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,\n    And here my naked breast; within, a heart\n    Dearer than Pluto\'s mine, richer than gold.\n    If that thou best a Roman, take it forth;\n    I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.\n    Strike, as thou didst at Caesar, for I know,\n    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better\n    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.\n  BRUTUS. Sheathe your dagger. \n    Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;\n    Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.\n    O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb,\n    That carries anger as the flint bears fire,\n    Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark\n    And straight is cold again.\n  CASSIUS. Hath Cassius lived\n    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,\n    When grief and blood ill-temper\'d vexeth him?\n  BRUTUS. When I spoke that, I was ill-temper\'d too.\n  CASSIUS. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.\n  BRUTUS. And my heart too.\n  CASSIUS. O Brutus!\n  BRUTUS. What\'s the matter?\n  CASSIUS. Have not you love enough to bear with me\n    When that rash humor which my mother gave me\n    Makes me forgetful?\n  BRUTUS. Yes, Cassius, and from henceforth,\n    When you are overearnest with your Brutus,\n    He\'ll think your mother chides, and leave you so. \n  POET. [Within.] Let me go in to see the generals.\n    There is some grudge between \'em, \'tis not meet\n    They be alone.\n  LUCILIUS. [Within.] You shall not come to them.\n  POET. [Within.] Nothing but death shall stay me.\n\n      Enter Poet, followed by Lucilius, Titinius, and Lucius.\n\n  CASSIUS. How now, what\'s the matter?\n  POET. For shame, you generals! What do you mean?\n    Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;\n    For I have seen more years, I\'m sure, than ye.\n  CASSIUS. Ha, ha! How vilely doth this cynic rhyme!\n  BRUTUS. Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!\n  CASSIUS. Bear with him, Brutus; \'tis his fashion.\n  BRUTUS. I\'ll know his humor when he knows his time.\n    What should the wars do with these jigging fools?\n    Companion, hence!\n  CASSIUS. Away, away, be gone!                       Exit Poet.\n  BRUTUS. Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders \n    Prepare to lodge their companies tonight.\n  CASSIUS. And come yourselves and bring Messala with you\n    Immediately to us.             Exeunt Lucilius and Titinius.\n  BRUTUS. Lucius, a bowl of wine!                   Exit Lucius.\n  CASSIUS. I did not think you could have been so angry.\n  BRUTUS. O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.\n  CASSIUS. Of your philosophy you make no use,\n    If you give place to accidental evils.\n  BRUTUS. No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.\n  CASSIUS. Ha? Portia?\n  BRUTUS. She is dead.\n  CASSIUS. How \'scaped killing when I cross\'d you so?\n    O insupportable and touching loss!\n    Upon what sickness?\n  BRUTUS. Impatient of my absence,\n    And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony\n    Have made themselves so strong- for with her death\n    That tidings came- with this she fell distract,\n    And (her attendants absent) swallow\'d fire.\n  CASSIUS. And died so? \n  BRUTUS. Even so.\n  CASSIUS. O ye immortal gods!\n\n               Re-enter Lucius, with wine and taper.\n\n  BRUTUS. Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.\n    In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.              Drinks.\n  CASSIUS. My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.\n  Fill, Lucius, till the wine o\'erswell the cup;\n  I cannot drink too much of Brutus\' love.               Drinks.\n  BRUTUS. Come in, Titinius!                        Exit Lucius.\n\n                 Re-enter Titinius, with Messala.\n\n    Welcome, good Messala.\n    Now sit we close about this taper here,\n    And call in question our necessities.\n  CASSIUS. Portia, art thou gone?\n  BRUTUS. No more, I pray you.\n    Messala, I have here received letters \n    That young Octavius and Mark Antony\n    Come down upon us with a mighty power,\n    Bending their expedition toward Philippi.\n  MESSALA. Myself have letters of the selfsame tenure.\n  BRUTUS. With what addition?\n  MESSALA. That by proscription and bills of outlawry\n    Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus\n    Have put to death an hundred senators.\n  BRUTUS. There in our letters do not well agree;\n    Mine speak of seventy senators that died\n    By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.\n  CASSIUS. Cicero one!\n  MESSALA. Cicero is dead,\n    And by that order of proscription.\n    Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?\n  BRUTUS. No, Messala.\n  MESSALA. Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?\n  BRUTUS. Nothing, Messala.\n  MESSALA. That, methinks, is strange.\n  BRUTUS. Why ask you? Hear you aught of her in yours? \n  MESSALA. No, my lord.\n  BRUTUS. Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.\n  MESSALA. Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:\n    For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.\n  BRUTUS. Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala.\n    With meditating that she must die once\n    I have the patience to endure it now.\n  MESSALA. Even so great men great losses should endure.\n  CASSIUS. I have as much of this in art as you,\n    But yet my nature could not bear it so.\n  BRUTUS. Well, to our work alive. What do you think\n    Of marching to Philippi presently?\n  CASSIUS. I do not think it good.\n  BRUTUS. Your reason?\n  CASSIUS. This it is:\n    \'Tis better that the enemy seek us;\n    So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,\n    Doing himself offense, whilst we lying still\n    Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.\n  BRUTUS. Good reasons must of force give place to better. \n    The people \'twixt Philippi and this ground\n    Do stand but in a forced affection,\n    For they have grudged us contribution.\n    The enemy, marching along by them,\n    By them shall make a fuller number up,\n    Come on refresh\'d, new-added, and encouraged;\n    From which advantage shall we cut him off\n    If at Philippi we do face him there,\n    These people at our back.\n  CASSIUS. Hear me, good brother.\n  BRUTUS. Under your pardon. You must note beside\n    That we have tried the utmost of our friends,\n    Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:\n    The enemy increaseth every day;\n    We, at the height, are ready to decline.\n    There is a tide in the affairs of men\n    Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune;\n    Omitted, all the voyage of their life\n    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.\n    On such a full sea are we now afloat, \n    And we must take the current when it serves,\n    Or lose our ventures.\n  CASSIUS. Then, with your will, go on;\n    We\'ll along ourselves and meet them at Philippi.\n  BRUTUS. The deep of night is crept upon our talk,\n    And nature must obey necessity,\n    Which we will niggard with a little rest.\n    There is no more to say?\n  CASSIUS. No more. Good night.\n    Early tomorrow will we rise and hence.\n  BRUTUS. Lucius!\n\n                       Re-enter Lucius.\n\n    My gown.                                        Exit Lucius.\n    Farewell, good Messala;\n    Good night, Titinius; noble, noble Cassius,\n    Good night and good repose.\n  CASSIUS. O my dear brother!\n    This was an ill beginning of the night. \n    Never come such division \'tween our souls!\n    Let it not, Brutus.\n  BRUTUS. Everything is well.\n  CASSIUS. Good night, my lord.\n  BRUTUS. Good night, good brother.\n  TITINIUS. MESSALA. Good night, Lord Brutus.\n  BRUTUS. Farewell, everyone.\n                                          Exeunt all but Brutus.\n\n               Re-enter Lucius, with the gown.\n\n    Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?\n  LUCIUS. Here in the tent.\n  BRUTUS. What, thou speak\'st drowsily?\n    Poor knave, I blame thee not, thou art o\'erwatch\'d.\n    Call Claudio and some other of my men,\n    I\'ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.\n  LUCIUS. Varro and Claudio!\n\n                   Enter Varro and Claudio. \n\n  VARRO. Calls my lord?\n  BRUTUS. I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;\n    It may be I shall raise you by and by\n    On business to my brother Cassius.\n  VARRO. So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.\n  BRUTUS. I would not have it so. Lie down, good sirs.\n    It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.\n    Look Lucius, here\'s the book I sought for so;\n    I put it in the pocket of my gown.\n                                     Varro and Claudio lie down.\n  LUCIUS. I was sure your lordship did not give it me.\n  BRUTUS. Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.\n    Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,\n    And touch thy instrument a strain or two?\n  LUCIUS. Ay, my lord, an\'t please you.\n  BRUTUS. It does, my boy.\n    I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.\n  LUCIUS. It is my duty, sir.\n  BRUTUS. I should not urge thy duty past thy might; \n    I know young bloods look for a time of rest.\n  LUCIUS. I have slept, my lord, already.\n  BRUTUS. It was well done, and thou shalt sleep again;\n    I will not hold thee long. If I do live,\n    I will be good to thee.                   Music, and a song.\n    This is a sleepy tune. O murtherous slumber,\n    Layest thou thy leaden mace upon my boy\n    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night.\n    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee.\n    If thou dost nod, thou break\'st thy instrument;\n    I\'ll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.\n    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn\'d down\n    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.        Sits down.\n\n                 Enter the Ghost of Caesar.\n\n    How ill this taper burns! Ha, who comes here?\n    I think it is the weakness of mine eyes\n    That shapes this monstrous apparition.\n    It comes upon me. Art thou anything? \n    Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil\n    That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?\n    Speak to me what thou art.\n  GHOST. Thy evil spirit, Brutus.\n  BRUTUS. Why comest thou?\n  GHOST. To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.\n  BRUTUS. Well, then I shall see thee again?\n  GHOST. Ay, at Philippi.\n  BRUTUS. Why, I will see thee at Philippi then.     Exit Ghost.\n    Now I have taken heart thou vanishest.\n    Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.\n    Boy! Lucius! Varro! Claudio! Sirs, awake!\n    Claudio!\n  LUCIUS. The strings, my lord, are false.\n  BRUTUS. He thinks he still is at his instrument.\n    Lucius, awake!\n  LUCIUS. My lord?\n  BRUTUS. Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?\n  LUCIUS. My lord, I do not know that I did cry.\n  BRUTUS. Yes, that thou didst. Didst thou see anything? \n  LUCIUS. Nothing, my lord.\n  BRUTUS. Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudio!\n    [To Varro.] Fellow thou, awake!\n  VARRO. My lord?\n  CLAUDIO. My lord?\n  BRUTUS. Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?\n  VARRO. CLAUDIO. Did we, my lord?\n  BRUTUS. Ay, saw you anything?\n  VARRO. No, my lord, I saw nothing.\n  CLAUDIO. Nor I, my lord.\n  BRUTUS. Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;\n    Bid him set on his powers betimes before,\n    And we will follow.\n  VARRO. CLAUDIO. It shall be done, my lord.             Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\n<<THIS ELECTRONIC VERSION OF THE COMPLETE WORKS OF WILLIAM\nSHAKESPEARE IS COPYRIGHT 1990-1993 BY WORLD LIBRARY, INC., AND IS\nPROVIDED BY PROJECT GUTENBERG ETEXT OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY\nWITH PERMISSION.

SCENE I.\nThe plains of Philippi.\n\nEnter Octavius, Antony, and their Army.\n\n  OCTAVIUS. Now, Antony, our hopes are answered.\n    You said the enemy would not come down,\n    But keep the hills and upper regions.\n    It proves not so. Their battles are at hand;\n    They mean to warn us at Philippi here,\n    Answering before we do demand of them.\n  ANTONY. Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know\n    Wherefore they do it. They could be content\n    To visit other places, and come down\n    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face\n    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;\n    But \'tis not so.\n\n                    Enter a Messenger.\n\n  MESSENGER. Prepare you, generals.\n    The enemy comes on in gallant show; \n    Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,\n    And something to be done immediately.\n  ANTONY. Octavius, lead your battle softly on,\n    Upon the left hand of the even field.\n  OCTAVIUS. Upon the right hand I, keep thou the left.\n  ANTONY. Why do you cross me in this exigent?\n  OCTAVIUS. I do not cross you, but I will do so.\n\n      March. Drum. Enter Brutus, Cassius, and their Army;\n           Lucilius, Titinius, Messala, and others.\n\n  BRUTUS. They stand, and would have parley.\n  CASSIUS. Stand fast, Titinius; we must out and talk.\n  OCTAVIUS. Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?\n  ANTONY. No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.\n    Make forth, the generals would have some words.\n  OCTAVIUS. Stir not until the signal not until the signal.\n  BRUTUS. Words before blows. Is it so, countrymen?\n  OCTAVIUS. Not that we love words better, as you do.\n  BRUTUS. Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius. \n  ANTONY. In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words.\n    Witness the hole you made in Caesar\'s heart,\n    Crying "Long live! Hail, Caesar!"\n  CASSIUS. Antony,\n    The posture of your blows are yet unknown;\n    But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,\n    And leave them honeyless.\n  ANTONY. Not stingless too.\n  BRUTUS. O, yes, and soundless too,\n    For you have stol\'n their buzzing, Antony,\n    And very wisely threat before you sting.\n  ANTONY. Villains! You did not so when your vile daggers\n    Hack\'d one another in the sides of Caesar.\n    You show\'d your teeth like apes, and fawn\'d like hounds,\n    And bow\'d like bondmen, kissing Caesar\'s feet;\n    Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind\n    Strooke Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!\n  CASSIUS. Flatterers? Now, Brutus, thank yourself.\n    This tongue had not offended so today,\n    If Cassius might have ruled. \n  OCTAVIUS. Come, come, the cause. If arguing make us sweat,\n    The proof of it will turn to redder drops.\n    Look,\n    I draw a sword against conspirators;\n    When think you that the sword goes up again?\n    Never, till Caesar\'s three and thirty wounds\n    Be well avenged, or till another Caesar\n    Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.\n  BRUTUS. Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors\' hands,\n    Unless thou bring\'st them with thee.\n  OCTAVIUS. So I hope,\n    I was not born to die on Brutus\' sword.\n  BRUTUS. O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,\n    Young man, thou couldst not die more honorable.\n  CASSIUS. A peevish school boy, worthless of such honor,\n    Join\'d with a masker and a reveler!\n  ANTONY. Old Cassius still!\n  OCTAVIUS. Come, Antony, away!\n    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth.\n    If you dare fight today, come to the field; \n    If not, when you have stomachs.\n                        Exeunt Octavius, Antony, and their Army.\n  CASSIUS. Why, now, blow and, swell billow, and swim bark!\n    The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.\n  BRUTUS. Ho, Lucilius! Hark, a word with you.\n  LUCILIUS. [Stands forth.] My lord?\n                             Brutus and Lucilius converse apart.\n  CASSIUS. Messala!\n  MESSALA. [Stands forth.] What says my general?\n  CASSIUS. Messala,\n    This is my birthday, as this very day\n    Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala.\n    Be thou my witness that, against my will,\n    As Pompey was, am I compell\'d to set\n    Upon one battle all our liberties.\n    You know that I held Epicurus strong,\n    And his opinion. Now I change my mind,\n    And partly credit things that do presage.\n    Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign\n    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch\'d, \n    Gorging and feeding from our soldiers\' hands,\n    Who to Philippi here consorted us.\n    This morning are they fled away and gone,\n    And in their steads do ravens, crows, and kites\n    Fly o\'er our heads and downward look on us,\n    As we were sickly prey. Their shadows seem\n    A canopy most fatal, under which\n    Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.\n  MESSALA. Believe not so.\n  CASSIUS. I but believe it partly,\n    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved\n    To meet all perils very constantly.\n  BRUTUS. Even so, Lucilius.\n  CASSIUS. Now, most noble Brutus,\n    The gods today stand friendly that we may,\n    Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!\n    But, since the affairs of men rest still incertain,\n    Let\'s reason with the worst that may befall.\n    If we do lose this battle, then is this\n    The very last time we shall speak together. \n    What are you then determined to do?\n  BRUTUS. Even by the rule of that philosophy\n    By which I did blame Cato for the death\n    Which he did give himself- I know not how,\n    But I do find it cowardly and vile,\n    For fear of what might fall, so to prevent\n    The time of life- arming myself with patience\n    To stay the providence of some high powers\n    That govern us below.\n  CASSIUS. Then, if we lose this battle,\n    You are contented to be led in triumph\n    Thorough the streets of Rome?\n  BRUTUS. No, Cassius, no. Think not, thou noble Roman,\n    That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;\n    He bears too great a mind. But this same day\n    Must end that work the ides of March begun.\n    And whether we shall meet again I know not.\n    Therefore our everlasting farewell take.\n    Forever, and forever, farewell, Cassius!\n    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile; \n    If not, why then this parting was well made.\n  CASSIUS. Forever and forever farewell, Brutus!\n    If we do meet again, we\'ll smile indeed;\n    If not, \'tis true this parting was well made.\n  BRUTUS. Why then, lead on. O, that a man might know\n    The end of this day\'s business ere it come!\n    But it sufficeth that the day will end,\n    And then the end is known. Come, ho! Away!           Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE II.\nThe field of battle.\n\nAlarum. Enter Brutus and Messala.\n\n  BRUTUS. Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills\n    Unto the legions on the other side.             Loud alarum.\n    Let them set on at once, for I perceive\n    But cold demeanor in Octavia\'s wing,\n    And sudden push gives them the overthrow.\n    Ride, ride, Messala. Let them all come down.         Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE III.\nAnother part of the field.\n\nAlarums. Enter Cassius and Titinius.\n\n  CASSIUS. O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!\n    Myself have to mine own turn\'d enemy.\n    This ensign here of mine was turning back;\n    I slew the coward, and did take it from him.\n  TITINIUS. O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early,\n    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,\n    Took it too eagerly. His soldiers fell to spoil,\n    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.\n\n                       Enter Pindarus.\n\n  PINDARUS. Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;\n    Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord;\n    Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.\n  CASSIUS. This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius:\n    Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?\n  TITINIUS. They are, my lord. \n  CASSIUS. Titinius, if thou lovest me,\n    Mount thou my horse and hide thy spurs in him,\n    Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops\n    And here again, that I may rest assured\n    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.\n  TITINIUS. I will be here again, even with a thought.     Exit.\n  CASSIUS. Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;\n    My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,\n    And tell me what thou notest about the field.\n                                      Pindarus ascends the hill.\n    This day I breathed first: time is come round,\n    And where I did begin, there shall I end;\n    My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?\n  PINDARUS. [Above.] O my lord!\n  CASSIUS. What news?\n  PINDARUS. [Above.] Titinius is enclosed round about\n    With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;\n    Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.\n    Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.\n    He\'s ta\'en [Shout.] And, hark! They shout for joy. \n  CASSIUS. Come down; behold no more.\n    O, coward that I am, to live so long,\n    To see my best friend ta\'en before my face!\n                                              Pindarus descends.\n    Come hither, sirrah.\n    In Parthia did I take thee prisoner,\n    And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,\n    That whatsoever I did bid thee do,\n    Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;\n    Now be a freeman, and with this good sword,\n    That ran through Caesar\'s bowels, search this bosom.\n    Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;\n    And when my face is cover\'d, as \'tis now,\n    Guide thou the sword. [Pindarus stabs him.] Caesar, thou art\n      revenged,\n    Even with the sword that kill\'d thee.                  Dies.\n  PINDARUS. So, I am free, yet would not so have been,\n    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius!\n    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,\n    Where never Roman shall take note of him.              Exit. \n\n                Re-enter Titinius with Messala.\n\n  MESSALA. It is but change, Titinius, for Octavius\n    Is overthrown by noble Brutus\' power,\n    As Cassius\' legions are by Antony.\n  TITINIUS. These tidings would well comfort Cassius.\n  MESSALA. Where did you leave him?\n  TITINIUS. All disconsolate,\n    With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.\n  MESSALA. Is not that he that lies upon the ground?\n  TITINIUS. He lies not like the living. O my heart!\n  MESSALA. Is not that he?\n  TITINIUS. No, this was he, Messala,\n    But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,\n    As in thy red rays thou dost sink to night,\n    So in his red blood Cassius\' day is set,\n    The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;\n    Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!\n    Mistrust of my success hath done this deed. \n  MESSALA. Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.\n    O hateful error, melancholy\'s child,\n    Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men\n    The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,\n    Thou never comest unto a happy birth,\n    But kill\'st the mother that engender\'d thee!\n  TITINIUS. What, Pindarus! Where art thou, Pindarus?\n  MESSALA. Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet\n    The noble Brutus, thrusting this report\n    Into his ears. I may say "thrusting" it,\n    For piercing steel and darts envenomed\n    Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus\n    As tidings of this sight.\n  TITINIUS. Hie you, Messala,\n    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.        Exit Messala.\n    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?\n    Did I not meet thy friends? And did not they\n    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,\n    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?\n    Alas, thou hast misconstrued everything! \n    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;\n    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I\n    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,\n    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.\n    By your leave, gods, this is a Roman\'s part.\n    Come, Cassius\' sword, and find Titinius\' heart.\n                                                  Kills himself.\n\n       Alarum. Re-enter Messala, with Brutus, young Cato,\n                         and others.\n\n  BRUTUS. Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?\n  MESSALA. Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.\n  BRUTUS. Titinius\' face is upward.\n  CATO. He is slain.\n  BRUTUS. O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!\n    Thy spirit walks abroad, and turns our swords\n    In our own proper entrails.                     Low alarums.\n  CATO. Brave Titinius!\n    Look whe\'er he have not crown\'d dead Cassius! \n  BRUTUS. Are yet two Romans living such as these?\n    The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!\n    It is impossible that ever Rome\n    Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe moe tears\n    To this dead man than you shall see me pay.\n    I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.\n    Come therefore, and to Thasos send his body;\n    His funerals shall not be in our camp,\n    Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come,\n    And come, young Cato; let us to the field.\n    Labio and Flavio, set our battles on.\n    \'Tis three o\'clock, and Romans, yet ere night\n    We shall try fortune in a second fight.              Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE IV.\nAnother part of the field.\n\nAlarum. Enter, fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then Brutus,\nyoung Cato,\nLucilius, and others.\n\n  BRUTUS. Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!\n  CATO. What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?\n    I will proclaim my name about the field.\n    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\n    A foe to tyrants, and my country\'s friend.\n    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!\n  BRUTUS. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;\n    Brutus, my country\'s friend; know me for Brutus!       Exit.\n  LUCILIUS. O young and noble Cato, art thou down?\n    Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius,\n    And mayst be honor\'d, being Cato\'s son.\n  FIRST SOLDIER. Yield, or thou diest.\n  LUCILIUS. Only I yield to die.\n    [Offers money.] There is so much that thou wilt kill me\nstraight:\n    Kill Brutus, and be honor\'d in his death.\n  FIRST SOLDIER. We must not. A noble prisoner! \n  SECOND SOLDIER. Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta\'en.\n  FIRST SOLDIER. I\'ll tell the news. Here comes the general.\n\n                         Enter Antony.\n\n    Brutus is ta\'en, Brutus is ta\'en, my lord.\n  ANTONY. Where is he?\n  LUCILIUS. Safe, Antony, Brutus is safe enough.\n    I dare assure thee that no enemy\n    Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus;\n    The gods defend him from so great a shame!\n    When you do find him, or alive or dead,\n    He will be found like Brutus, like himself.\n  ANTONY. This is not Brutus, friend, but, I assure you,\n    A prize no less in worth. Keep this man safe,\n    Give him all kindness; I had rather have\n    Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,\n    And see wheer Brutus be alive or dead,\n    And bring us word unto Octavius\' tent\n    How everything is chanced.                           Exeunt.\n\n\n\n\nSCENE V.\nAnother part of the field.\n\nEnter Brutus, Dardanius, Clitus, Strato, and Volumnius.\n\n  BRUTUS. Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.\n  CLITUS. Statilius show\'d the torchlight, but, my lord,\n    He came not back. He is or ta\'en or slain.\n  BRUTUS. Sit thee down, Clitus. Slaying is the word:\n    It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.        Whispers.\n  CLITUS. What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.\n  BRUTUS. Peace then, no words.\n  CLITUS. I\'ll rather kill myself.\n  BRUTUS. Hark thee, Dardanius.                        Whispers.\n  DARDANIUS. Shall I do such a deed?\n  CLITUS. O Dardanius!\n  DARDANIUS. O Clitus!\n  CLITUS. What ill request did Brutus make to thee?\n  DARDANIUS. To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.\n  CLITUS. Now is that noble vessel full of grief,\n    That it runs over even at his eyes.\n  BRUTUS. Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word. \n  VOLUMNIUS. What says my lord?\n  BRUTUS. Why, this, Volumnius:\n    The ghost of Caesar hath appear\'d to me\n    Two several times by night; at Sardis once,\n    And this last night here in Philippi fields.\n    I know my hour is come.\n  VOLUMNIUS. Not so, my lord.\n  BRUTUS. Nay I am sure it is, Volumnius.\n    Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;\n    Our enemies have beat us to the pit;            Low alarums.\n    It is more worthy to leap in ourselves\n    Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,\n    Thou know\'st that we two went to school together;\n    Even for that our love of old, I prithee,\n    Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.\n  VOLUMNIUS. That\'s not an office for a friend, my lord.\n                                                   Alarum still.\n  CLITUS. Fly, fly, my lord, there is no tarrying here.\n  BRUTUS. Farewell to you, and you, and you, Volumnius.\n    Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep; \n    Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,\n    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life\n    I found no man but he was true to me.\n    I shall have glory by this losing day,\n    More than Octavius and Mark Antony\n    By this vile conquest shall attain unto.\n    So, fare you well at once, for Brutus\' tongue\n    Hath almost ended his life\'s history.\n    Night hangs upon mine eyes, my bones would rest\n    That have but labor\'d to attain this hour.\n                            Alarum. Cry within, "Fly, fly, fly!"\n  CLITUS. Fly, my lord, fly.\n  BRUTUS. Hence! I will follow.\n                        Exeunt Clitus, Dardanius, and Volumnius.\n    I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord.\n    Thou art a fellow of a good respect;\n    Thy life hath had some smatch of honor in it.\n    Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,\n    While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?\n  STRATO. Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord. \n  BRUTUS. Farewell, good Strato.              Runs on his sword.\n    Caesar, now be still;\n    I kill\'d not thee with half so good a will.            Dies.\n\n     Alarum. Retreat. Enter Octavius, Antony, Messala,\n                 Lucilius, and the Army.\n\n  OCTAVIUS. What man is that?\n  MESSALA. My master\'s man. Strato, where is thy master?\n  STRATO. Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:\n    The conquerors can but make a fire of him;\n    For Brutus only overcame himself,\n    And no man else hath honor by his death.\n  LUCILIUS. So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,\n    That thou hast proved Lucilius\' saying true.\n  OCTAVIUS. All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.\n    Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?\n  STRATO. Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.\n  OCTAVIUS. Do so, good Messala.\n  MESSALA. How died my master, Strato? \n  STRATO. I held the sword, and he did run on it.\n  MESSALA. Octavius, then take him to follow thee\n    That did the latest service to my master.\n  ANTONY. This was the noblest Roman of them all.\n    All the conspirators, save only he,\n    Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;\n    He only, in a general honest thought\n    And common good to all, made one of them.\n    His life was gentle, and the elements\n    So mix\'d in him that Nature might stand up\n    And say to all the world, "This was a man!"\n  OCTAVIUS. According to his virtue let us use him\n    With all respect and rites of burial.\n    Within my tent his bones tonight shall lie,\n    Most like a soldier, ordered honorably.\n    So call the field to rest, and let\'s away,\n    To part the glories of this happy day.              Exeunt.\n\n\nTHE END\n\n'

An open place._\n\n  _Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS._\n\n_Val._ Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:\nHome-keeping youth have ever homely wits.\nWere't not affection chains thy tender days\nTo the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,\nI rather would entreat thy company                                   5\nTo see the wonders of the world abroad,\nThan, living dully sluggardized at home,\nWear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.\nBut since thou lovest, love still, and thrive therein,\nEven as I would, when I to love begin.                              10\n\n_Pro._ Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!\nThink on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest\nSome rare note-worthy object in thy travel:\nWish me partaker in thy happiness,\nWhen thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,                    15\nIf ever danger do environ thee,\nCommend thy grievance to my holy prayers,\nFor I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.\n\n_Val._ And on a love-book pray for my success?\n\n_Pro._ Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.                    20\n\n_Val._ That's on some shallow story of deep love:\nHow young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.\n\n_Pro._ That's a deep story of a deeper love;\nFor he was more than over shoes in love.\n\n_Val._ 'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,                   25\nAnd yet you never swum the Hellespont.\n\n_Pro._ Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.\n\n_Val._ No, I will not, for it boots thee not.\n\n_Pro._                                      What?\n\n_Val._ To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;\nCoy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth          30\nWith twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:\nIf haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;\nIf lost, why then a grievous labour won;\nHowever, but a folly bought with wit,\nOr else a wit by folly vanquished.                                  35\n\n_Pro._ So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.\n\n_Val._ So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.\n\n_Pro._ 'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.\n\n_Val._ Love is your master, for he masters you:\nAnd he that is so yoked by a fool,                                  40\nMethinks, should not be chronicled for wise.\n\n_Pro._ Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud\nThe eating canker dwells, so eating love\nInhabits in the finest wits of all.\n\n_Val._ And writers say, as the most forward bud                     45\nIs eaten by the canker ere it blow,\nEven so by love the young and tender wit\nIs turn'd to folly; blasting in the bud,\nLosing his verdure even in the prime,\nAnd all the fair effects of future hopes.                           50\nBut wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,\nThat art a votary to fond desire?\nOnce more adieu! my father at the road\nExpects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.\n\n_Pro._ And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.                    55\n\n_Val._ Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.\nTo Milan let me hear from thee by letters\nOf thy success in love, and what news else\nBetideth here in absence of thy friend;\nAnd I likewise will visit thee with mine.                           60\n\n_Pro._ All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!\n\n_Val._ As much to you at home! and so, farewell.    [_Exit._\n\n_Pro._ He after honour hunts, I after love:\nHe leaves his friends to dignify them more;\nI leave myself, my friends, and all, for love.                      65\nThou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,\nMade me neglect my studies, lose my time,\nWar with good counsel, set the world at nought;\nMade wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.\n\n  _Enter SPEED._\n\n_Speed._ Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?                  70\n\n_Pro._ But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.\n\n_Speed._ Twenty to one, then, he is shipp'd already,\nAnd I have play'd the sheep in losing him.\n\n_Pro._ Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,\nAn if the shepherd be awhile away.                                  75\n\n_Speed._ You conclude that my master is a shepherd,\nthen, and I a sheep?\n\n_Pro._ I do.\n\n_Speed._ Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I\nwake or sleep.                                                      80\n\n_Pro._ A silly answer, and fitting well a sheep.\n\n_Speed._ This proves me still a sheep.\n\n_Pro._ True; and thy master a shepherd.\n\n_Speed._ Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.\n\n_Pro._ It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.               85\n\n_Speed._ The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep\nthe shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks\nnot me: therefore I am no sheep.\n\n_Pro._ The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the\nshepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for wages             90\nfollowest thy master; thy master for wages follows not\nthee: therefore thou art a sheep.\n\n_Speed._ Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'\n\n_Pro._ But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to\nJulia?                                                              95\n\n_Speed._ Ay, sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,\na laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a lost\nmutton, nothing for my labour.\n\n_Pro._ Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.\n\n_Speed._ If the ground be overcharged, you were best               100\nstick her.\n\n_Pro._ Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.\n\n_Speed._ Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for\ncarrying your letter.\n\n_Pro._ You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.                  105\n\n_Speed._ From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,\n'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover.\n\n_Pro._ But what said she?\n\n_Speed._ [_First nodding_] Ay.\n\n_Pro._ Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.                                 110\n\n_Speed._ You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you\nask me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'\n\n_Pro._ And that set together is noddy.\n\n_Speed._ Now you have taken the pains to set it together,\ntake it for your pains.                                            115\n\n_Pro._ No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.\n\n_Speed._ Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.\n\n_Pro._ Why, sir, how do you bear with me?\n\n_Speed._ Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing\nbut the word 'noddy' for my pains.                                 120\n\n_Pro._ Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.\n\n_Speed._ And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.\n\n_Pro._ Come, come, open the matter in brief: what said\nshe?\n\n_Speed._ Open your purse, that the money and the matter            125\nmay be both at once delivered.\n\n_Pro._ Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?\n\n_Speed._ Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.\n\n_Pro._ Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?\n\n_Speed._ Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her;            130\nno, not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter: and\nbeing so hard to me that brought your mind, I fear she'll\nprove as hard to you in telling your mind. Give her no\ntoken but stones; for she's as hard as steel.\n\n_Pro._ What said she? nothing?                                     135\n\n_Speed._ No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.'\nTo testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned\nme; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your letters yourself:\nand so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.\n\n_Pro._ Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,              140\nWhich cannot perish having thee aboard,\nBeing destined to a drier death on shore.    [_Exit Speed._\nI must go send some better messenger:\nI fear my Julia would not deign my lines,\nReceiving them from such a worthless post.

[_Exit._\n\n_Jul._ And yet I would I had o'erlook'd the letter:                 50\nIt were a shame to call her back again,\nAnd pray her to a fault for which I chid her.\nWhat a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,\nAnd would not force the letter to my view!\nSince maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that                           55\nWhich they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'\nFie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love,\nThat, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse,\nAnd presently, all humbled, kiss the rod!\nHow churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,                                60\nWhen willingly I would have had her here!\nHow angerly I taught my brow to frown,\nWhen inward joy enforced my heart to smile!\nMy penance is, to call Lucetta back,\nAnd ask remission for my folly past.                                65\nWhat, ho! Lucetta!\n\n  _Re-enter LUCETTA._\n\n_Luc._           What would your ladyship?\n\n_Jul._ Is't near dinner-time?\n\n_Luc._                      I would it were;\nThat you might kill your stomach on your meat,\nAnd not upon your maid.\n\n_Jul._ What is't that you took up so gingerly?                      70\n\n_Luc._ Nothing.\n\n_Jul._ Why didst thou stoop, then?\n\n_Luc._ To take a paper up that I let fall.\n\n_Jul._ And is that paper nothing?\n\n_Luc._ Nothing concerning me.                                       75\n\n_Jul._ Then let it lie for those that it concerns.\n\n_Luc._ Madam, it will not lie where it concerns,\nUnless it have a false interpreter.\n\n_Jul._ Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.\n\n_Luc._ That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.                      80\nGive me a note: your ladyship can set.\n\n_Jul._ --As little by such toys as may be possible.\nBest sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'\n\n_Luc._ It is too heavy for so light a tune.\n\n_Jul._ Heavy! belike it hath some burden, then?                     85\n\n_Luc._ Ay; and melodious were it, would you sing it.\n\n_Jul._ And why not you?\n\n_Luc._                I cannot reach so high.\n\n_Jul._ Let's see your song. How now, minion!\n\n_Luc._ Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:\nAnd yet methinks I do not like this tune.                           90\n\n_Jul._ You do not?\n\n_Luc._           No, madam; it is too sharp.\n\n_Jul._ You, minion, are too saucy.\n\n_Luc._ Nay, now you are too flat,\nAnd mar the concord with too harsh a descant:\nThere wanteth but a mean to fill your song.                         95\n\n_Jul._ The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.\n\n_Luc._ Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.\n\n_Jul._ This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.\nHere is a coil with protestation!     [_Tears the letter._\nGo get you gone, and let the papers lie:                           100\nYou would be fingering them, to anger me.\n\n_Luc._ She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased\nTo be so anger'd with another letter.

Madam Silvia!\n\n_Val._ How now, sirrah?\n\n_Speed._ She is not within hearing, sir.\n\n_Val._ Why, sir, who bade you call her?\n\n_Speed._ Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.                      10\n\n_Val._ Well, you'll still be too forward.\n\n_Speed._ And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.\n\n_Val._ Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?\n\n_Speed._ She that your worship loves?\n\n_Val._ Why, how know you that I am in love?                         15\n\n_Speed._ Marry, by these special marks: first, you have\nlearned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, like a malecontent;\nto relish a love-song, like a robin-redbreast; to\nwalk alone, like one that had the pestilence; to sigh, like a\nschool-boy that had lost his A B C; to weep, like a young           20\nwench that had buried her grandam; to fast, like one that\ntakes diet; to watch, like one that fears robbing; to speak\npuling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were wont, when\nyou laughed, to crow like a cock; when you walked, to walk\nlike one of the lions; when you fasted, it was presently after      25\ndinner; when you looked sadly, it was for want of money:\nand now you are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when\nI look on you, I can hardly think you my master.\n\n_Val._ Are all these things perceived in me?\n\n_Speed._ They are all perceived without ye.                         30\n\n_Val._ Without me? they cannot.\n\n_Speed._ Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without\nyou were so simple, none else would: but you are so without\nthese follies, that these follies are within you, and shine\nthrough you like the water in an urinal, that not an eye that       35\nsees you but is a physician to comment on your malady.\n\n_Val._ But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?\n\n_Speed._ She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?\n\n_Val._ Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.\n\n_Speed._ Why, sir, I know her not.                                  40\n\n_Val._ Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and\nyet knowest her not?\n\n_Speed._ Is she not hard-favoured, sir?\n\n_Val._ Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.\n\n_Speed._ Sir, I know that well enough.                              45\n\n_Val._ What dost thou know?\n\n_Speed._ That she is not so fair as, of you, well favoured.\n\n_Val._ I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her\nfavour infinite.\n\n_Speed._ That's because the one is painted, and the other           50\nout of all count.\n\n_Val._ How painted? and how out of count?\n\n_Speed._ Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no\nman counts of her beauty.\n\n_Val._ How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.              55\n\n_Speed._ You never saw her since she was deformed.\n\n_Val._ How long hath she been deformed?\n\n_Speed._ Ever since you loved her.\n\n_Val._ I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I\nsee her beautiful.                                                  60\n\n_Speed._ If you love her, you cannot see her.\n\n_Val._ Why?\n\n_Speed._ Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine\neyes; or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to\nhave when you chid at Sir Proteus for going ungartered!             65\n\n_Val._ What should I see then?\n\n_Speed._ Your own present folly, and her passing deformity:\nfor he, being in love, could not see to garter his\nhose; and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.\n\n_Val._ Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last morning         70\nyou could not see to wipe my shoes.\n\n_Speed._ True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank\nyou, you swinged me for my love, which makes me the\nbolder to chide you for yours.\n\n_Val._ In conclusion, I stand affected to her.                      75\n\n_Speed._ I would you were set, so your affection would\ncease.\n\n_Val._ Last night she enjoined me to write some lines\nto one she loves.\n\n_Speed._ And have you?                                              80\n\n_Val._ I have.\n\n_Speed._ Are they not lamely writ?\n\n_Val._ No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!\nhere she comes.\n\n_Speed._ [_Aside_] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!          85\nNow will he interpret to her.\n\n\n  _Enter SILVIA._\n\n_Val._ Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.\n\n_Speed._ [_Aside_] O, give ye good even! here's a million\nof manners.\n\n_Sil._ Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.              90\n\n_Speed._ [_Aside_] He should give her interest, and she\ngives it him.\n\n_Val._ As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter\nUnto the secret nameless friend of yours;\nWhich I was much unwilling to proceed in,                           95\nBut for my duty to your ladyship.\n\n_Sil._ I thank you, gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.\n\n_Val._ Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;\nFor, being ignorant to whom it goes,\nI writ at random, very doubtfully.                                 100\n\n_Sil._ Perchance you think too much of so much pains?\n\n_Val._ No, madam; so it stead you, I will write,\nPlease you command, a thousand times as much;\nAnd yet--\n\n_Sil._ A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;                  105\nAnd yet I will not name it;--and yet I care not;--\nAnd yet take this again:--and yet I thank you;\nMeaning henceforth to trouble you no more.\n\n_Speed._ [_Aside_] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'\n\n_Val._ What means your ladyship? do you not like it?               110\n\n_Sil._ Yes, yes: the lines are very quaintly writ;\nBut since unwillingly, take them again.\nNay, take them.\n\n_Val._ Madam, they are for you.\n\n_Sil._ Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;                  115\nBut I will none of them; they are for you;\nI would have had them writ more movingly.\n\n_Val._ Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.\n\n_Sil._ And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,\nAnd if it please you, so; if not, why, so.                         120\n\n_Val._ If it please me, madam, what then?\n\n_Sil._ Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:\nAnd so, good morrow, servant.    [_Exit._\n\n_Speed._ O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,\nAs a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!          125\nMy master sues to her; and she hath taught her suitor,\nHe being her pupil, to become her tutor.\nO excellent device! was there ever heard a better,\nThat my master, being scribe, to himself should write the letter?\n\n_Val._ How now, sir? what are you reasoning with                   130\nyourself?\n\n_Speed._ Nay. I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.\n\n_Val._ To do what?\n\n_Speed._ To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.                       135\n\n_Val._ To whom?\n\n_Speed._ To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.\n\n_Val._ What figure?\n\n_Speed._ By a letter, I should say.\n\n_Val._ Why, she hath not writ to me?                               140\n\n_Speed._ What need she, when she hath made you write\nto yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?\n\n_Val._ No, believe me.\n\n_Speed._ No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive\nher earnest?                                                       145\n\n_Val._ She gave me none, except an angry word.\n\n_Speed._ Why, she hath given you a letter.\n\n_Val._ That's the letter I writ to her friend.\n\n_Speed._ And that letter hath she delivered, and there\nan end.                                                            150\n\n_Val._ I would it were no worse.\n\n_Speed._ I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:\nFor often have you writ to her; and she, in modesty,\nOr else for want of idle time, could not again reply;\nOr fearing else some messenger, that might her mind discover,      155\nHerself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.\nAll this I speak in print, for in print I found it. Why muse\nyou, sir? 'tis dinner-time.\n\n_Val._ I have dined.\n\n_Speed._ Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon                160\nLove can feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by\nmy victuals, and would fain have meat.

I have\nreceived my proportion, like the prodigious son, and am\ngoing with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's court. I think Crab\nmy dog be the sourest-natured dog that lives: my mother              5\nweeping, my father wailing, my sister crying, our maid\nhowling, our cat wringing her hands, and all our house in a\ngreat perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed one\ntear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and has no more\npity in him than a dog: a Jew would have wept to have               10\nseen our parting; why, my grandam, having no eyes, look\nyou, wept herself blind at my parting. Nay, I'll shew you\nthe manner of it. This shoe is my father: no, this left shoe\nis my father: no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that\ncannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it hath the worser   15\nsole. This shoe, with the hole in it, is my mother, and this\nmy father; a vengeance on't! there 'tis: now, sir, this staff is\nmy sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily, and as\nsmall as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I am the dog:\nno, the dog is himself, and I am the dog,--Oh! the dog is           20\nme, and I am myself; ay, so, so. Now come I to my\nfather; Father, your blessing: now should not the shoe\nspeak a word for weeping: now should I kiss my father;\nwell, he weeps on. Now come I to my mother: O, that\nshe could speak now like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her;            25\nwhy, there 'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down.\nNow come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now\nthe dog all this while sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word;\nbut see how I lay the dust with my tears.\n\n  _Enter PANTHINO._\n\n_Pan._ Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped,           30\nand thou art to post after with oars. What's the matter?\nwhy weepest thou, man? Away, ass! you'll lose the\ntide, if you tarry any longer.\n\n_Launce._ It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is\nthe unkindest tied that ever any man tied.                          35\n\n_Pan._ What's the unkindest tide?\n\n_Launce._ Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.\n\n_Pan._ Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood: and, in\nlosing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing thy voyage,\nlose thy master, and, in losing thy master, lose thy service,       40\nand, in losing thy service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?\n\n_Launce._ For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.\n\n_Pan._ Where should I lose my tongue?\n\n_Launce._ In thy tale.\n\n_Pan._ In thy tail!                                                 45\n\n_Launce._ Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master,\nand the service, and the tied!

I understand thee not.\n\n_Launce._ What a block art thou, that thou canst not!\nMy staff understands me.\n\n_Speed._ What thou sayest?\n\n_Launce._ Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but                25\nlean, and my staff understands me.\n\n_Speed._ It stands under thee, indeed.\n\n_Launce._ Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.\n\n_Speed._ But tell me true, will't be a match?\n\n_Launce._ Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will; if he say,             30\nno, it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.\n\n_Speed._ The conclusion is, then, that it will.\n\n_Launce._ Thou shalt never get such a secret from me\nbut by a parable.\n\n_Speed._ 'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how               35\nsayest thou, that my master is become a notable lover?\n\n_Launce._ I never knew him otherwise.\n\n_Speed._ Than how?\n\n_Launce._ A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.\n\n_Speed._ Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.                 40\n\n_Launce._ Why fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.\n\n_Speed._ I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.\n\n_Launce._ Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn\nhimself in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;\nif not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the name           45\nof a Christian.\n\n_Speed._ Why?\n\n_Launce._ Because thou hast not so much charity in thee\nas to go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?\n\n_Speed._ At thy service.    [_Exeunt._                              50\n\n\n  Notes: II, 5.\n\n  SCENE V.] SCENA QUINTA F1. SCENA QUARTA F2 F3 F4. SCENE VIII.

[_Exit Thu._\nNow, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?\n\n_Pro._ My gracious lord, that which I would discover\nThe law of friendship bids me to conceal;                            5\nBut when I call to mind your gracious favours\nDone to me, undeserving as I am,\nMy duty pricks me on to utter that\nWhich else no worldly good should draw from me.\nKnow, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,                      10\nThis night intends to steal away your daughter:\nMyself am one made privy to the plot.\nI know you have determined to bestow her\nOn Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;\nAnd should she thus be stol'n away from you,                        15\nIt would be much vexation to your age.\nThus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose\nTo cross my friend in his intended drift\nThan, by concealing it, heap on your head\nA pack of sorrows, which would press you down,                      20\nBeing unprevented, to your timeless grave.\n\n_Duke._ Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;\nWhich to requite, command me while I live.\nThis love of theirs myself have often seen,\nHaply when they have judged me fast asleep;                         25\nAnd oftentimes have purposed to forbid\nSir Valentine her company and my court:\nBut, fearing lest my jealous aim might err,\nAnd so, unworthily disgrace the man,\nA rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,                            30\nI gave him gentle looks; thereby to find\nThat which thyself hast now disclosed to me.\nAnd, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,\nKnowing that tender youth is soon suggested,\nI nightly lodge her in an upper tower,                              35\nThe key whereof myself have ever kept;\nAnd thence she cannot be convey'd away.\n\n_Pro._ Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean\nHow he her chamber-window will ascend,\nAnd with a corded ladder fetch her down;                            40\nFor which the youthful lover now is gone,\nAnd this way comes he with it presently;\nWhere, if it please you, you may intercept him.\nBut, good my Lord, do it so cunningly\nThat my discovery be not aimed at;                                  45\nFor, love of you, not hate unto my friend,\nHath made me publisher of this pretence.\n\n_Duke._ Upon mine honour, he shall never know\nThat I had any light from thee of this.\n\n_Pro._ Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.    [_Exit._         50\n\n  _Enter VALENTINE._\n\n_Duke._ Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?\n\n_Val._ Please it your grace, there is a messenger\nThat stays to bear my letters to my friends,\nAnd I am going to deliver them.\n\n_Duke._ Be they of much import?                                     55\n\n_Val._ The tenour of them doth but signify\nMy health and happy being at your court.\n\n_Duke._ Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;\nI am to break with thee of some affairs\nThat touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.                    60\n'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought\nTo match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.\n\n_Val._ I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match\nWere rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman\nIs full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities                      65\nBeseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:\nCannot your Grace win her to fancy him?\n\n_Duke._ No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,\nProud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty;\nNeither regarding that she is my child,                             70\nNor fearing me as if I were her father:\nAnd, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,\nUpon advice, hath drawn my love from her;\nAnd, where I thought the remnant of mine age\nShould have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,                  75\nI now am full resolved to take a wife,\nAnd turn her out to who will take her in:\nThen let her beauty be her wedding-dower;\nFor me and my possessions she esteems not.\n\n_Val._ What would your Grace have me to do in this?                 80\n\n_Duke._ There is a lady in Verona here\nWhom I affect; but she is nice and coy,\nAnd nought esteems my aged eloquence:\nNow, therefore, would I have thee to my tutor,--\nFor long agone I have forgot to court;                              85\nBesides, the fashion of the time is changed,--\nHow and which way I may bestow myself,\nTo be regarded in her sun-bright eye.\n\n_Val._ Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:\nDumb jewels often in their silent kind                              90\nMore than quick words do move a woman's mind.\n\n_Duke._ But she did scorn a present that I sent her.\n\n_Val._ A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.\nSend her another; never give her o'er;\nFor scorn at first makes afterlove the more.                        95\nIf she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,\nBut rather to beget more love in you:\nIf she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;\nFor why, the fools are mad, if left alone.\nTake no repulse, whatever she doth say;                            100\nFor 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'\nFlatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;\nThough ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.\nThat man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,\nIf with his tongue he cannot win a woman.                          105\n\n_Duke._ But she I mean is promised by her friends\nUnto a youthful gentleman of worth;\nAnd kept severely from resort of men,\nThat no man hath access by day to her.\n\n_Val._ Why, then, I would resort to her by night.                  110\n\n_Duke._ Ay, but the doors be lock'd, and keys kept safe,\nThat no man hath recourse to her by night.\n\n_Val._ What lets but one may enter at her window?\n\n_Duke._ Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,\nAnd built so shelving, that one cannot climb it                    115\nWithout apparent hazard of his life.\n\n_Val._ Why, then, a ladder, quaintly made of cords,\nTo cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,\nWould serve to scale another Hero's tower,\nSo bold Leander would adventure it.                                120\n\n_Duke._ Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,\nAdvise me where I may have such a ladder.\n\n_Val._ When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.\n\n_Duke._ This very night; for Love is like a child,\nThat longs for every thing that he can come by.                    125\n\n_Val._ By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.\n\n_Duke._ But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:\nHow shall I best convey the ladder thither?\n\n_Val._ It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it\nUnder a cloak that is of any length.                               130\n\n_Duke._ A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?\n\n_Val._ Ay, my good lord.\n\n_Duke._                Then let me see thy cloak:\nI'll get me one of such another length.\n\n_Val._ Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.\n\n_Duke._ How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?                    135\nI pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.\nWhat letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!\nAnd here an engine fit for my proceeding.\nI'll be so bold to break the seal for once.    [_Reads._\n\n    'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly;                140\n      And slaves they are to me, that send them flying:\n    O, could their master come and go as lightly,\n      Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!\n    My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them;\n      While I, their king, that thither them importune,            145\n    Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,\n      Because myself do want my servants' fortune:\n    I curse myself, for they are sent by me,\n    That they should harbour where their lord would be.\n\nWhat's here?                                                       150\n\n    'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'\n\n'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.\nWhy, Phaethon,--for thou art Merops' son,--\nWilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car,\nAnd with thy daring folly burn the world?                          155\nWilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?\nGo, base intruder! overweening slave!\nBestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates;\nAnd think my patience, more than thy desert,\nIs privilege for thy departure hence:                              160\nThank me for this more than for all the favours,\nWhich all too much I have bestow'd on thee.\nBut if thou linger in my territories\nLonger than swiftest expedition\nWill give thee time to leave our royal court,                      165\nBy heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love\nI ever bore my daughter or thyself.\nBe gone!

It may be; I'll prove it.            350\nThe cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it is more\nthan the salt; the hair that covers the wit is more than the\nwit, for the greater hides the less.

Out._ Whither travel you?\n\n_Val._ To Verona.\n\n_First Out._ Whence came you?\n\n_Val._ From Milan.\n\n_Third Out._ Have you long sojourned there?                         20\n\n_Val._ Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,\nIf crooked fortune had not thwarted me.\n\n_First Out._ What, were you banish'd thence?\n\n_Val._ I was.\n\n_Sec. Out._ For what offence?                                       25\n\n_Val._ For that which now torments me to rehearse:\nI kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;\nBut yet I slew him manfully in fight,\nWithout false vantage or base treachery.\n\n_First Out._ Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.              30\nBut were you banish'd for so small a fault?\n\n_Val._ I was, and held me glad of such a doom.\n\n_Sec. Out._ Have you the tongues?\n\n_Val._ My youthful travel therein made me happy,\nOr else I often had been miserable.                                 35\n\n_Third Out._ By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,\nThis fellow were a king for our wild faction!\n\n_First Out._ We'll have him. Sirs, a word.\n\n_Speed._ Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind\nof thievery.                                                        40\n\n_Val._ Peace, villain!\n\n_Sec. Out._ Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?\n\n_Val._ Nothing but my fortune.\n\n_Third Out._ Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,\nSuch as the fury of ungovern'd youth                                45\nThrust from the company of awful men:\nMyself was from Verona banished\nFor practising to steal away a lady,\nAn heir, and near allied unto the duke.\n\n_Sec. Out._ And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,                     50\nWho, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.\n\n_First Out._ And I for such like petty crimes as these.\nBut to the purpose,--for we cite our faults,\nThat they may hold excused our lawless lives;\nAnd partly, seeing you are beautified                               55\nWith goodly shape, and by your own report\nA linguist, and a man of such perfection\nAs we do in our quality much want,--\n\n_Sec. Out._ Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,\nTherefore, above the rest, we parley to you:                        60\nAre you content to be our general?\nTo make a virtue of necessity,\nAnd live, as we do, in this wilderness?\n\n_Third Out._ What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?\nSay ay, and be the captain of us all:                               65\nWe'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,\nLove thee as our commander and our king.\n\n_First Out._ But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.\n\n_Sec. Out._ Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.\n\n_Val._ I take your offer, and will live with you,                   70\nProvided that you do no outrages\nOn silly women or poor passengers.\n\n_Third Out._ No, we detest such vile base practices.\nCome, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,\nAnd show thee all the treasure we have got;                         75\nWhich, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

Trust me, I think 'tis\nalmost day.\n\n_Jul._ Not so; but it hath been the longest night                  135\nThat e'er I watch'd, and the most heaviest.

I have\ntaught him, even as one would say precisely, 'thus I                 5\nwould teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver him as a present\nto Mistress Silvia from my master; and I came no sooner\ninto the dining-chamber, but he steps me to her trencher,\nand steals her capon's leg: O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur\ncannot keep himself in all companies! I would have, as              10\none should say, one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed,\nto be, as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not\nhad more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he\ndid, I think verily he had been hanged for't: sure as I\nlive, he had suffered for't: you shall judge. He thrusts            15\nme himself into the company of three or four gentleman-like\ndogs, under the duke's table: he had not been there--bless\nthe mark!--a pissing while, but all the chamber\nsmelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says one: 'What cur is\nthat?' says another: 'Whip him out,' says the third: 'Hang          20\nhim up,' says the duke. I, having been acquainted with\nthe smell before, knew it was Crab, and goes me to the\nfellow that whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean\nto whip the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You\ndo him the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing             25\nyou wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me\nout of the chamber. How many masters would do this for\nhis servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the stocks\nfor puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had been executed;\nI have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed,               30\notherwise he had suffered for't. Thou thinkest not of this\nnow. Nay, I remember the trick you served me when I\ntook my leave of Madam Silvia: did not I bid thee still\nmark me, and do as I do? when didst thou see me heave\nup my leg, and make water against a gentlewoman's farthingale?      35\ndidst thou ever see me do such a trick?\n\n  _Enter PROTEUS and JULIA._\n\n_Pro._ Sebastian is thy name?

[_Swoons._\n\n_Pro._ Look to the boy.                                             85\n\n_Val._ Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?\nLook up; speak.\n\n_Jul._ O good sir, my master charged me to deliver\na ring to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never\ndone.                                                               90\n\n_Pro._ Where is that ring, boy?\n\n_Jul._                        Here 'tis; this is it.\n\n_Pro._ How! let me see:\nWhy, this is the ring I gave to Julia.\n\n_Jul._ O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:\nThis is the ring you sent to Silvia.                                95\n\n_Pro._ But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart\nI gave this unto Julia.\n\n_Jul._ And Julia herself did give it me;\nAnd Julia herself hath brought it hither.\n\n_Pro._ How! Julia!                                                 100\n\n_Jul._ Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,\nAnd entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.\nHow oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!\nO Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!\nBe thou ashamed that I have took upon me                           105\nSuch an immodest raiment, if shame live\nIn a disguise of love:\nIt is the lesser blot, modesty finds,\nWomen to change their shapes than men their minds.\n\n_Pro._ Than men their minds! 'tis true. O heaven, were man         110\nBut constant, he were perfect! That one error\nFills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:\nInconstancy falls off ere it begins.\nWhat is in Silvia's face, but I may spy\nMore fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?                         115\n\n_Val._ Come, come, a hand from either:\nLet me be blest to make this happy close;\n'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.\n\n_Pro._ Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.\n\n_Jul._ And I mine.                                                 120\n\n  _Enter _Outlaws_, with DUKE and THURIO._\n\n_Outlaws._ A prize, a prize, a prize!\n\n_Val._ Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.\nYour Grace is welcome to a man disgraced,\nBanished Valentine.\n\n_Duke._           Sir Valentine!\n\n_Thu._ Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.                        125\n\n_Val._ Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;\nCome not within the measure of my wrath;\nDo not name Silvia thine; if once again,\nVerona shall not hold thee. Here she stands:\nTake but possession of her with a touch:                           130\nI dare thee but to breathe upon my love.\n\n_Thu._ Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I:\nI hold him but a fool that will endanger\nHis body for a girl that loves him not:\nI claim her not, and therefore she is thine.                       135\n\n_Duke._ The more degenerate and base art thou,\nTo make such means for her as thou hast done,\nAnd leave her on such slight conditions.\nNow, by the honour of my ancestry,\nI do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,                                140\nAnd think thee worthy of an empress' love:\nKnow, then, I here forget all former griefs,\nCancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,\nPlead a new state in thy unrival'd merit,\nTo which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,                          145\nThou art a gentleman, and well derived;\nTake thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.\n\n_Val._ I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.\nI now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,\nTo grant one boon that I shall ask of you.                         150\n\n_Duke._ I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.\n\n_Val._ These banish'd men that I have kept withal\nAre men endued with worthy qualities:\nForgive them what they have committed here,\nAnd let them be recall'd from their exile:                         155\nThey are reformed, civil, full of good,\nAnd fit for great employment, worthy lord.\n\n_Duke._ Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:\nDispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.\nCome, let us go: we will include all jars                          160\nWith triumphs, mirth, and rare solemnity.\n\n_Val._ And, as we walk along, I dare be bold\nWith our discourse to make your Grace to smile.\nWhat think you of this page, my lord?\n\n_Duke._ I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.             165\n\n_Val._ I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.\n\n_Duke._ What mean you by that saying?\n\n_Val._ Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,\nThat you will wonder what hath fortuned.\nCome, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear                       170\nThe story of your loves discovered:\nThat done, our day of marriage shall be yours;\nOne feast, one house, one mutual happiness.

Athens. A room in the Palace of THESEUS.\n\n[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants.]\n\nTHESEUS\nNow, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour\nDraws on apace; four happy days bring in\nAnother moon; but, oh, methinks, how slow\nThis old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,\nLike to a step-dame or a dowager,\nLong withering out a young man's revenue.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nFour days will quickly steep themselves in nights;\nFour nights will quickly dream away the time;\nAnd then the moon, like to a silver bow\nNew bent in heaven, shall behold the night\nOf our solemnities.\n\nTHESEUS\n                    Go, Philostrate,\nStir up the Athenian youth to merriments;\nAwake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;\nTurn melancholy forth to funerals--\nThe pale companion is not for our pomp. --\n\n[Exit PHILOSTRATE.]\n\nHippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,\nAnd won thy love doing thee injuries;\nBut I will wed thee in another key,\nWith pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.\n\n[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS.]\n\nEGEUS\nHappy be Theseus, our renowned duke!\n\nTHESEUS\nThanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?\n\nEGEUS\nFull of vexation come I, with complaint\nAgainst my child, my daughter Hermia.--\nStand forth, Demetrius.--My noble lord,\nThis man hath my consent to marry her:--\nStand forth, Lysander;--and, my gracious duke,\nThis man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child.\nThou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,\nAnd interchang'd love-tokens with my child:\nThou hast by moonlight at her window sung,\nWith feigning voice, verses of feigning love;\nAnd stol'n the impression of her fantasy\nWith bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,\nKnacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats,--messengers\nOf strong prevailment in unharden'd youth;--\nWith cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart;\nTurned her obedience, which is due to me,\nTo stubborn harshness.--And, my gracious duke,\nBe it so she will not here before your grace\nConsent to marry with Demetrius,\nI beg the ancient privilege of Athens,--\nAs she is mine I may dispose of her:\nWhich shall be either to this gentleman\nOr to her death; according to our law\nImmediately provided in that case.\n\nTHESEUS\nWhat say you, Hermia? be advis'd, fair maid:\nTo you your father should be as a god;\nOne that compos'd your beauties: yea, and one\nTo whom you are but as a form in wax,\nBy him imprinted, and within his power\nTo leave the figure, or disfigure it.\nDemetrius is a worthy gentleman.\n\nHERMIA\nSo is Lysander.\n\nTHESEUS\n                In himself he is:\nBut, in this kind, wanting your father's voice,\nThe other must be held the worthier.\n\nHERMIA\nI would my father look'd but with my eyes.\n\nTHESEUS\nRather your eyes must with his judgment look.\n\nHERMIA\nI do entreat your grace to pardon me.\nI know not by what power I am made bold,\nNor how it may concern my modesty\nIn such a presence here to plead my thoughts:\nBut I beseech your grace that I may know\nThe worst that may befall me in this case\nIf I refuse to wed Demetrius.\n\nTHESEUS\nEither to die the death, or to abjure\nFor ever the society of men.\nTherefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,\nKnow of your youth, examine well your blood,\nWhether, if you yield not to your father's choice,\nYou can endure the livery of a nun;\nFor aye to be shady cloister mew'd,\nTo live a barren sister all your life,\nChanting faint hymns to the cold, fruitless moon.\nThrice-blessed they that master so their blood\nTo undergo such maiden pilgrimage:\nBut earthlier happy is the rose distill'd\nThan that which, withering on the virgin thorn,\nGrows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.\n\nHERMIA\nSo will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,\nEre I will yield my virgin patent up\nUnto his lordship, whose unwished yoke\nMy soul consents not to give sovereignty.\n\nTHESEUS\nTake time to pause; and by the next new moon,--\nThe sealing-day betwixt my love and me\nFor everlasting bond of fellowship,--\nUpon that day either prepare to die\nFor disobedience to your father's will;\nOr else to wed Demetrius, as he would;\nOr on Diana's altar to protest\nFor aye austerity and single life.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nRelent, sweet Hermia;--and, Lysander, yield\nThy crazed title to my certain right.\n\nLYSANDER\nYou have her father's love, Demetrius;\nLet me have Hermia's: do you marry him.\n\nEGEUS\nScornful Lysander! true, he hath my love;\nAnd what is mine my love shall render him;\nAnd she is mine; and all my right of her\nI do estate unto Demetrius.\n\nLYSANDER\nI am, my lord, as well deriv'd as he,\nAs well possess'd; my love is more than his;\nMy fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,\nIf not with vantage, as Demetrius's;\nAnd, which is more than all these boasts can be,\nI am belov'd of beauteous Hermia:\nWhy should not I then prosecute my right?\nDemetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,\nMade love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,\nAnd won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,\nDevoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,\nUpon this spotted and inconstant man.\n\nTHESEUS\nI must confess that I have heard so much,\nAnd with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;\nBut, being over-full of self-affairs,\nMy mind did lose it.--But, Demetrius, come;\nAnd come, Egeus; you shall go with me;\nI have some private schooling for you both.--\nFor you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself\nTo fit your fancies to your father's will,\nOr else the law of Athens yields you up,--\nWhich by no means we may extenuate,--\nTo death, or to a vow of single life.--\nCome, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?\nDemetrius, and Egeus, go along;\nI must employ you in some business\nAgainst our nuptial, and confer with you\nOf something nearly that concerns yourselves.\n\nEGEUS\nWith duty and desire we follow you.\n\n[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, DEMETRIUS, and Train.]\n\nLYSANDER\nHow now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?\nHow chance the roses there do fade so fast?\n\nHERMIA\nBelike for want of rain, which I could well\nBeteem them from the tempest of my eyes.\n\nLYSANDER\nAh me! for aught that I could ever read,\nCould ever hear by tale or history,\nThe course of true love never did run smooth:\nBut either it was different in blood,--\n\nHERMIA\nO cross! Too high to be enthrall'd to low!\n\nLYSANDER\nOr else misgraffed in respect of years;--\n\nHERMIA\nO spite! Too old to be engag'd to young!\n\nLYSANDER\nOr else it stood upon the choice of friends:\n\nHERMIA\nO hell! to choose love by another's eye!\n\nLYSANDER\nOr, if there were a sympathy in choice,\nWar, death, or sickness, did lay siege to it,\nMaking it momentary as a sound,\nSwift as a shadow, short as any dream;\nBrief as the lightning in the collied night\nThat, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,\nAnd ere a man hath power to say, Behold!\nThe jaws of darkness do devour it up:\nSo quick bright things come to confusion.\n\nHERMIA\nIf then true lovers have ever cross'd,\nIt stands as an edict in destiny:\nThen let us teach our trial patience,\nBecause it is a customary cross;\nAs due to love as thoughts, and dreams, and sighs,\nWishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.\n\nLYSANDER\nA good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.\nI have a widow aunt, a dowager\nOf great revenue, and she hath no child:\nFrom Athens is her house remote seven leagues;\nAnd she respects me as her only son.\nThere, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;\nAnd to that place the sharp Athenian law\nCannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,\nSteal forth thy father's house tomorrow night;\nAnd in the wood, a league without the town,\nWhere I did meet thee once with Helena,\nTo do observance to a morn of May,\nThere will I stay for thee.\n\nHERMIA\n                            My good Lysander!\nI swear to thee by Cupid's strongest bow,\nBy his best arrow, with the golden head,\nBy the simplicity of Venus' doves,\nBy that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,\nAnd by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,\nWhen the false Trojan under sail was seen,--\nBy all the vows that ever men have broke,\nIn number more than ever women spoke,--\nIn that same place thou hast appointed me,\nTomorrow truly will I meet with thee.\n\nLYSANDER\nKeep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.\n\n[Enter HELENA.]\n\nHERMIA\nGod speed fair Helena! Whither away?\n\nHELENA\nCall you me fair? that fair again unsay.\nDemetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!\nYour eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air\nMore tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,\nWhen wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.\nSickness is catching: O, were favour so,\nYours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;\nMy ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,\nMy tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.\nWere the world mine, Demetrius being bated,\nThe rest I'd give to be to you translated.\nO, teach me how you look; and with what art\nYou sway the motion of Demetrius' heart!\n\nHERMIA\nI frown upon him, yet he loves me still.\n\nHELENA\nO that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!\n\nHERMIA\nI give him curses, yet he gives me love.\n\nHELENA\nO that my prayers could such affection move!\n\nHERMIA\nThe more I hate, the more he follows me.\n\nHELENA\nThe more I love, the more he hateth me.\n\nHERMIA\nHis folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.\n\nHELENA\nNone, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!\n\nHERMIA\nTake comfort; he no more shall see my face;\nLysander and myself will fly this place.--\nBefore the time I did Lysander see,\nSeem'd Athens as a paradise to me:\nO, then, what graces in my love do dwell,\nThat he hath turn'd a heaven unto hell!\n\nLYSANDER\nHelen, to you our minds we will unfold:\nTo-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold\nHer silver visage in the watery glass,\nDecking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,--\nA time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,--\nThrough Athens' gates have we devis'd to steal.\n\nHERMIA\nAnd in the wood where often you and I\nUpon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,\nEmptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,\nThere my Lysander and myself shall meet:\nAnd thence from Athens turn away our eyes,\nTo seek new friends and stranger companies.\nFarewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us,\nAnd good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!--\nKeep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight\nFrom lovers' food, till morrow deep midnight.\n\nLYSANDER\nI will, my Hermia.\n\n[Exit HERMIA.]\n\nLYSANDER\n                   Helena, adieu:\nAs you on him, Demetrius dote on you!\n\n[Exit LYSANDER.]\n\nHELENA\nHow happy some o'er other some can be!\nThrough Athens I am thought as fair as she.\nBut what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;\nHe will not know what all but he do know.\nAnd as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,\nSo I, admiring of his qualities.\nThings base and vile, holding no quantity,\nLove can transpose to form and dignity.\nLove looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;\nAnd therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind.\nNor hath love's mind of any judgment taste;\nWings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:\nAnd therefore is love said to be a child,\nBecause in choice he is so oft beguil'd.\nAs waggish boys in game themselves forswear,\nSo the boy Love is perjur'd everywhere:\nFor ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,\nHe hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;\nAnd when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,\nSo he dissolv'd, and showers of oaths did melt.\nI will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight;\nThen to the wood will he to-morrow night\nPursue her; and for this intelligence\nIf I have thanks, it is a dear expense:\nBut herein mean I to enrich my pain,\nTo have his sight thither and back again.\n\n[Exit HELENA.]\n\n\n\nSCENE II. The Same. A Room in a Cottage.\n\n[Enter SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, QUINCE, and STARVELING.]\n\nQUINCE\nIs all our company here?\n\nBOTTOM\nYou were best to call them generally, man by man,\naccording to the scrip.\n\nQUINCE\nHere is the scroll of every man's name, which is thought\nfit, through all Athens, to play in our interlude before the\nduke and duchess on his wedding-day at night.\n\nBOTTOM\nFirst, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on;\nthen read the names of the actors; and so grow to a point.\n\nQUINCE\nMarry, our play is--The most lamentable comedy and most\ncruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.\n\nBOTTOM\nA very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry.--\nNow, good Peter Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll.--\nMasters, spread yourselves.\n\nQUINCE\nAnswer, as I call you.--Nick Bottom, the weaver.\n\nBOTTOM\nReady. Name what part I am for, and proceed.\n\nQUINCE\nYou, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM\nWhat is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?\n\nQUINCE\nA lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.\n\nBOTTOM\nThat will ask some tears in the true performing of it.\nIf I do it, let the audience look to their eyes; I will move\nstorms; I will condole in some measure. To the rest:--yet my\nchief humour is for a tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a\npart to tear a cat in, to make all split.\n\nThe raging rocks\nAnd shivering shocks\nShall break the locks\n    Of prison gates:\n\nAnd Phibbus' car\nShall shine from far,\nAnd make and mar\n    The foolish Fates.\n\nThis was lofty.--Now name the rest of the players.--This is\nErcles' vein, a tyrant's vein;--a lover is more condoling.\n\nQUINCE\nFrancis Flute, the bellows-mender.\n\nFLUTE\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE\nFlute, you must take Thisby on you.\n\nFLUTE\nWhat is Thisby? a wandering knight?\n\nQUINCE\nIt is the lady that Pyramus must love.\n\nFLUTE\nNay, faith, let not me play a woman; I have a beard coming.\n\nQUINCE\nThat's all one; you shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as\nsmall as you will.\n\nBOTTOM\nAn I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too:\nI'll speak in a monstrous little voice;--'Thisne, Thisne!'--\n'Ah, Pyramus, my lover dear; thy Thisby dear! and lady dear!'\n\nQUINCE\nNo, no, you must play Pyramus; and, Flute, you Thisby.\n\nBOTTOM\nWell, proceed.\n\nQUINCE\nRobin Starveling, the tailor.\n\nSTARVELING\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE\nRobin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.--\nTom Snout, the tinker.\n\nSNOUT\nHere, Peter Quince.\n\nQUINCE\nYou, Pyramus' father; myself, Thisby's father;--Snug,\nthe joiner, you, the lion's part:--and, I hope, here is a play\nfitted.\n\nSNUG\nHave you the lion's part written? pray you, if it be, give it\nme, for I am slow of study.\n\nQUINCE\nYou may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.\n\nBOTTOM\nLet me play the lion too: I will roar that I will do\nany man's heart good to hear me; I will roar that I will make the\nduke say 'Let him roar again, let him roar again.'\n\nQUINCE\nAn you should do it too terribly, you would fright the\nduchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; and that were\nenough to hang us all.\n\nALL\nThat would hang us every mother's son.\n\nBOTTOM\nI grant you, friends, if you should fright the ladies\nout of their wits, they would have no more discretion but to hang\nus: but I will aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as\ngently as any sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any\nnightingale.\n\nQUINCE\nYou can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a\nsweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a summer's\nday; a most lovely gentleman-like man; therefore you must\nneeds play Pyramus.\n\nBOTTOM\nWell, I will undertake it. What beard were I best to play it in?\n\nQUINCE\nWhy, what you will.\n\nBOTTOM\nI will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard,\nyour orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain beard, or your\nFrench-crown-colour beard, your perfect yellow.\n\nQUINCE\nSome of your French crowns have no hair at all, and\nthen you will play bare-faced.-- But, masters, here are your\nparts: and I am to entreat you, request you, and desire you, to\ncon them by to-morrow night; and meet me in the palace wood, a\nmile without the town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse: for\nif we meet in the city, we shall be dogg'd with company, and our\ndevices known. In the meantime I will draw a bill of properties,\nsuch as our play wants. I pray you, fail me not.\n\nBOTTOM\nWe will meet; and there we may rehearse most obscenely\nand courageously. Take pains; be perfect; adieu.\n\nQUINCE\nAt the duke's oak we meet.\n\nBOTTOM\nEnough; hold, or cut bow-strings.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\nACT II.\n\n\nSCENE I.

Why art thou here,\nCome from the farthest steep of India,\nBut that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,\nYour buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,\nTo Theseus must be wedded; and you come\nTo give their bed joy and prosperity.\n\nOBERON\nHow canst thou thus, for shame, Titania,\nGlance at my credit with Hippolyta,\nKnowing I know thy love to Theseus?\nDidst not thou lead him through the glimmering night\nFrom Perigenia, whom he ravish'd?\nAnd make him with fair Aegle break his faith,\nWith Ariadne and Antiopa?\n\nTITANIA\nThese are the forgeries of jealousy:\nAnd never, since the middle summer's spring,\nMet we on hill, in dale, forest, or mead,\nBy paved fountain, or by rushy brook,\nOr on the beached margent of the sea,\nTo dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,\nBut with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.\nTherefore the winds, piping to us in vain,\nAs in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea\nContagious fogs; which, falling in the land,\nHath every pelting river made so proud\nThat they have overborne their continents:\nThe ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,\nThe ploughman lost his sweat; and the green corn\nHath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard:\nThe fold stands empty in the drowned field,\nAnd crows are fatted with the murrion flock;\nThe nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud;\nAnd the quaint mazes in the wanton green,\nFor lack of tread, are undistinguishable:\nThe human mortals want their winter here;\nNo night is now with hymn or carol blest:--\nTherefore the moon, the governess of floods,\nPale in her anger, washes all the air,\nThat rheumatic diseases do abound:\nAnd thorough this distemperature we see\nThe seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts\nFall in the fresh lap of the crimson rose;\nAnd on old Hyem's thin and icy crown\nAn odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds\nIs, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,\nThe childing autumn, angry winter, change\nTheir wonted liveries; and the maz'd world,\nBy their increase, now knows not which is which:\nAnd this same progeny of evils comes\nFrom our debate, from our dissension:\nWe are their parents and original.\n\nOBERON\nDo you amend it, then: it lies in you:\nWhy should Titania cross her Oberon?\nI do but beg a little changeling boy\nTo be my henchman.\n\nTITANIA\n                   Set your heart at rest;\nThe fairy-land buys not the child of me.\nHis mother was a vot'ress of my order:\nAnd, in the spiced Indian air, by night,\nFull often hath she gossip'd by my side;\nAnd sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,\nMarking the embarked traders on the flood;\nWhen we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive,\nAnd grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;\nWhich she, with pretty and with swimming gait\nFollowing,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--\nWould imitate; and sail upon the land,\nTo fetch me trifles, and return again,\nAs from a voyage, rich with merchandise.\nBut she, being mortal, of that boy did die;\nAnd for her sake do I rear up her boy:\nAnd for her sake I will not part with him.\n\nOBERON\nHow long within this wood intend you stay?\n\nTITANIA\nPerchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.\nIf you will patiently dance in our round,\nAnd see our moonlight revels, go with us;\nIf not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.\n\nOBERON\nGive me that boy and I will go with thee.\n\nTITANIA\nNot for thy fairy kingdom.

Fie, Demetrius!\nYour wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:\nWe cannot fight for love as men may do:\nWe should be woo'd, and were not made to woo.\nI'll follow thee, and make a heaven of hell,\nTo die upon the hand I love so well.\n\n[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and HELENA.]\n\nOBERON\nFare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,\nThou shalt fly him, and he shall seek thy love.--\n\n[Re-enter PUCK.]\n\nHast thou the flower there?

This green plot shall be our stage, this hawthorn\nbrake our tiring-house; and we will do it in action, as we will\ndo it before the duke.\n\nBOTTOM\nPeter Quince,--\n\nQUINCE\nWhat sayest thou, bully Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM\nThere are things in this comedy of 'Pyramus and Thisby' that\nwill never please. First, Pyramus must draw a sword to kill\nhimself; which the ladies cannot abide. How answer you that?\n\nSNOUT\nBy'r lakin, a parlous fear.\n\nSTARVELING\nI believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.\n\nBOTTOM\nNot a whit: I have a device to make all well. Write me a\nprologue; and let the prologue seem to say we will do no harm\nwith our swords, and that Pyramus is not killed indeed; and for\nthe more better assurance, tell them that I Pyramus am not\nPyramus but Bottom the weaver: this will put them out of fear.\n\nQUINCE\nWell, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be\nwritten in eight and six.\n\nBOTTOM\nNo, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.\n\nSNOUT\nWill not the ladies be afeard of the lion?\n\nSTARVELING\nI fear it, I promise you.\n\nBOTTOM\nMasters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to bring in,\nGod shield us! a lion among ladies is a most dreadful thing:\nfor there is not a more fearful wild-fowl than your lion living;\nand we ought to look to it.\n\nSNOUT\nTherefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.\n\nBOTTOM\nNay, you must name his name, and half his face must be seen\nthrough the lion's neck; and he himself must speak through,\nsaying thus, or to the same defect,--'Ladies,' or, 'Fair ladies, I\nwould wish you, or, I would request you, or, I would entreat you,\nnot to fear, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you think I\ncome hither as a lion, it were pity of my life. No, I am no such\nthing; I am a man as other men are:'--and there, indeed, let him\nname his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.\n\nQUINCE\nWell, it shall be so. But there is two hard things; that\nis, to bring the moonlight into a chamber: for, you know,\nPyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight.\n\nSNOUT\nDoth the moon shine that night we play our play?\n\nBOTTOM\nA calendar, a calendar! look in the almanack; find out\nmoonshine, find out moonshine.\n\nQUINCE\nYes, it doth shine that night.\n\nBOTTOM\nWhy, then may you leave a casement of the great chamber-window,\nwhere we play, open; and the moon may shine in at the casement.\n\nQUINCE\nAy; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a\nlantern, and say he comes to disfigure or to present the person\nof moonshine. Then there is another thing: we must have a\nwall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby, says the\nstory, did talk through the chink of a wall.\n\nSNOUT\nYou can never bring in a wall.--What say you, Bottom?\n\nBOTTOM\nSome man or other must present wall: and let him have\nsome plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast about him, to\nsignify wall; and let him hold his fingers thus, and through that\ncranny shall Pyramus and Thisby whisper.\n\nQUINCE\nIf that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down, every\nmother's son, and rehearse your parts. Pyramus, you begin:\nwhen you have spoken your speech, enter into that brake; and so\nevery one according to his cue.\n\n[Enter PUCK behind.]\n\nPUCK\nWhat hempen homespuns have we swaggering here,\nSo near the cradle of the fairy queen?\nWhat, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;\nAn actor too perhaps, if I see cause.\n\nQUINCE\nSpeak, Pyramus.--Thisby, stand forth.\n\nPYRAMUS\n  'Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,'\n\nQUINCE\nOdours, odours.\n\nPYRAMUS\n  '--odours savours sweet:\n  So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.--\nBut hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,\n  And by and by I will to thee appear.'\n\n[Exit.]\n\nPUCK\nA stranger Pyramus than e'er played here!\n\n[Aside.--Exit.]\n\nTHISBE\nMust I speak now?\n\nQUINCE\nAy, marry, must you: for you must understand he goes\nbut to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.\n\nTHISBE\n  'Most radiant Pyramus, most lily white of hue,\n  Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,\nMost brisky juvenal, and eke most lovely Jew,\n  As true as truest horse, that would never tire,\nI'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.'\n\nQUINCE\nNinus' tomb, man: why, you must not speak that yet:\nthat you answer to Pyramus.

None of noble sort\nWould so offend a virgin, and extort\nA poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.\n\nLYSANDER\nYou are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;\nFor you love Hermia: this you know I know:\nAnd here, with all good will, with all my heart,\nIn Hermia's love I yield you up my part;\nAnd yours of Helena to me bequeath,\nWhom I do love and will do till my death.\n\nHELENA\nNever did mockers waste more idle breath.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nLysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:\nIf e'er I lov'd her, all that love is gone.\nMy heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd;\nAnd now to Helen is it home return'd,\nThere to remain.\n\nLYSANDER\n                 Helen, it is not so.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nDisparage not the faith thou dost not know,\nLest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.--\nLook where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.\n\n[Enter HERMIA.]\n\nHERMIA\nDark night, that from the eye his function takes,\nThe ear more quick of apprehension makes;\nWherein it doth impair the seeing sense,\nIt pays the hearing double recompense:--\nThou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;\nMine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound.\nBut why unkindly didst thou leave me so?\n\nLYSANDER\nWhy should he stay whom love doth press to go?\n\nHERMIA\nWhat love could press Lysander from my side?\n\nLYSANDER\nLysander's love, that would not let him bide,--\nFair Helena,--who more engilds the night\nThan all yon fiery oes and eyes of light.\nWhy seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know\nThe hate I bare thee made me leave thee so?\n\nHERMIA\nYou speak not as you think; it cannot be.\n\nHELENA\nLo, she is one of this confederacy!\nNow I perceive they have conjoin'd all three\nTo fashion this false sport in spite of me.\nInjurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!\nHave you conspir'd, have you with these contriv'd,\nTo bait me with this foul derision?\nIs all the counsel that we two have shar'd,\nThe sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,\nWhen we have chid the hasty-footed time\nFor parting us,--O, is all forgot?\nAll school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?\nWe, Hermia, like two artificial gods,\nHave with our needles created both one flower,\nBoth on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,\nBoth warbling of one song, both in one key;\nAs if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,\nHad been incorporate. So we grew together,\nLike to a double cherry, seeming parted;\nBut yet a union in partition,\nTwo lovely berries moulded on one stem:\nSo, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;\nTwo of the first, like coats in heraldry,\nDue but to one, and crowned with one crest.\nAnd will you rent our ancient love asunder,\nTo join with men in scorning your poor friend?\nIt is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:\nOur sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,\nThough I alone do feel the injury.\n\nHERMIA\nI am amazed at your passionate words:\nI scorn you not; it seems that you scorn me.\n\nHELENA\nHave you not set Lysander, as in scorn,\nTo follow me, and praise my eyes and face?\nAnd made your other love, Demetrius,--\nWho even but now did spurn me with his foot,--\nTo call me goddess, nymph, divine, and rare,\nPrecious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this\nTo her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander\nDeny your love, so rich within his soul,\nAnd tender me, forsooth, affection,\nBut by your setting on, by your consent?\nWhat though I be not so in grace as you,\nSo hung upon with love, so fortunate;\nBut miserable most, to love unlov'd?\nThis you should pity rather than despise.\n\nHERMIA\nI understand not what you mean by this.\n\nHELENA\nAy, do persever, counterfeit sad looks,\nMake mows upon me when I turn my back;\nWink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:\nThis sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.\nIf you have any pity, grace, or manners,\nYou would not make me such an argument.\nBut fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;\nWhich death, or absence, soon shall remedy.\n\nLYSANDER\nStay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse;\nMy love, my life, my soul, fair Helena!\n\nHELENA\nO excellent!\n\nHERMIA\n             Sweet, do not scorn her so.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nIf she cannot entreat, I can compel.\n\nLYSANDER\nThou canst compel no more than she entreat;\nThy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.--\nHelen, I love thee; by my life I do;\nI swear by that which I will lose for thee\nTo prove him false that says I love thee not.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nI say I love thee more than he can do.\n\nLYSANDER\nIf thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nQuick, come,--\n\nHERMIA\n               Lysander, whereto tends all this?\n\nLYSANDER\nAway, you Ethiope!\n\nDEMETRIUS\n                   No, no, sir:--he will\nSeem to break loose; take on as you would follow:\nBut yet come not.

Ay, that way goes the game.\nNow I perceive that she hath made compare\nBetween our statures; she hath urg'd her height;\nAnd with her personage, her tall personage,\nHer height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.--\nAnd are you grown so high in his esteem\nBecause I am so dwarfish and so low?\nHow low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;\nHow low am I? I am not yet so low\nBut that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.\n\nHELENA\nI pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,\nLet her not hurt me.

The\neye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen; man's\nhand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceive, nor his heart\nto report, what my dream was. I will get Peter Quince to write a\nballad of this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream, because\nit hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the latter end of a\nplay, before the duke: peradventure, to make it the more\ngracious, I shall sing it at her death.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\n\nSCENE II.

That you should here repent you,\nThe actors are at hand: and, by their show,\nYou shall know all that you are like to know,'\n\nTHESEUS\nThis fellow doth not stand upon points.\n\nLYSANDER\nHe hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows\nnot the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not enough to speak,\nbut to speak true.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nIndeed he hath played on this prologue like a child\non a recorder; a sound, but not in government.\n\nTHESEUS\nHis speech was like a tangled chain; nothing impaired, but all\ndisordered. Who is next?\n\n[Enter PYRAMUS and THISBE, WALL, MOONSHINE, and LION, as in dumb\nshow.]\n\nPROLOGUE\nGentles, perchance you wonder at this show;\n  But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.\nThis man is Pyramus, if you would know;\n  This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.\nThis man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present\n  Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;\nAnd through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content\n  To whisper, at the which let no man wonder.\nThis man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,\n  Presenteth Moonshine: for, if you will know,\nBy moonshine did these lovers think no scorn\n  To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.\nThis grisly beast, which by name Lion hight,\nThe trusty Thisby, coming first by night,\nDid scare away, or rather did affright;\nAnd as she fled, her mantle she did fall;\n  Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain:\nAnon comes Pyramus, sweet youth, and tall,\n  And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain;\nWhereat with blade, with bloody blameful blade,\n  He bravely broach'd his boiling bloody breast;\nAnd Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,\n  His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,\nLet Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain,\nAt large discourse while here they do remain.\n\n[Exeunt PROLOGUE, THISBE, LION, and MOONSHINE.]\n\nTHESEUS\nI wonder if the lion be to speak.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nNo wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.\n\nWALL\nIn this same interlude it doth befall\nThat I, one Snout by name, present a wall:\nAnd such a wall as I would have you think\nThat had in it a crannied hole or chink,\nThrough which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,\nDid whisper often very secretly.\nThis loam, this rough-cast, and this stone, doth show\nThat I am that same wall; the truth is so:\nAnd this the cranny is, right and sinister,\nThrough which the fearful lovers are to whisper.\n\nTHESEUS\nWould you desire lime and hair to speak better?\n\nDEMETRIUS\nIt is the wittiest partition that ever I heard\ndiscourse, my lord.\n\nTHESEUS\nPyramus draws near the wall; silence.\n\n[Enter PYRAMUS.]\n\nPYRAMUS\nO grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!\n  O night, which ever art when day is not!\nO night, O night, alack, alack, alack,\n I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!--\nAnd thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,\n That stand'st between her father's ground and mine;\nThou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,\n  Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne.\n\n[WALL holds up his fingers.]\n\nThanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!\n  But what see what see I? No Thisby do I see.\nO wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss,\n  Curs'd be thy stones for thus deceiving me!\n\nTHESEUS\nThe wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.\n\nPYRAMUS\nNo, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me' is\nThisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to spy her through\nthe wall. You shall see it will fall pat as I told you.--Yonder\nshe comes.\n\n[Enter THISBE.]\n\nTHISBE\nO wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,\n  For parting my fair Pyramus and me:\nMy cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones:\n  Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.\n\nPYRAMUS\nI see a voice; now will I to the chink,\nTo spy an I can hear my Thisby's face.\nThisby!\n\nTHISBE\n        My love! thou art my love, I think.\n\nPYRAMUS\nThink what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;\nAnd like Limander am I trusty still.\n\nTHISBE\nAnd I like Helen, till the fates me kill.\n\nPYRAMUS\nNot Shafalus to Procrus was so true.\n\nTHISBE\nAs Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.\n\nPYRAMUS\nO, kiss me through the hole of this vile wall.\n\nTHISBE\nI kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.\n\nPYRAMUS\nWilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?\n\nTHISBE\n'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.\n\nWALL\nThus have I, wall, my part discharged so;\nAnd, being done, thus Wall away doth go.\n\n[Exeunt WALL, PYRAMUS and THISBE.]\n\nTHESEUS\nNow is the mural down between the two neighbours.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nNo remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear\nwithout warning.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nThis is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.\n\nTHESEUS\nThe best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst\nare no worse, if imagination amend them.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nIt must be your imagination then, and not theirs.\n\nTHESEUS\nIf we imagine no worse of them than they of\nthemselves, they may pass for excellent men.\nHere come two noble beasts in, a moon and a lion.\n\n[Enter LION and MOONSHINE.]\n\nLION\nYou, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear\n  The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,\nMay now, perchance, both quake and tremble here,\n  When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.\nThen know that I, one Snug the joiner, am\nA lion fell, nor else no lion's dam:\nFor, if I should as lion come in strife\nInto this place, 'twere pity on my life.\n\nTHESEUS\nA very gentle beast, and of a good conscience.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nThe very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.\n\nLYSANDER\nThis lion is a very fox for his valour.\n\nTHESEUS\nTrue; and a goose for his discretion.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nNot so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his\ndiscretion, and the fox carries the goose.\n\nTHESEUS\nHis discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;\nfor the goose carries not the fox. It is well; leave it to his\ndiscretion, and let us listen to the moon.\n\nMOONSHINE\nThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present:\n\nDEMETRIUS\nHe should have worn the horns on his head.\n\nTHESEUS\nHe is no crescent, and his horns are invisible within\nthe circumference.\n\nMOONSHINE\nThis lanthorn doth the horned moon present;\nMyself the man i' the moon do seem to be.\n\nTHESEUS\nThis is the greatest error of all the rest: the man should be\nput into the lantern. How is it else the man i' the moon?\n\nDEMETRIUS\nHe dares not come there for the candle: for, you\nsee, it is already in snuff.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nI am aweary of this moon: would he would change!\n\nTHESEUS\nIt appears, by his small light of discretion, that he\nis in the wane: but yet, in courtesy, in all reason, we must\nstay the time.\n\nLYSANDER\nProceed, moon.\n\nMOON\nAll that I have to say, is to tell you that the lantern\nis the moon; I, the man i' the moon; this thorn-bush, my\nthorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nWhy, all these should be in the lantern; for all\nthese are in the moon. But silence; here comes Thisbe.\n\n[Enter THISBE.]\n\nTHISBE\nThis is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?\n\nLION\nOh!\n\n[The LION roars.--THISBE runs off.]\n\nDEMETRIUS\nWell roared, lion.\n\nTHESEUS\nWell run, Thisbe.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nWell shone, moon.--Truly, the moon shines with a good grace.\n\n[The LION tears THISBE'S Mantle, and exit.]\n\nTHESEUS\nWell moused, lion.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nAnd so comes Pyramus.\n\nLYSANDER\nAnd then the lion vanishes.\n\n[Enter PYRAMUS.]\n\nPYRAMUS\nSweet moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;\n  I thank thee, moon, for shining now so bright:\nFor, by thy gracious golden, glittering streams,\n  I trust to take of truest Thisby's sight.\n      But stay;--O spite!\n      But mark,--poor knight,\n    What dreadful dole is here!\n      Eyes, do you see?\n      How can it be?\n    O dainty duck! O dear!\n      Thy mantle good,\n      What! stained with blood?\n    Approach, ye furies fell!\n      O fates! come, come;\n      Cut thread and thrum;\n    Quail, rush, conclude, and quell!\n\nTHESEUS\nThis passion, and the death of a dear friend, would go\nnear to make a man look sad.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nBeshrew my heart, but I pity the man.\n\nPYRAMUS\nO wherefore, nature, didst thou lions frame?\n  Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear;\nWhich is--no, no--which was the fairest dame\n  That liv'd, that lov'd, that lik'd, that look'd with cheer.\n      Come, tears, confound;\n      Out, sword, and wound\n    The pap of Pyramus:\n      Ay, that left pap,\n      Where heart doth hop:--\n    Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.\n      Now am I dead,\n      Now am I fled;\n    My soul is in the sky:\n      Tongue, lose thy light!\n      Moon, take thy flight!\n    Now die, die, die, die, die.\n\n[Dies. Exit MOONSHINE.]\n\nDEMETRIUS\nNo die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.\n\nLYSANDER\nLess than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.\n\nTHESEUS\nWith the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass.\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nHow chance moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes\nback and finds her lover?\n\nTHESEUS\nShe will find him by starlight.--Here she comes; and\nher passion ends the play.\n\n[Enter THISBE.]\n\nHIPPOLYTA\nMethinks she should not use a long one for such a\nPyramus: I hope she will be brief.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nA mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which\nThisbe, is the better.\n\nLYSANDER\nShe hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nAnd thus she moans, videlicet.--\n\nTHISBE\n     Asleep, my love?\n     What, dead, my dove?\n   O Pyramus, arise,\n     Speak, speak. Quite dumb?\n     Dead, dead? A tomb\n   Must cover thy sweet eyes.\n     These lily lips,\n     This cherry nose,\n   These yellow cowslip cheeks,\n     Are gone, are gone:\n     Lovers, make moan!\n   His eyes were green as leeks.\n     O Sisters Three,\n     Come, come to me,\n   With hands as pale as milk;\n     Lay them in gore,\n     Since you have shore\n   With shears his thread of silk.\n     Tongue, not a word:--\n     Come, trusty sword;\n   Come, blade, my breast imbrue;\n     And farewell, friends:--\n     Thus Thisbe ends;\n   Adieu, adieu, adieu.\n\n[Dies.]\n\nTHESEUS\nMoonshine and lion are left to bury the dead.\n\nDEMETRIUS\nAy, and wall too.\n\nBOTTOM\nNo, I assure you; the wall is down that parted their fathers.\nWill it please you to see the epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask\ndance between two of our company?\n\nTHESEUS\nNo epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no\nexcuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all dead there\nneed none to be blamed. Marry, if he that writ it had played\nPyramus, and hang'd himself in Thisbe's garter, it would have\nbeen a fine tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably\ndischarged. But come, your Bergomask; let your epilogue alone.\n\n[Here a dance of Clowns.]\n\nThe iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:--\nLovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.\nI fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn,\nAs much as we this night have overwatch'd.\nThis palpable-gross play hath well beguil'd\nThe heavy gait of night.--Sweet friends, to bed.--\nA fortnight hold we this solemnity,\nIn nightly revels and new jollity.\n\n[Exeunt.]\n\n\n\nSCENE II\n\n[Enter PUCK.]\n\nPUCK\n  Now the hungry lion roars,\n   And the wolf behowls the moon;\n  Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,\n   All with weary task fordone.\n  Now the wasted brands do glow,\n   Whilst the scritch-owl, scritching loud,\n  Puts the wretch that lies in woe\n   In remembrance of a shroud.\n  Now it is the time of night\n   That the graves, all gaping wide,\n  Every one lets forth its sprite,\n   In the church-way paths to glide:\n  And we fairies, that do run\n   By the triple Hecate's team\n  From the presence of the sun,\n   Following darkness like a dream,\n  Now are frolic; not a mouse\n   Shall disturb this hallow'd house:\n  I am sent with broom before,\n   To sweep the dust behind the door.\n\n[Enter OBERON and TITANIA, with their Train.]\n\nOBERON\n  Through the house give glimmering light,\n    By the dead and drowsy fire:\n  Every elf and fairy sprite\n    Hop as light as bird from brier:\n  And this ditty, after me,\n  Sing and dance it trippingly.\n\nTITANIA\n  First, rehearse your song by rote,\n    To each word a warbling note;\n  Hand in hand, with fairy grace,\n  Will we sing, and bless this place.\n\n[Song and Dance.]\n\nOBERON\n  Now, until the break of day,\n  Through this house each fairy stray,\n  To the best bride-bed will we,\n  Which by us shall blessed be;\n  And the issue there create\n  Ever shall be fortunate.\n  So shall all the couples three\n  Ever true in loving be;\n  And the blots of Nature's hand\n  Shall not in their issue stand:\n  Never mole, hare-lip, nor scar,\n  Nor mark prodigious, such as are\n  Despised in nativity,\n  Shall upon their children be.--\n  With this field-dew consecrate,\n  Every fairy take his gate;\n  And each several chamber bless,\n  Through this palace, with sweet peace;\n  E'er shall it in safety rest,\n  And the owner of it blest.\n    Trip away:\n    Make no stay:\n  Meet me all by break of day.\n\n[Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and Train.]\n\nPUCK\n  If we shadows have offended,\n  Think but this,--and all is mended,--\n  That you have but slumber'd here\n  While these visions did appear.\n  And this weak and idle theme,\n  No more yielding but a dream,\n  Gentles, do not reprehend;\n  If you pardon, we will mend.\n  And, as I am an honest Puck,\n  If we have unearned luck\n  Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,\n  We will make amends ere long;\n  Else the Puck a liar call:\n  So, good night unto you all.\n  Give me your hands, if we be friends,\n  And Robin shall restore amends.\n\n[Exit.]\n\n\n\n\n"
