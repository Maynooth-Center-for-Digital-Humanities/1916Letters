1916Letters
===========

Letter analysis project
Is a students project that I create during an internship on  internship at the Center for High Performance Computing in TCD and the Letters of 1916 project. 
The goal of my internship is to create a text analysis tool for the “Letters of 1916 project”.


The Letters of 1916: Creating History 
is the first crowd-sourced humanities project in Ireland. 
The project was launched on Friday September 27th 2013 at Discover Research Night and invites people all over the world to share letters 
written during and related to the Easter Rising of 1916. Images of letters can be uploaded, read online and transcribed. 
This project focuses especially on private collections and the letters and voices of people that were less well known or even forgotten.
